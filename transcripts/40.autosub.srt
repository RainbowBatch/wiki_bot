Holding

00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,080
Discuss

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
The ongoing

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
What is the downfall

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Which locally lovingly coincides with the

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Alex Jones

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Parallels

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
How to draw

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
Believe that he's the archetype of a technomancer living embodiment of not only his childhood dog

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
But also

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
The Union

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
You know nothing there we go

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,576
Yeah we're going to be able to just get it down to like a half a sentence

15
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,208
Kaboom eventually but it's more fun to draw it out as long as

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
Donator Chris

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
Congratulations on becoming a policy wonk

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
We probably will

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
Hey look

20
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
Anybody's donating

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
F*** it I don't give a s*** this is great

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
It is

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
It is great all those people love what I like this is our third episode and 3 days

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,608
1 2 3 hours and 40 minutes to remember that one

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
People still seem into it

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
So

27
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Thank you all

28
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Yes

29
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
So are we

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
We can talk about what's going on in the world

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
What keeps going around and around in my

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Is that

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
White people

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,344
Would rather end democracy than allow people of color to part

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
Participate the route

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,536
People voted people so blatant

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,120
Play kurupt so absolutely

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
What they were promised

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
And all of the f****** that they

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,872
Bring to mind the idea of like Manson Helter Skelter

41
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
We're going to precipitate a race or class war

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
Other off and then we will

43
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
We'll hide out in Romanian

44
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Welcome

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Freestyle Libre

46
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,544
But we will however be taking your donations and using them to build a compound that we put into the forest

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
Are welcome to join us

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,736
The class we're going to put it into ahead of Easter Island there is welcome

49
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Prince this on yesterday's episode but I

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
FBI director

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Jim Comey

52
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
It was within the Spectre

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Of his

54
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Is growing Russia investigation

55
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
Just before he had gotten fired

56
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
Bye-bye

57
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
Before that he had requested

58
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Resources 2X

59
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,600
Bad ideas strong indication they were really coming to it

60
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Couldn't think of any reason why

61
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
So

62
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
He gets fired

63
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Got the paper trail in the documents

64
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
But come out

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Jeff sessions

66
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
And is that beauty

67
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,752
From the investigation

68
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Trump

69
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
To fire

70
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Jim Comey

71
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,664
But then comes out that Trump had asked them to advise him

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
To fire him

73
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Yeah that makes sense

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
So it's all this circular Dante

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Technically they still did advise him

76
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,880
M22

77
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
Unlike multiple statements Jeff sessions has made under oath

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Absolutely

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
It's bottle

80
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
But the world is a f*****-up place it's not appropriate I don't think so

81
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Compare this to Nixon

82
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
Saturday night Massacre

83
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
Well I think even Beyond it just being worthless

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Princesses are super death

85
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
You know like

86
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
That was just a break

87
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,111
That was just them breaking into something this is

88
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Broken political system Nixon wasn't

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Helping

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
A foreign power

91
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
Break into the Watergate Hotel

92
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
You was doing that for purely selfish reasons

93
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
A selfie

94
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
People involved in Trump's team obviously have self-advancement

95
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
But they are interested in

96
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
But this is directly like

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
I am firing someone

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Who is invest

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Forgetting

100
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Partisanship aside

101
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
I don't give a fuk

102
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
If Obama was under FBI investigation

103
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Have you fired the FBI director

104
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
I would be just as like Blown Away

105
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Republicans

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Would be shooting themselves

107
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
On the front lawn of the White House

108
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
It's insane

109
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,991
Actually I understand that you're speechless but thankfully we have a man who is never

110
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Speechless at our disposal

111
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Is Alexander Emerick Jones

112
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Who went on air today

113
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Looked rough

114
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Look

115
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Hired

116
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
That was what I was getting at

117
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
It's only hair

118
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
And this is how he

119
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
You start that is broadcast

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
Align himself with the proof and it's time for you to choose her side your

121
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Alex Jones

122
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,183
Call area where we get our information from

123
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
That is a direct reference

124
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Two Donald Trump's

125
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
Sources

126
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
Hate to do it even though I did it like a week ago

127
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
I'm sorry I'm sorry cernovich

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
Even though the medium

129
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
Sunbury late last night talking to multiple sources and I called Rodger Stone about 11 Texas

130
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
Midnight Hour

131
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
Multiple sources

132
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
He's talking about the

133
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
Three wise men Johnny Jack and Jim

134
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Y'all talk about

135
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
He was on the phone with the whiskey

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
Fatburger

137
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,495
Very drunken phone calls

138
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
Rodger is it a

139
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,879
Rodger only the Beast

140
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Rogers on people

141
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
Talk to outside the White House

142
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,959
We'll get it on into today but I for my other sources separately have exactly what happened,

143
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Call me was compromised

144
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Compromise for a long time

145
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
And

146
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
But sources

147
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
To try to exert pressure on a house

148
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Can the White House carryout

149
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
Basically

150
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,567
If that is what your source told you your source is

151
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,919
Very non-specific

152
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
You Alex

153
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Sources believe exactly what he is already told

154
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
He's been compromised by globalist

155
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Guitars

156
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
Speculum

157
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
Thank you Alex

158
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Is b*******

159
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,983
And this is what I want to get to become Queer as this goes along

160
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
But this is like I sincerely believe

161
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,871
This is the darkest moment of our politics

162
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
In my life

163
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Agree in the 33 years that I've been alive

164
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Close today

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
I think it's one of the most dangerous time

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
And we don't make the Right Moves

167
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
We could lose

168
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
A lot of Art

169
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
The way Alex Jones is respondent

170
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Memes

171
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
She knows there

172
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
You're f*****

173
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Keno's

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
I believe

175
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Kobe getting fired

176
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Is a nail in the coffin

177
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
For most of the Russia

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
Yeah he knows that Rodger stone is going to prison

179
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
He knows that

180
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Manafort is done

181
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Dino's plan is

182
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
But days away from a grand jury

183
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
He knows these things

184
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Not stupid enough to think they're like

185
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Kobe's going to help that

186
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
And I think you would have to be

187
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Really stupid

188
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
You have to be

189
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Some kind of

190
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Colossal moron a good idea to get rid of

191
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
To be some

192
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Kind

193
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Salute

194
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Smoking

195

00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
Looks like s*** is supplements are not working

234
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
He claims

How old do you think

00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Early forties no f****** way

239
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
If he's 43

240

00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
No

243
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
No way

244
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
And I've lived hard

245
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Better start taking that super male vitality

Anyway

So

249
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Alex Jones

Then didn't prosecute her which I'm not sure

253
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
There is nothing to prosecute

254
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
Not not really she said she was under investigation

255
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847

00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663

00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Castigation Department of Justice

258
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,159
Things that were being looked into by the FBI with

259
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
The Clinton Foundation

260
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
But that wasn't the doj

261
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Well I mean

262
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399

00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
He's very

270
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,159
Andy asked why I don't understand what exactly

271
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Deepstate sources

272
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
But like legitimately

273
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
I'm not cutting out like any real substance

274
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,471
This is the kind of thing he's pointing the finger at he's like everyone knows he was he was strict

Visitors at his next clip is actually where he gives what I would

279
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
Describe is the first time he tries to incite violence

280
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,207
All nervous

281
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
Power talking

282
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,887
Myself in person

283
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,311
Broadcast

284
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
We're not looking for trouble we're not looking for revolution when not looking for blood mast

285
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Does hordes and their

286
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Refugees

287
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
Mobilize West

288
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,607
And we are involved in dereliction of Duty

289
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
So it's

290
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,959
Quite like out out violence as it will be later

291
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
It's the

292
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
Trump saying like people used

293
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
She probably do something

294
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
What about this thing that's going to hit different years differently but beyond

295
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Call to political violence

296
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,367
It's a call to James is like

297
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
Lock it down now

298
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
If you're just trying to like

299
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
You know War Games how to start

300
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Authoritarian regime

301
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
You got to lock it down

302
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Terror

303
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
I mean frankly I think at this point over in

304
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Even better

305
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
A black lives matter protest turns violent

306
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Sure

307
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
I've all democracy is over

308
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Another camp

309
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Campsite with terrorism Mixon

310
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
We are on the razor's Edge

311
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Cougar

312
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
They're martyrs

313
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
But kind of

314
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
It's it's hard to imagine

315
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Any situation

316
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
That this doesn't eventually lead to

317
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
Either

318
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
I mean

319
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
I don't want to stay Civil War

320
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
But I want to say if

321
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,095
If you are America

322
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
In America everybody else is f****** Ironman

323
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
I think they were

324
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Maybe a more delicate way to put it would be like

325
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
What we were talking about earlier with the

326
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
Complicated and dangerous. Of Our Lives

327
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,855
And in order for us to avoid to avoid a revolution

328
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
To avoid a civil war it's like threading a needle

329
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255
There's going to be really precise things that need to be done

330
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Or working a box this thing

331
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
People are going to end up killing me

332
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
Yeah and I'm really glad we have

333
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Right now that

334
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Famous for

335
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Stability threadneedle

336
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
Do you have to really navigate a way to

337
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
Speaking of someone who would never make a good so stress

338
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
I don't know if that's the right word

339
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Seamstress

340
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Do they sell

341
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807

342
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
That's their whole thing it's so stress anyways

343
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,951
I don't really remember exactly what this toaster

344
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Exactly with the Clippers about but it has to do with

345
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Is Attorney General

346
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,359
And then

347
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
President

348
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
While

349
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Yeah

350
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
Wow

351
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,615
The Monstrous kleptocrats

352
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
You know

353
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
Further like we've got a call

00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
Of these Banana Republic Authority

358
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Dictatorship

359
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,655
Punishing their political rivals

360
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
With

361
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Most

362
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,335
If you want Alex is going to give a Litany of charges against Hillary Clinton throughout the rest

363
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Over dictator

364
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
And I don't understand why everything

365
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
He's a strong man and indeed

366
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
7 year old

367
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Mentally deficient

368
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Poorly

369
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
Portion guy who Orange

370
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,407
That's the kind of looks like he has a butthole in his neck flap

371
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Sometimes

372
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
What it folds just right

373
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Yeah

374
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,855
I get I get that that is a decent argument there's a little bit more going on

375
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Butts

376
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231

377
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Does not understand

378
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Subtleties of life at all

379
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
You told him you're fired

380
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
Yes, getting elected

381
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,479
World

382
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
President Trump months ago

383
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
The people wanted him fired when he wrote that letter right before the election

384
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
In that context

385
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,983
And a lot of people still Harbor a lot of feelings about that

386
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,055
But at the same time difference

387
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,151
Who's actively investigating

388
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
It's a bit different

389
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
It's a little bit different

390
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Slick

391
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
They're not at all this

392
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
We're being clipped

393
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
Think of any other situation

394
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Other than

395
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
That Nixon

396
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Firing the

397
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Investigator looking

398
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
Cox

399
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Which Cox

400
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,287
Archibald Cox

401
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Great care

402
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
Archibald Cox

403
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
And Rodger simulator makes a great pun about that

404
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,063
Nixon

405
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Hahaha it's funny cuz Rodger Stone was involved with Nixon to

406
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,352
My favorite part of Rodger Stone beating on is eventually

407
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
I guarantee he's going to be allowed

408
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
To do interviews with Alec prism

409
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
Yeah probably

410
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
Do you have his back

411
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,896
Like its

412
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
I know that's true

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
And I forget it instantly because

414
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
How can that be

415
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
In addition

416
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
To Alex Jones not understanding the subtleties of wanting someone fired for one thing and not wanting

417
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
Empire for a different thing

418
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
So does not understand

419
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
Washington Post

420
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
Building Hillary

421
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Kim Hawk

422
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
Why is it all television

423
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
The British Open

424
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,152
Why is it all those trees

425
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,528
Call Black everybody's thinking about them trees told me David Brock cuz I'm about to correct the record

426
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Almost

427
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
So

428
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
He says

429
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
Trump Express to call me why aren't you invest

430
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
Hillary's

431
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,304
Scribes like the uranium deal

432
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
Pruitt's not real

433
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,704
I've written up and long extensive thing the documents

434
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
Exactly what was going on with that

435
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
She was not

436
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,664
Actively involved in that at all it wasn't uranium deal that sold things to Russia

437
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
It was

438
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
That's just a complete lie

439
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
If the FBI was to investigate her for that

440
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Or anyone was the prosecutor for that

441
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
It would be a bogus prosecution

442
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Why they wouldn't do it is just

443
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
Refer them to knowledge

444
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
You jump

445
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
Dumb assholes

446
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,448
I'm not here to say that Hillary Clinton's ass ain't get her because

447
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
They have fake story

448
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
Sounds good

449
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
And it was in that

450
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
Full of lies documentary Clinton cash

451
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,224
But it's not true it's not real if you get down to the bottom of it

452
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,624
Why you spending all this

453
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,024
It was 100,000 go to Russia

454
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
The fact

455
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,632
Lucky's just admitting why

456
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Piece of it too it's not that

457
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Not it

458
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
If that was it that would be

459
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
But it wouldn't

460
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Experiencing now

461
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
Brett just multiple members

462
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,296
Of Trumps team who have lied under oath about contacts with Russian

463
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Agent

464
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Right

465
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
You have Jared Kushner

466
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
Lying and omitting information on his security clearance form

467
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
About meetings

468
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
You have manafort

469
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,448
And Flynn both retroactively registering

470
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
As

471
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
After they have been fired from Trump's campaign

472
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Your Carter page

473
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Acting like a

474
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
Weirdo on television

475
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Anyone have evidence

476
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
B Mike

477
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
Flynn was working with erdewan

478
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
To try and expedite

479
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Gulen

480
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Cleric

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
Who lives in the other Northeast somewhere

482
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Take him back so he can kill him

483
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
And we

484
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,872
No thank you Mike Flynn was working with a f****** Turkish dictator

485
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,944
Do try and subvert our foreign policy

486
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
For money

487
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
And then on top of that

488
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,672
Really f***** up

489
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Record

490
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Just Mike Flynn went on Russia

491
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Television in sat next

492
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
The Putin that a table

493
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
That's not really what we're talking about

494
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Hillary

495
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Did sell that you reign

496
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Oh well then where

497
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
But you didn't

498
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,896
It's so f***** up it's a false equivalence based on lies on both sides

499
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Like how bad

500
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
The fake thing about Clinton is

501
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
And lying about helping dying the actually really bad stuff about Flynn and the rest of them is

502
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Treating his viewers

503
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Like like

504
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
Babies like he's literally holding up Keys over here

505
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,632
Look at the jangly keys look at the jangly keys

506
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Lordy lordy lordy

507
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,288
All these Jackie cheese over here constantly yells about like

508
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,128
People having no memory and the globalist want you to have no memory

509
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
He's actively exploding or hoping

510
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
But his audience doesn't have a battery

511
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Look

512
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
He f****** praised that they only read Breitbart

513
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
They only do research on

514
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
The f******

515
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Spirit boards on Reddit

516
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
I don't know that's all they do

517
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,864
That's only the only do that

518
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Like

519
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
Zerohedge

520
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
If you still support

521
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Yeah you're or your evil

522
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
I used to add in denial

523
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Now you're just dumb

524
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
You can't be in denial

525
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
You're dumb or you're evil

526
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
That's it

527
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
If you still support Trump

528
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
I am done

529
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I am done protect

530
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Feelings

531
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm done trying to

532
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
1st and Denny

533
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
Your real problem is you are f******

534
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,840
Stupid can I put a fine line of Lights cuz there's a Venn diagram

535
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,888
Between evil and stupid that is racist

536
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,472
Right sort of both but it's not fully either

537
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
You don't remember

538
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,360
It is both but racism isn't only stupidity and it's not only evilness

539
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
It's sort of a nice

540
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
Is Alex B

541
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
So at this point of the show

542
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Alex Jones

543
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
Has a big dick

544
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Effort interview

545
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
That the guy who's on his show almost everyday

546
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,608
Rodger Rodger Stone

547
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Donald Trump's children

548
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
To talk about

549
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
The fact that Tony got fired

550
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
He brings in Rodger Stone

551
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Someone who was a target of the investigation

552
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Activity

553
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,344
He was a member of multiple

554
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Sure everybody knows that he's a

555
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
A trustworthy and reliable source

556
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
There's no doubt about that

557
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
Burning down to the ground

558
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
That's a glamourpuss

559
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Absolutely gorgeous

560
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,616
He is a fashion puss if there ever has been one

561
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,944
Alex Jones introduction

562
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:47,488
He isn't Rodger Stone

563
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
That can't be true I look forward to seeing that obviously

564
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,848
That is coming up in 48 hours on Netflix

565
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:13,344
What's the first aid closing today what is breaking down with coming

566
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
Let's let's go over from your sources

567
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,488
I can't reiterate this enough

568
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
It's a bad

569
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Look

570
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,352
Like in the same way that Trump had

571
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Comey fired

572
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
And then the next day

573
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
He was meeting with

574
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
The foreign minister of Russia

575
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
I would not allow it

576
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Answered

577
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,272
Did the guy because the one guy who is at the center of

578
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Forgot

579
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
He was not announced but he was going to be a part of those meeting

580
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,512
Actually Trump secret Lee met with the same guy that all the multiple Mets

581
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,584
Secretly and yeah they did not allow a

582
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Into the

583
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
The Oval Office

584
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
LOL

585
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
United States press

586
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Bingo allowed

587
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Russian

588
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:10,688
Are inside the Oval Office I know that this is a little bit speculative but I don't

589
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
Any reason to think that the Oval Office has

590
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Bug now

591
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
Like I have no idea

592
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Like why wouldn't

593
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
I mean

594
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Fake deference

595
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,512
Yeah it's a mean if he finds a bug which god dammit

596
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
Yeah

597
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
He could be f******

598
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Peeing into a microphone

599
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
This is a funny plant

600
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
I like it

601
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
All of this stuff is being recorded

602
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,152
I do that future historians

603
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
Will be able to write on Thursday

604
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
What's sure

605
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,368
Stupid people hate black

606
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
That probably

607
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
The point

608
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,536
I was trying to make is that in the same way that is a

609
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,168
You fire the guy who's investigating your ties to Russia and then secretly meet with the guy there

610
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
And before administer

611
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
In the same way that's a bad look

612
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
Alex Jones having an interview with

613
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
The guy

614
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Who was under investigation about the firing

615
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
Of the guy truly investigating

616
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
In the real world that's a bad look

617
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
It doesn't matter

618
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
In the world

619
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
F***** up

620
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
There's no way

621
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
There's no way that's okay

622
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Yep

623
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:31,328
Priorities

624
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
Here's how I he decides to open

625
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
His energy

626
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
Let's let's go over from your sources

627
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,616
Samantha think Auntie comes today Alex

628
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
Publish the story which claimed that I had persuaded the president

629
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
To fire James Comey

630
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
CNN pick that story up

631
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
From

632
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
I would have come

633
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
I am not the source of that story nor have I claimed anything of the kind cuz as I have said

634
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Initial many times

635
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Donald Trump into anything

636
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
Mannequin

637
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Frequency of my conversations with the president

638
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Well I'm not the shy specifically I'm not the source of those confirmed

639
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,016
Joking about calling for

640
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,088
Mr comey's firing now for months

641
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,744
And beyond that the ideas that I somehow persuaded

642
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
True

643
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
She's been calling for Tommy's firing for months

644
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
About

645
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Yes

646
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
How do you have been about as long as the investigation has been public

647
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,360
Oh wow

648
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
He stepped it up quite intensely

649
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Sweets & Stuff

650
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
Calling

651
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Beseech the president through Twitter

652
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,464
Sure maybe personally sit down

653
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
You got to do this

654
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Here's what's funny about that

655
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
So he brought up

656
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
That

657
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
Trump

658
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Says

659
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
Did that story was fake news

660
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Right

661
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Rodger Stone

662
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Between up

663
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
He didn't bring up the last part of between

664
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,480
Where Trump says I haven't talked to Rodger Stone in a long time

665
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,624
Because earlier it is, if you said you talked to him a lot

666
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
And so did Alex Jones

667
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Probably drunk

668
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
You think so

669
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,424
I could I could also see Stone lying about that totally they're both liars they're both

670
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Inveterate liar

671
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Rodger stone is f****** Petty

672
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
He is Trevor Petty you've blown up it's so many people on Twitter

673
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
The tattooed next

674
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Corsi's Petty

675
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:33,344
And I think if Donald Trump really was shutting him out

676
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Gdax against

677
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,952
I don't think that he would still carry water for him

678
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,256
If you wasn't still at least

679
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Being strung along

680
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
Is being on the inside that's my feeling

681
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
So I think that Trump is lying

682
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Episode of damage

683
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Control

684
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Right cuz

685
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,544
Even if you're an idiot present you have to know

686
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
That like

687
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,504
Especially when he is calling for tired and you fired

688
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
To pretend

689
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
And it might not have been all of it probably wasn't my best theory

690
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
Sessions was actively involved in that because

691
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,448
Yes because I believe a lot of things that I read speculation but

692
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,080
Things within a testimony believe that one of the name

693
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Specifically that was on map

694
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Was Jeff

695
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
Otherwise why would he lie

696
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
The reason that most

697
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
People

698
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
I've given in terms of their analysis

699
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
The Clapper testimony

700
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
Is that he was

701
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Denver

702
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
The names you seen on master

703
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,352
Were they Trump Associates or Trump campaign member or members of the

704
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
And he said well both

705
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Yeah

706
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,264
And that's a fun little cuz it could be two different people

707
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
The only person who was both

708
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Jeff sessions

709
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Really

710
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:06,016
Oh that's a good it could be somatic games everybody might as well be under

711
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,344
Everybody in the GOP might as well be like

712
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Target on their back

713
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,304
Has probably spoke to the Russians illegal who are the main players at least publicly

714
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,888
And that you have people like Rodger Stone Paul manafort

715
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Yeah.

716
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,288
Jeff sessions is the only player who has actually been in Congress

717
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Right

718
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,384
That theory is largely hinge

719
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,784
On the idea that Clapper with playing semantics

720
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
That is him kind of

721
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
If that's if that's true

722
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
That's him kind of given one of those like

723
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Hey I can't say it but you know

724
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
Books like

725
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,216
I think it goes without saying you don't want your National Security adviser to be compromised by Russia

726
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,104
That's a way of saying that without saying

727
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
Have to live in the world now

728
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
Somebody out loud says that

729
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
But I think that's why it doesn't go without saying

730
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,464
You had to say it but I think she had to phrase it that way and Frame It That Way in order to not give up the gay

731
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,864
So you say it

732
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
Is the key was compromised

733
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Right I have a

734
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Breached any rules

735
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,568
Goes on

736
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
In this next clip

737
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
He he wants

738
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
To talk a little bit about how

739
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
He's totally cool

740
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
With the firing

741
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,112
Presidents

742
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,976
Call me had no interest in the mega Crimes by the clintons

743
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,584
Foundation is not charity

744
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
It was the vehicle

745
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
Geranium but across-the-board

746
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
Your credibility is shot

747
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
You brought up the uranium

748
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,856
You whatever other things you're going to say it's almost not even worth investigating what those things are

749
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
First example

750
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
You haven't done your research

751
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
So I just

752
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,512
I don't I don't care, I don't have

753
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Research he just doesn't care

754
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,840
It's true cuz it's Thursday

755
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
Clinton boner

756
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,800
Quite frankly

757
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
30 years

758
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
Yeah well it's not just that it is still that

759
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Distract

760
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
From me being under investigation whataboutism

761
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Yeah yeah

762
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Do anything that the Clinton

763
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,648
Didn't do why are you picking on me it's because of my association with

764
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
And if you can

765
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:58,304
Pull that little narrative together Army of all right

766
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Monstrous

767
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Moron

768
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,960
Will f****** go along with it and he's unfairly

769
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,544
Means that it is an illegitimate

770
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,640
As real family

771
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,920
We're seeing indications

772
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
This is the last ditch

773
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,016
Facade is crumbling a little bit

774
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
They're doing these things

775
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Because I need

776
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,368
Right but I

777
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
He goes on to talk about the end

778
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
A little bit

779
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,608
Get mr. call me seem to have no interest in those crimes

780
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,984
Wasting his time investigating be non-existent a Russian collusion

781
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Again

782
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,616
There is no evidence whatsoever that would hold up in a court of law

783
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Well I mean it's fair

784
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Inasmuch as there's not

785
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Publix

786
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
Information that would hold up in a court of law

787
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
Even even

788
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
It is almost

789
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Murder trial what's the

790
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,096
What's the

791
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
What is it

792
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
What's the name of this song

793
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Is so overwhelming

794
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
It's hard to really care about physical evidence

795
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah I mean you can you can get convicted for things without a body

796
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,272
Look at all the rest

797
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,136
That's the reverse

798
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
You just keep repeating

799
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,864
This is nothing

800
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
Call me just as he asked for more funding

801
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
But that's only because

802
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,824
That money was going to be wasted on something we all know

803
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Mitigated

804
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
If

805
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
If

806
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
This narrative had anyway

807
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
Italics in Rogers

808
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Instead of pretending

809
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,256
That firing Comey had something to do with how we handled the Clinton and an email situation

810
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,304
They would have come out and said

811
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
This is b*******

812
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,704
Keep we're firing him because he wants more money for a fake investigation

813
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
It would have been awesome

814
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Give me

815
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,272
We're Republicans were trying to cut down on

816
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
On the budget we're trying to do all this stuff it's overblown he's wasting money Adventure

817
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Easy narrative

818
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
To even get that far

819
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,424
Because then you're admitting that an investigation into yourself is the primary reason

820
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
You have to lie

821
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,336
Talk about what

822
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
Prosecute

823
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Inspiring

824
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Appreciate that

825
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Three times you said the investigation into me wasn't

826
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Unimportant that's like

827
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
F******

828
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Peter stuff like

829
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
Close

830
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
And now you must hang yourself upside down on the cross

831
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,591
I like I like that we know more scripture than Alex Jones The Devout Christian

832
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
So this next clip

833
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
This

834
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Commis real crimes

835
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Again which are the hues

836
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Father and talk

837
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,951
Real talk a little bit more about how you just

838
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Looking weird

839
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
It was that Tommy

840
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,983
Was Violet in the chain of command was seen as Reckless weird

841
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,455
WYD

842
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,527
Attorney General

843
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
Sources said that's one hundred percent

844
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Empire Building

845
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
Responsibilities of the Congress or the executive branch

846
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:28,127
There by 9 so fast

847
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
You noticed that

848
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,295
He said he thought it was a joke when he first heard the news yesterday totally disconnected from reality

849
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
He thought it was a prank is cuz he found out from the television

850
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
Way to get fired when you're the FBI director

851
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
Second thing

852
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
Is there an NFL coach

853
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
There's a reason that they

854
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
Appoint FBI directors for 10-year term

855
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
Is because

856
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
It's supposed to be completely non-political position

857
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,807
He is four years into his term him saying I'm I'm going to be around for another 6 years

858
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
That is how it should have been really f******

859
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Really sucks up

860
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,791
Never going to go to bed for the FBI because they murdered Fred

861
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,447
Forget that the FBI is an evil organization

862
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
Everything

863
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,103
Can to ruin our an arm of the regressive GOP politics

864
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Boat parts

865
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
That is been true for

866
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:41,087
Most of American History too broad a brush that's not all of it

867
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
At the very least hooverwood

868
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
I'm out now.

869
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
GOP hard on Fox

870
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
Saviour nailing why a lot of people who don't believe any of this Russia stuff some of them are pretty reasonable

871
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
People

872
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
Distrust

873
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Comes from

874
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
Why would I ever believed anything intelligent

875
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
To say they all

876
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,639
That's a position I can kind of understand if you're going back

877
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,687
To the FBI and CIA

878
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Their fraught with trouble

879
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,087
Overthrowing regimes in creating Banana Republic

880
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
They did it to us

881
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,767
That's how good we are at make

882
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,351
Banana Republic is accident

883
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
Maybe. Who knows maybe the globalists are actually the anticipated

884
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Doesn't exist

885
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,127
Not in the way that I think paranoid people believe

886
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
No I'm not there but there

887
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
There's there's

888
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Underground deep state

889
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,831
I don't I think it's hard to imagine that there isn't something

890
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,487
This podcast going to turn into you and me turning into the lone gunmen what's going on

891
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
6 f****** months ago

892
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
I don't know

893
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Every every

894
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
Every single thing I thought about

895
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
I thought I knew about American

896
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Politics

897
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
Civics the way Ark

898
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
The tution work

899
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
All of this stuff is gone

900
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,111
I'm against this idea that you're saying about this Underground

901
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,391
Deep State and what-have-you

902
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
Is Batumi that

903
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Azizi an excuse as globalist

904
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
The glove box dealership

905
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
All of this.

906
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
If they were a secret underground

907
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
Football

908
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
People are that comp

909
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Sure

910
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
Especially people that

911
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
All the people we have in government now

912
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
Some of the most incompetent people

913
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
And it's all across the board

914
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,391
How how is it that the Democratic Party

915
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
Could not get themselves elected

916
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,071
It has to be a view if you read the the Hillary book

917
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
The new one out

918
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
I can't remember the name of it but it is

919
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
It is basically just

920
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,335
Trees of interviews from the Hillary

921
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,151
Going over out in comp

922
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
It was at every step

923
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Outlook

924
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
I'll be

925
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
Obviously

926
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
They were dumb

927
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
To think

928
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
We've got this

929
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,255
I were her I would too

930
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
You have to be like

931
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Particular

932
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,679
Right before she didn't go as hard in the paint is

933
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Cuz you needed to

934
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,007
But then there were things remind me better

935
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,103
There were things that went against we're outside of her

936
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Control

937
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
Cecconi's letter

938
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Such as

939
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Alex Jones

940
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,551
You know but if you can't

941
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
20 points

942
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:00,255
You at home probably probably couldn't have if it wasn't Trump and brexit

943
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
That's probably

944
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,815
The only reason

945
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
France was saved by our fall

946
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
Chiron

947
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,311
Still in the middle of racketeering they will be destroyed by our fall is

948
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,895
A big Title Wave

949
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
This business class

950
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
I've just given a poetic title

951
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
This one

952
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
It's called The Stone.

953
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
That's too much

954
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,487
Nothing to do with heading off a Russian investigation

955
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,351
Senators Warner Feinstein's Franken Congressman Schiff

956
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
Fire heimbach nothing Alex

957
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
Nothing they're holding it in their hand they got nothing

958
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Bogus

959
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,919
Humiliated if they continue down this path

960
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
We'll see

961
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
You know

962
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
It's there's nothing

963
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
It's bogus

964
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
They just keep this gun

965
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
What they should do is just

966
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,887
That's basically

967
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:16,287
It's basically what he's getting at getting trouble

968
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
Give it up it's like it snow today is it supposed herblock

969
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Exactly

970
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
Exactly

971
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Kind of action

972
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,623
S*** where do you know

973
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
I have been communicating

974
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
With reptiles

975
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
Oh no they have been watching

976
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Oh no

977
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Just give it up

978
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
In the same way that Alex Jones

979
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,823
Whenever one of his ex-employees comes out and says some s*** about him anonymously he knows that they can't publicly

980
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,383
Please say anything about it cuz I found potentiality

981
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,223
Or in the same way that Rodger Stone can lie about being poisoned by polonium

982
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
His doctors can't correct it

983
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
The doctors can't correct it

984
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:09,023
You can make those eyes in the same way that he can say they don't have any evidence because they legally can't

985
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,375
You can trick people Intel that evidences be classified

986
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Well and that's

987
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
That's another reason why

988
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
Stone

989
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
About

990
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
Because it wouldn't matter either way Trump has

991
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
To deny it

992
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
So you can say he's talk

993
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
However much

994
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Even if he is

995
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
He still has to say the same thing

996
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Why

997
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,743
Because if you are talkin the Trump on your Rodger Stone and Trump says

998
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
I talked to my buddy

999
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
Rodger Stone

1000
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
That is basically

1001
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Saying I'm

1002
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
Implicit in whatever it is Rodger Stone

1003
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
What is it that you have

1004
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
Just say no

1005
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
Could you talk

1006
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,431
Rodger Stone after he fired Flynn he was talking about how he's a good man

1007
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Great man

1008
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,063
Didn't do anything wrong sad to see him go but he accidentally lied to the VP

1009
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Go let him go he's a good man

1010
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,255
About all the stuff

1011
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Evite daughter

1012
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Wait

1013
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
He might not have liked

1014
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,239
Absolutely

1015
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:31,199
Yeah this is murder on the Orient Express

1016
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
We're getting

1017
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
To hear maybe we should take a step back

1018
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,439
Alex would like us to look at the big picture

1019
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,231
I think she is the person

1020
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Guide

1021
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,119
Rodger in a 5 minutes we've got left here I want to

1022
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
Look at the big picture I'm completely made up

1023
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:04,223
Trump

1024
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,527
Business magnate

1025
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Nope

1026
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
Untrue

1027
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,999
Degrees fact that he's just being so blase about

1028
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
What is true

1029
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,839
The Democrats and the Republicans

1030
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,935
I've been involved with tomatillo outside business ventures

1031
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
Betsy

1032
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,751
That's bad on its own

1033
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:31,615
Everything else was normal that would be something

1034
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
I am slightly blase on that

1035
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Quite Frank

1036
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
It's almost

1037
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
But

1038
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,575
Being involved with Russian mobsters

1039
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,159
And getting tons of money from weird Shady

1040
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,487
That deals with people with

1041
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
Checkered Russian pass

1042
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Like that

1043
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Not

1044
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Nothing

1045
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
You know what I mean

1046
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,007
Most of his money is Lent to him by a Russia connected Bank

1047
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
You know that

1048
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
Like how

1049
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,943
Another way

1050
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
He's quoted by somebody else but

1051
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
Spiritually it matches up with

1052
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
Madhavi

1053
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,671
Investigations have been done into

1054
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Trump Finance

1055
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
Lending comes from Russian sources

1056
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
Even if it isn't poop

1057
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
Even if it isn't political

1058
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Bulshit

1059
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
Absolute b******* also

1060
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,823
The main reason I stopped this clip

1061
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
The wanted to warn you

1062
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
That's going to be really f***** up

1063
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
I want to give you a heads-up

1064
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
The time

1065
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
I'm the middle

1066
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,831
Okay have a sip of wine and

1067
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,743
And then towards the end Alex

1068
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
Cannot let Rodger talk and it's

1069
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
Delightful

1070
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,519
War with us

1071
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,311
They're fighting the cop killing gross

1072
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,127
Their funding all the Social Distortion garbage

1073
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,175
Danger

1074
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
Country

1075
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:31,935
Constitutional

1076
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:38,591
And I told you I told you I told you I was sipping wine

1077
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,615
I told you

1078
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,687
Happening right now

1079
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
Yeah like that's crazy

1080
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,111
Is that at this clip isn't done this is merely.

1081
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
Nothing means anything

1082
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,167
It's not a Thor attarian ism

1083
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,543
It's insanely disconnecting the inability to see what he's saying

1084
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
Like the lack

1085
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,663
Of of of self-reflection in his words are are

1086
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Are shocking

1087
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,247
I think it's because you super hungover

1088
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
Right there

1089
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
Along with all his boxes

1090
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,183
Oh great

1091
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Eel

1092
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:43,103
Or or City

1093
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:50,783
Watergate and they used it to undo one of the greatest political landslide in American history

1094
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
Defending watered watered

1095
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,447
Who's the Republican the Republicans turned on Nixon because they were going to

1096
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
To get voted out

1097
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Hannah

1098
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,823
So so this is

1099
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,407
Republicans obstructionist about impeach

1100
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,247
And that's when they turned on it

1101
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
End up having

1102
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
Yeah I don't think I don't think

1103
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
At this point

1104
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,767
They wouldn't possibly believe that they're not

1105
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,863
So now here's the other here's the other hope there though

1106
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Just like

1107
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Beatbox

1108
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Talking right now

1109
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
Pretending all of this s*** way

1110
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
Was true and just rewriting history

1111
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
Rewriting

1112
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
The present in order to

1113
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
Fit their narrative

1114
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Entirely

1115
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Possible that

1116
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
These

1117
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,759
True Believers in Congress

1118
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Think

1119
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
Their connections

1120
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,159
I'm so they are immune to being voted out

1121
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,439
They can't possibly

1122
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
Simply accept

1123
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
That the

1124
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,023
People who have that there are people

1125
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
Who have voted Republican in the past

1126
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Who will turn against them

1127
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
There's a lot of stuff whether or not they're wrong is a whole different world

1128
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
Republican

1129
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
That it would be incredibly difficult

1130
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
How to get somebody out

1131
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,735
But even if you have two primary them cuz it would be another Republican trying to

1132
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,039
To take their seats as an incompetent

1133
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,087
And that's such a hassle that most people wouldn't

1134
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
Do it

1135
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
I don't know

1136
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
I don't I don't know

1137
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
The fact that they're sitting here and

1138
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
Let me be clear

1139
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,007
I forgot that part of this clip was that Rodger Stone tries to rewrite White

1140
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,567
Crazy

1141
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,663
The rest of this is even crazy

1142
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
There's two minutes

1143
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Frites

1144
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
Win at The Ballot Box

1145
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
A true of this extra

1146
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Is brother

1147
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
Hillary Clinton

1148
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
Chelsea Clinton

1149
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
They should be compelled to testify

1150
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,527
Conjecture it's not a conspiracy theory

1151
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
Cold hard facts

1152
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:44,351
Yeah it's time to get her out of the White House

1153
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:09,695
Grand jury

1154
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:14,559
Many many many

1155
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Email

1156
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
They're coming after America with everything

1157
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,063
I swear to God I didn't edit that at all

1158
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,695
Twice within a minute interrupt a sorry go ahead and then immediately starts

1159
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,023
That that is a man

1160
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
Who is like

1161
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Insane

1162
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,911
These roots spread

1163
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,263
I don't know

1164
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,079
I mean within the context of

1165
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,871
So if if you can

1166
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
If you can say

1167
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
Kian rogerstone Haddon

1168
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
An hour Converse

1169
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Yeah

1170
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
I can't believe that

1171
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
He really talks

1172
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
Pastor Rodger the same way off

1173
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,767
Probably not so if you can perform

1174
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
We talk to each other about the same

1175
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,839
Off Arizona

1176
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,119
Just know Mike

1177
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
Maybe more yelling

1178
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,823
Imagine that on air

1179
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
It's part of the dynamic

1180
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,175
When Alex

1181
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,967
Turn it is ratcheting it up

1182
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,575
Because it would show it doesn't matter it is still a performance Stevens

1183
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,367
Having listened

1184
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
True black 5-month

1185
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Straight

1186
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,975
And I'm dipping back into the archives

1187
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
I have

1188
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,583
Thorough investigation I'm engaged in right now.

1189
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,863
Look

1190
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
I I can't I can't review it yet

1191
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,775
But I'm onto something really big

1192
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Doona

1193
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
Do not ask Trump for more

1194
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,663
Resources

1195
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,479
Nextstep fired from the podcast

1196
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,343
My cat takes over Giuliani

1197
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
Like even even having listened to

1198
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Hours of

1199
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
H & H

1200
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,095
But you guys listening have no f****** idea how much I've listened to this dumbass

1201
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,143
I've never heard him

1202
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,423
Interrupt

1203
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
Like

1204
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,799
But the comedy of

1205
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,663
Bahrain

1206
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,927
Just remember the phrase I guess

1207
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,511
A ton of

1208
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,583
Rodger Stone interview

1209
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
Because

1210
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,375
I mean solved

1211
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
More less

1212
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,191
There's not a ton

1213
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:04,287
More I can't remember if you still on this next or if he's already left

1214
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
But

1215
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
Rodger Stone

1216
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:13,759
That notorious March 30th episode

1217
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,319
Rodger Stone was around for a little while than Alex

1218
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:22,719
Drunkenly deteriorated into a man talk about selling his car in the ways you learn

1219
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
Beautiful episode

1220
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:28,351
Go back one more time.

1221
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:34,239
Just near the end where Alex gets super introspective refuses to look at

1222
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
There's a little bit of that energy

1223
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
Rodger Stone ends up leaving

1224
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
And things go a little weird

1225
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
They got a little bit weird we'll get to it

1226
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Butts

1227
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Expresso glass

1228
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,599
Vetta, he's got more about Hillary's crime

1229
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,839
This this this this really makes me feel good about President Trump

1230
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
In that team has fire Towing

1231
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:10,335
Tell me the stood there while Loretta Lynch met on airplanes to put Bill Clinton break the law while he's under criminal investigation

1232
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,991
Lance Rashad there with all the Wikileaks info coming on or they were coordinating with the White House on the cover-up crimes

1233
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,647
Iranian deal Sriracha the shell / Technologies China

1234
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,487
Still not the clintons have been protected by the FBI for decades

1235
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,303
Highest level cinematronics

1236
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
And then all the Wikileaks pedophile information

1237
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,751
Police Department 12 release with vfd I basically shutdown

1238
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,639
So you can see you there that like his one example is that Loretta Lynch was on a plane with Bill Clinton

1239
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:49,247
Yeah that's what he keeps doing all that much

1240
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
Uranium deal brought up again

1241
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,599
He says that

1242
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Installing our technology to China

1243
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:02,303
When I was researching the uranium deal

1244
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,655
What it boils down to is that Hillary Clinton because she was Secretary of State

1245
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,727
Heads of departments like all the secretaries

1246
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,007
Centrally in the

1247
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
The cabinets

1248
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,895
Are part of a nine-member organization called the Council on Foreign investment in the United States

1249
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:22,271
Anytime a foreign company tries to buy something that may or may not be relevant to our national security

1250
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
Play that I don't know

1251
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Sofia

1252
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Beginning of a word

1253
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Spears

1254
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,047
But you're really good idea

1255
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,095
This organization when

1256
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,191
This uranium company was being bought out by a Russian company

1257
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,519
Something that got reviewed by

1258
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Cuz it is

1259
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,431
And Hillary Clinton have any personal

1260
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,991
I involvement in the outcome of the ocean

1261
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
She couldn't have a suede

1262
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Decision

1263
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
And

1264
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,135
The outcome of the Sofia

1265
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
Is it they make a recommendation

1266
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
And then the president can let the deal go through or

1267
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
He can put the kibosh on the

1268
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,863
Gotcha they don't choose what happened

1269
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
So even if she had said

1270
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
Don't let this go through

1271
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:18,591
If it's not her choice to make so the idea that you sold this is number one factually inaccurate

1272
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
I meant logistically enact

1273
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,455
While I was doing the research into that uranium deal

1274
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
One of the interesting things that I found out

1275
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Was it a 2016

1276
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
Barack Obama did

1277
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Stop company

1278
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,439
From being bought because you felt it was relevant to our national interest

1279
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,279
Really it had to do with a recommendation that the city is it made

1280
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
It was

1281
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,863
Involving a Chinese company

1282
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,167
From buying a Dutch company that produced microchip

1283
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
Out of concern that they were doing so for nefarious reasons

1284
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,543
I don't have too much of the microchip Market

1285
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
So Alex

1286
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,431
Sayings that are way too interested

1287
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,319
I am giving examples from a year ago of Barak Obama

1288
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,599
Stepping into being like

1289
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,671
Well we've got to be careful about the Chinese consolidation.

1290
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Technology

1291
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
So-so

1292
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
Literally

1293
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,327
Not literally meaning figuratively

1294
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
Literally

1295
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887
The Liberals

1296
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
He is decrying

1297
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,959
For doing nothing

1298
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,591
Witchy ostensibly

1299
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,919
Article in the New Yorker New York Times

1300
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
From February 4th twenty

1301
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
16 that I've linked up in

1302
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
That article about

1303
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
The uranium deal

1304
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
You can find all the resources there

1305
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,207
It's fully documented absolutely concrete example against

1306
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,119
All of that stuff about the WikiLeaks

1307
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
This means he's never read it

1308
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
Because those things aren't in there

1309
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Why does he

1310
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
If he brings up

1311
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
The pedophilia thingy

1312
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
He is repped

1313
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,735
WikiLeaks

1314
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:07,135
We weren't talking about Comet Ping Pong

1315
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,303
You're adding adjective misrepresenting

1316
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
The actual Wikileaks say

1317
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
Retro you haven't read

1318
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,935
Someone has told you it's all secondhand

1319
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
Wright Tire description

1320
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Again

1321
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,823
I don't think Hillary is the best person in the world

1322
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,359
She's complicit in some s***

1323
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
But at the same time all of the examples

1324
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Auntie wants

1325
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
And either lies

1326
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Or just things he doesn't actually understand

1327
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
It's embarrassing

1328
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
Is absolutely embarrassing

1329
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:42,207
It would be if anybody but us was

1330
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
Capable of giving a s*** I guess so everyone who cares is already written off Alex

1331
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,727
He's lying and it doesn't matter

1332
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,567
But thank you to everyone who actually enjoys herself

1333
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,639
I didn't even get

1334
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
Once we get

1335
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Enough listen

1336
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Say

1337
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
45 million listeners

1338
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
That's common

1339
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:13,695
That's that's right around the corner with a with all the new policy

1340
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,863
45 million people are about to be on important stuff

1341
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
First

1342
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
For now

1343
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,151
IQ

1344
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
What pimp yogurt

1345
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,831
So this next flight

1346
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
It's thicker

1347
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,135
Then regular gas

1348
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,719
It's thicker than the lies coming out of his mouth

1349
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Flip the yogurt

1350
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:54,143
The next web I've done some research into it's going to be interesting when we come out the other side of

1351
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,983
Is restoring our military

1352
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,543
Restoring our economy

1353
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Give Russia was our enemy

1354
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,407
Russia was controlling

1355
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
President-trump

1356
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
They would not be doing any of that

1357
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:15,647
The first Russian

1358
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,535
Call Trevor Thousand Years

1359
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,071
Martin systems

1360
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,679
There's more cold

1361
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,239
Natural gas oil you-name-it can buy

1362
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,335
That can't be true

1363
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:39,711
Gas prices in Russia plunge Russia's main export

1364
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
That's actually not a bad argue

1365
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,951
Wasn't to hurt Russia instahealthy I say sorry

1366
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
So

1367
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,839
Here's why it is a terrible argument I don't know

1368
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,887
From Frozen

1369
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,287
Why would you support a thing that goes against Russia's thing if the premises were true

1370
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,079
The argument would be good

1371
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:11,967
So are either premises true exactly how much

1372
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,271
Azure Natural Gas

1373
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,087
Most of the numbers that you can find or speculative

1374
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:22,719
There are bunch of reserves and other stuff we know about but there's unknown unknown

1375
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
Reservoir

1376
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
Oars we might find later

1377
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,351
We don't know

1378
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
Call Crystal

1379
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,679
Absolutely

1380
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Is the Clean Coal is b*******

1381
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:41,919
Absolute on the show and I realize I'm getting a little self-conscious

1382
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,735
So it's time to fully leave that out

1383
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:49,087
Call is Alex what is excellent with your abs

1384
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Document

1385
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Sing facts

1386
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,207
Another kind of coal which is

1387
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
Observe

1388
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,887
The only way that you could rats be rationalized Cole is colditz prison

1389
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
Differently

1390
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
You do different things with it

1391
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
And that makes it clean

1392
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,847
The biggest version of isn't the only one that's really relevant to any national conversation

1393
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,151
Is the idea of carbon capture

1394
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,479
Technology you're aware of this but so those

1395
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,527
It's a technology that's design

1396
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,855
Collect and dispose of coal plants carbon dioxide emission

1397
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,207
Before they escape into the atmosphere because once they get into the atmosphere

1398
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
Can cause warming

1399
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,255
And if

1400
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
So

1401
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,839
According to this article in Bloomberg

1402
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,959
Technology may be on the drawing board demonstration

1403
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,055
But it's not close to being ready for widespread use at an affordable price

1404
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
No

1405
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,175
The one u.s. plant that being designed to use carbon capture

1406
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
Construction in Kemper County Mississippi

1407
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,807
His two years behind schedule and four billion dollars over budget

1408
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Wow

1409
01:11:54,111 --> 01:12:00,255
A similar heavily subsidized project in Saskatchewan

1410
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:04,095
Cost upwards of 17 trillion dollars

1411
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,239
Survey

1412
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:15,103
Have worked someone all that well yet

1413
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
But at the same time

1414
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:25,599
Trillion-dollar number of outfitting all of our coal-burning plants

1415
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
Is Chewie higher

1416
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:34,047
Then all sorts of renewable resources that we use

1417
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,631
Well we got to save like 50 coal miners ball bats the other

1418
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
They're not coming back

1419
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
Mechanism

1420
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Cleco

1421
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:49,151
If you look at the number of jobs that were lost because of the coal industry going down it's not me

1422
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,943
Nearly as many jobs as just because of automation

1423
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,295
And that's just a reality that's going to be on the table

1424
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,927
How is if you look at the number of like

1425
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,231
Tourism and Retail related jobs

1426
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,047
That have been lost since Trump got in office compared to

1427
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,351
The hypothetical games of the coal industry

1428
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Close enough

1429
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,215
Root Looper retail and tourism jobs

1430
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,007
Cuz people just cuz people don't want to f***

1431
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,031
Come here

1432
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
Hell if I do

1433
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Absolutely

1434
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,943
So you remember all those you remember

1435
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
When people used to say well

1436
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,039
I mean it's not working in a coal mine

1437
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,111
Yeah

1438
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,927
You could die if that can marry

1439
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Subsidizing

1440
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,447
Started subsidizing renewable energy

1441
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Hijab

1442
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
Those jobs those people who were work

1443
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
Coal mine

1444
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,847
Yeah probably work in a

1445
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,919
Solar Farms

1446
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Murdered by

1447
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
F****** mind

1448
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,879
Now there's a lot of issues they do end up killing a lot of birds

1449
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,183
They're not ideal and a lot of ways

1450
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:09,535
Canary in the Wind Farm probably doesn't

1451
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,423
SolarCity, getting fired is the canary in the Wind Farm

1452
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,703
What's up

1453
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,495
That's not bad

1454
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Thank you

1455
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
Sorry

1456
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,615
To the argument

1457
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,223
He's making the argument as soon as Trump said Cole is back on the table

1458
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:28,991
Russian gas

1459
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:29,759
Gas prices

1460
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
Did that happen

1461
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,111
Wow I'm looking at a official graph

1462
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
The price

1463
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,487
Gasoline per liter

1464
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
In Russia

1465
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
Anil January 30th it was at 38

1466
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
4 rubles

1467
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Per liter

1468
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,983
38.4 that's right around when Trump was inaugurated

1469
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,823
Would you like to know what it was on the 8th of May 27th

1470
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
I sure would

1471
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,151
39.29

1472
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
Nope it was

1473
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
It went

1474
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,551
I don't know how

1475
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,367
Where the more you have the less money

1476
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,183
It has never gone down

1477
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
Sent

1478
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
Trump Sargon

1479
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,535
The price of gas

1480
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,583
Has just consistently gone up

1481
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
Is nothing

1482
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,959
True know nothing history

1483
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,519
Do you know what the thing that's kind of interesting is that

1484
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,543
Price of gas

1485
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,103
Is trending or has trended downward send

1486
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,639
Give or take

1487
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,967
7:40

1488
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,295
Suppose it's going down

1489
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
And then OPAC

1490
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
Is limiting their

1491
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,903
In order to artificial

1492
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:43,231
Keep it up possibly created

1493
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
Like mid-2014 or so

1494
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
Brett but

1495
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
Cuz we're all going to die

1496
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,727
Price of Russian gas has gone up

1497
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:03,711
Plus it just made that up

1498
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:10,111
In the same way that you said it's a good argument if you don't look for numbers

1499
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,463
I mean the fact that

1500
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,023
You know all the other good stuff though

1501
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
Cities done

1502
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Sriracha

1503
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Is still there

1504
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,911
Maybe they even

1505
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Maybe they'd be willing to take that

1506
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
Trade-off

1507
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,335
Yeah we'll give you some coal jobs in order for us to have

1508
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,991
Who knows if possible

1509
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,111
Sure I told you that I like without Rodger Stone in toe things kind of

1510
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,695
Spiraled a little bit in the last two clips

1511
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
She's made arguments that are based on any reality

1512
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
I feel good

1513
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,583
He's going to feel good

1514
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
Because

1515
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
This should be the day of Celebration

1516
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,447
This guy has gone down

1517
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,335
He was the FBI director was a compromise global

1518
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,895
Liquor

1519
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,943
You still gotta hit his greatest hits

1520
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
Completely narratives

1521
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,319
It gets so weird

1522
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,415
Okay this is f***** up

1523
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,511
I have seen people do for being totally enthusiastic about Trump

1524
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,327
100 100

1525
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
11 days in

1526
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,191
Really been disillusioned with President Trump

1527
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
Yeah

1528
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,031
1 belt

1529
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:37,151
Is that we were selling probably 500 Trump Pence

1530
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
Sideways for that bad health care bill

1531
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
To be honest

1532
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,791
Really good Bellwether for

1533
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
Whether or not his listeners

1534
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,863
Are sticking on board with

1535
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,263
Infowarsstore.com Trump Pence 2020 shirts

1536
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:08,383
Retail for $20 1995 are on sale for 495

1537
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,759
And have been pretty consistent

1538
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Canobie

1539
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
Covering cost

1540
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,391
So now

1541
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,023
Baby cuz the bellwether

1542
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Is this a the dumbest thing you

1543
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,959
Punchline for his acts from 10 years ago

1544
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Until I sell all the

1545
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Or whatever

1546
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Pretty crazy

1547
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
Like in terms of quantum

1548
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
What

1549
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,879
10 grand

1550
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,951
Yeah but everyday

1551
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,559
Two and a half gram. Less than 200

1552
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,119
Eliza cuts into your profit

1553
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,959
I'm out of work you probably have to do to pimple that product

1554
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,287
$2,500 a day if we were getting it

1555
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
Yeah but the shipping Department

1556
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,407
And makeup

1557
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,455
Taking a bath

1558
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:23,135
I mean for 2,500 though I feel like I would have no problem if it was you and

1559
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,719
Recording the show for 3 hours every day and then the rest of the day

1560
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:30,047
F****** folding shirts

1561
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
We're also

1562
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:41,567
What would you do

1563
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
What up

1564
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,551
Just sign knowledge Elder ghost

1565
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,647
If we ever do get to a point where we can make this a job

1566
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
I will buy

1567
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Supplement

1568
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
And do a Supersize Me thing

1569
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,839
I will do like a I'll go to a doctor and

1570
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:08,447
Use myself as a guinea pig taking super male vitality

1571
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,751
I don't know if I can handle you with much more hair

1572
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
Is a function of the product I'll pluck

1573
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
Turn into Cousin It

1574
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,808
The shirts are a symbol of disillusioned

1575
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
495 fresh air

1576
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,440
Much less

1577
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
Too bad

1578
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Thought

1579
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
That is a really good bellwether

1580
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,960
Well he does if people are super male vitality

1581
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,496
That means they still buying

1582
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,056
If they aren't buying those shirts

1583
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,872
Maybe they're still on the the Trump bandwagon

1584
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,664
But they do not want to be advertised

1585
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,296
That's a fair point that's even though

1586
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:59,392
The argument that Trump Pence 2020 shirts have their own life

1587
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
They don't really

1588
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,768
Hillary for Clinton Hillary for prison shirts do have their own life

1589
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
They have their own thing

1590
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,584
Because they just can't suck

1591
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
Can let that go

1592
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,984
He he he gets into this and then he's at the end there he's like

1593
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
You know that Alterra bill that went sideways

1594
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,360
Starts talking about Julian Assange

1595
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,712
You shouldn't be prosecuted if it just goes on for a bit of like

1596
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
His greatest hits

1597
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,576
So the things he doesn't like about Trump goes three examples

1598
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,696
It's something that I think you and I are going to be really offended by

1599
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
And

1600
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,512
We don't want to end up like that sucks

1601
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,328
He's talking about Mexico and however

1602
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:44,448
Everyone gets shot their man

1603
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,520
Not great but not how like

1604
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
So much violence

1605
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
Drug wars

1606
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,920
And stuff like that you do don't want to be like my old on

1607
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
Listen

1608
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,552
I thought you saw the Twitch in my eye

1609
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,368
But because we have such a demand for jobs

1610
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
That's the drug war for you

1611
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,208
Stop it

1612
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,232
Play Chicago

1613
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,072
The only place in this hemisphere more dangerous than Mexico City

1614
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
Not true

1615
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
Chicago

1616
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,032
Dot-com

1617
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,896
I have two people who live in Chicago people are coming to Chicago then our leave

1618
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:30,784
Also I don't know if there's a hemisphere shift

1619
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
Within the United States

1620
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,392
Hemispheres

1621
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,416
It's right so you got

1622
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Mexico and 1/2

1623
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,792
Chicago central hemisphere

1624
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,864
That's your northern hemisphere

1625
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,936
South America that's your Southern

1626
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,008
Hemisphere

1627
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Then you got Australia which

1628
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,848
Coincidentally

1629
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
Is also

1630
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,200
Part of the South American Hemet

1631
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,016
You understand Linguistics Hemi means half anyway

1632
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,600
The United States is all in the same hemisphere

1633
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:13,024
It goes without saying that you don't want your National Security advisor

1634
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
In terms

1635
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Murder rate

1636
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Yes

1637
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,704
Chicago is eight

1638
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,240
The United States

1639
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,360
After St Louis

1640
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,920
Murder rate

1641
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,968
This is like / 100,000

1642
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,528
For whatever it's not

1643
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:40,928
Total number of murders play the numbers

1644
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:47,328
Incredibly high and it is

1645
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
59.3

1646
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:54,752
Number two number three number for New Orleans Cleveland number 6

1647
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
Newark

1648
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,312
Number 7 Memphis then

1649
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
So

1650
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
Or New Jersey

1651
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
Orange chicken

1652
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,320
Chicago's are City how about you go fuc yourself

1653
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,112
Especially

1654
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
Come right with facts

1655
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,952
Like if you want to say that the murder rate is

1656
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
Too high

1657
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:21,376
With great conversation most dangerous city outside of Mexico

1658
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:28,032
Most dangerous city in Mexico

1659
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,312
Those places are

1660
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
So scary

1661
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:37,760
Constant conflict between law enforcement the multiple cartel sitting around

1662
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:41,856
How to get around at Elana Juarez

1663
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
No

1664
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
The f****** bodies

1665
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Hung from

1666
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,072
Intercept like web Highway

1667
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,632
I miss that when I was there

1668
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:59,008
Jesus go f*** himself

1669
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,336
But then he gets back to a topic he was touching on a little bit earlier

1670
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,128
It's more thoughts about it

1671
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
The bellwether

1672
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
Sideways

1673
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,488
They're also selling a

1674
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:26,400
Boobies

1675
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:32,800
Weather weather

1676
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,384
Global corporate crony capitalism

1677
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,712
Is a nightmare sister the trump supposing it

1678
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,624
They also sell a sundial so far

1679
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,672
But like new here

1680
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,000
If you don't see the Trump is secretly doing great

1681
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,144
I'm ready to see the truth

1682
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
Your facts are there

1683
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
Alex

1684
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
Obviously

1685
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,848
That's not what

1686
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,224
I mean in all honesty if you are if you listen to this podcast

1687
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
What you know Alex Jones is

1688
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Constantly

1689
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,624
Always putting together a false nail

1690
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,672
I think

1691
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,952
Today what I'm

1692
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
Is he is not

1693
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Lying

1694
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,560
He is creating a

1695
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,096
Alterna

1696
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Universe

1697
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:34,752
It's an alternate universe has already existed

1698
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:38,080
Well with all that globalist narrative universe

1699
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
Yeah but I mean

1700
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
We're talking

1701
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,688
Parallel universe like

1702
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
Futurama Style

1703
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,808
Flip of the coin kind of situation

1704
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,088
Because it is

1705
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
Direct

1706
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
It's Direct

1707
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
121

1708
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
This is true

1709
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,744
So I'm going to say the Opera

1710
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,304
Cross everything

1711
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
Trump is being investigated

1712
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,144
So I'm going to say that Hillary

1713
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,192
What it should be

1714
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,408
Trump is becoming an authoritarian

1715
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
So I'm going to say

1716
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
The Democrats are trying to become a

1717
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
Authoritarian

1718
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,416
That it is

1719
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,232
Whole constant

1720
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
You're wrong

1721
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,816
Every single listener

1722
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:37,216
I think so because

1723
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:43,616
Beyond today I might as well get a tattoo of Hillary's face

1724
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:50,016
The reason I think you're wrong is because the pain

1725
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,552
Parallel universe theory

1726
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,088
What are you saying

1727
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Is

1728
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,648
It's fanciful

1729
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,672
In Subway

1730
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,024
He's still trying to steal people who live within this universe

1731
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
I don't know if I'm making to find it

1732
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Distinction

1733
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
What I say

1734
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
Because like

1735
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:12,544
Just because he's lying about what's going on

1736
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
You might be right

1737
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:21,248
There's a point that there's a point I want to make but I'm not sure it is

1738
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
8tracks

1739
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
It's not that it doesn't

1740
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:28,672
Amtrak is I'm not sure how to articulate it and I'm not sure it's that much different than what you're saying

1741
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,512
I think you're you're wrong when you say he's trying to convince people who still living

1742
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
But it is

1743
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,328
It is driving

1744
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
People towards

1745
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
It's

1746
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:44,032
A priming people for the argument

1747
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
This is

1748
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
Sweet

1749
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:52,736
This is not we're picking on one thing and were using it

1750
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:57,088
I know but it just seems it just seems

1751
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Adjusting

1752
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,184
Seems like he is completely divorced

1753
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:07,584
Completely divorced from the reality we live in put any

1754
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,608
Semblance of

1755
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:11,680
Cuz you know what probably happened to that hour-long conversation with Rodger Stone

1756
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:16,032
This is bit going down

1757
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,872
Might as well ramp it up to eleven my sources tell me that were fun

1758
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,456
Something like I mean there has to be some awareness bit like

1759
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
You can't

1760
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,296
Fire the director of the FBI MIT invest

1761
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,088
Navigation and think nothing is

1762
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,112
Going to happen

1763
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:33,696
I think there is a 12

1764
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,768
They were surprised by the backlash.

1765
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,328
Who is Alex

1766
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
Sure

1767
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
Little smart is a little smart

1768
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,192
Everybody in the GOP it

1769
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:47,008
Every single human being

1770
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,800
Who says I am a Republican

1771
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,360
And I support Republican candidates

1772
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Is

1773
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,152
Stupid

1774
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
I agree

1775
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:58,272
Does that mean everybody who says they support Democrats is smart

1776
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,064
F*** no

1777
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
But it's not

1778
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,392
100%

1779
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:09,024
We are not beholden to any party at my point being with the complete

1780
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,560
Utterly different

1781
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
I think he

1782
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,888
He's priming people for

1783
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
The

1784
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
To have with somebody who's not

1785
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,752
Oh yeah it is always

1786
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
Like okay

1787
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,872
And and this is what he's doing basically by creating this parallel

1788
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
They say this

1789
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:29,248
Yeah so you say instead of engaging with that

1790
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
Me and the feeling Jordan Tyler Snodgrass little conversation

1791
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
On the show

1792
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,792
Was his expensive it was

1793
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
This is teaching you to argue with

1794
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,168
This is giving you lines to say

1795
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
What about this

1796
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,728
What about Mike

1797
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,032
In order to divert from the main point

1798
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,848
I would have known that but I fast forward every time

1799
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:01,248
Replacement Jordans talk I just only listen to you what are numbers back that up

1800
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,576
You're not on the show

1801
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,112
Well it I've learned my lesson

1802
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:14,304
That's not a hundred percent true but I just want to stroke your ego a little bit

1803
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,376
Listen every time you're not on Russian gas prices

1804
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,704
Can I quit the show

1805
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,520
From this point forward

1806
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
Through the rest of the clips we have

1807
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,128
There's two pole

1808
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Alex Jones is

1809
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,688
Fluctuating between

1810
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
What time is it

1811
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,552
And the other is

1812
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
Not really

1813
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:48,096
There is a tiny bit of overlap mostly rambling

1814
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,632
Next clip that I'm going to

1815
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,424
The play is about the globalist

1816
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216
It's about

1817
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,240
Like

1818
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
The power structure I think

1819
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,824
But I have specifically

1820
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,896
It like the dude WAV file

1821
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
That I have your mp3

1822
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
Is titled

1823
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,736
Doesn't make sense

1824
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:13,952
I forgot what was in the clip

1825
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,560
Just like that and that applies fully remember what's in it

1826
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
This is this is a mic down situation

1827
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,192
Cuz I think we need to park

1828
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:29,056
I want to let this clip play and then when we get back I really want it

1829
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:33,152
If you have any idea what he's

1830
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,736
Yeah yeah yeah like you're studying for a goddamn midterm

1831
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,064
A lot done that's good

1832
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,696
That's why I'm supporting this is so good

1833
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:54,912
Republican leadership

1834
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,960
Country Club

1835
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
People

1836
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,032
X-Men

1837
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
To play ball

1838
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,152
2030 yearsley to get into Congress

1839
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,248
In the Senate

1840
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,344
They are so scared to death

1841
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,464
Mainstream media's Asic bilmar School static Stephen Colbert's really cool

1842
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:26,912
Fox

1843
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,960
To be on those shows playing along with all that

1844
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:35,360
Rotting decay

1845
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,816
Facade

1846
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,192
50 years in this country

1847
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,872
Pre-market

1848
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:16,576
Like real competition

1849
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:21,184
Bose system

1850
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Feudalism

1851
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,256
So that's the clip

1852
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,560
I saw you scribbling

1853
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,864
I love

1854
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,936
Look I know that it's about

1855
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,008
Big picture that's about the globalist

1856
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,104
But the way those thoughts connected does not mix

1857
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Okay

1858
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Call me good

1859
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,504
Call me firing good

1860
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Goes to end

1861
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
There's no

1862
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,368
Reason why

1863
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
No not given

1864
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:57,536
No the only reason he's given so far is because he wasn't

1865
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,304
Investigator

1866
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,840
Hillary is weird

1867
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,192
Right nevermind

1868
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:09,056
My question retracted it has been asked because he's not on the team

1869
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,896
I'm using some subjects

1870
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:23,392
To be completely and utterly subservient to the government like most good

1871
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,440
Absolutely

1872
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:31,072
To treat our government as above the rule of law

1873
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,632
The implied answer

1874
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,192
So then we go to

1875
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
Politicians are Country Club

1876
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,592
Start spacing Republican

1877
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
Brands them

1878
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,456
Yes Man and Country Club people

1879
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,552
Along with the Democrat the old the old guard in the same breath

1880
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
Includes after the fact

1881
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:58,720
He was just sitting on the Republicans than Democrats

1882
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Right

1883
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,048
Maybe the Democrats are Country Club people

1884
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,584
But there was a milk

1885
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,144
Blue Bloods

1886
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,472
They are they think being on Sienna and fox

1887
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,520
Is good yeah they think Bill Maher's cool

1888
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:13,824
Nobody

1889
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,640
I think Bill Bardo

1890
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,176
That's probably true

1891
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:22,272
Maybe whoever does the programming

1892
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,600
When that's actually embarrassed

1893
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,928
And old media if there's a big gust of wind will collapse

1894
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,720
Because old media is

1895
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Anti

1896
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:35,840
Free market has a pronoun reference gets weird

1897
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,424
Because he was talking about the the like

1898
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,704
The media and

1899
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,752
CNN and Bill Maher

1900
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
And all this

1901
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Ernie says

1902
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,592
Augusta wind will blow

1903
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,384
Right when he says it

1904
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Again

1905
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,432
Which Wich

1906
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,528
Reframe what you're talkin about the it refers to what

1907
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
Most previously referred to

1908
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
Which would be the media

1909
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,904
I believe it is a system

1910
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,232
That is anti-American

1911
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,584
That point I think of delineate

1912
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:13,984
So the rest of it you could think he was just talkin about Colbert

1913
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,032
Colbert

1914
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,128
Technological

1915
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,968
How else will they

1916
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,272
Remain relevant

1917
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,576
We need to be advanced

1918
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,160
Button sorry

1919
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:37,280
But that is an important part of the framework is it he's not being clear

1920
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
Just about

1921
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
But instead

1922
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,888
Are participating

1923
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,168
That is anti

1924
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,520
Sure

1925
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:54,176
Because their wives will make fun of them

1926
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:09,280
And then that's that's basically it that's what he said

1927
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,632
Like what can we do what is the point

1928
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,400
I don't

1929
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,680
I don't know

1930
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:22,080
Trying I think the the overall ideas trying to get across

1931
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,128
Use exegesis

1932
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,152
Is that

1933
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:32,064
Nobody's coming out by ship

1934
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,648
They're all still going on CNN and fox

1935
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:47,936
It's time to come on Infowars baby listen I got a new bra

1936
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:53,568
Jesse James

1937
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,360
She doesn't come on the show though

1938
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
I got Ted Nugent

1939
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,176
Right

1940
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,968
Rodger Stone Mike cernovich

1941
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,760
Ron Paul

1942
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:08,928
See that that was a real mystery context

1943
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,744
Anything out from before or after that makes it

1944
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
Is that

1945
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,448
These guys are going on those shows

1946
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
Challenged

1947
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,312
Where is it say where on

1948
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,080
On his show

1949
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,640
They would act

1950
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,200
Nobody would be calling them a Russian agent

1951
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,480
They would have nothing to

1952
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:36,064
Until all that's why they're cowards that's why they're cowards

1953
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,672
It's interesting because there's a high preponderance of people on his show that to have ties to Russia

1954
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:49,376
Alexander is absolutely a contemporary of

1955
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,216
On

1956
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
That's a good point

1957
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:57,056
If none of these people would be called Fresh aneja

1958
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
Since they went on it

1959
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:03,200
Jack Pacific

1960
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,784
Not called the resignation on the show

1961
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,832
Rodger Stone

1962
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:12,928
Rodger Stone hopefully soon-to-be jail register

1963
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:18,816
Hopefully soon-to-be hung from the neck in the streets

1964
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:25,216
Because we start a revolution no no no no no no

1965
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,264
Violently but because

1966
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,544
Finally we reckon

1967
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
Treason

1968
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
It's something that are Pres

1969
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,384
President shouldn't be allowed to commit

1970
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
And so the only way

1971
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,200
Tookie

1972
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
Any president from committing treason

1973
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
Never again

1974
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,296
Is 2

1975
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,832
Trump

1976
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,880
In the f****** Street

1977
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,672
On national TV

1978
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
I want

1979
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,768
Six-year-olds to watch an old man die

1980
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
Jesus

1981
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
F***** is trying to destroy the world

1982
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,424
I don't want him to be hung though because then that butthole

1983
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,824
It happens and it might look like a prolapsed anus if it gets hung up

1984
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,896
Prolapse

1985
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:08,736
Amos Mac

1986
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,272
Phoebe

1987
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
Treason

1988
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:16,416
Literally in the Constitution

1989
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,256
Literally

1990
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:24,864
Because he's allowed because we're doing an Alex Jones podcast Alex Jones

1991
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,192
Will not stop talking about how everyone's calling for the death of trump

1992
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,472
That's not what we're doing

1993
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,520
I want to be crystal clear about that

1994
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
Lest we fall into a trap

1995
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:38,688
Alex Jones is rhetorical bulshit calling for the rule of law to be

1996
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
I don't know

1997
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
At all

1998
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
Applied

1999
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:47,136
Yeah. You should at least get punched in the balls for the China trade

2000
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,440
I think that you're right

2001
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
Mostly

2002
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,512
About the media

2003
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,584
Being what he's talkin about a ton in that last

2004
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,656
Yeah but I know that it's about the globalist

2005
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
2

2006
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,448
Because

2007
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
We get to this next

2008
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Clip

2009
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,288
And I

2010
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,312
Title this clip

2011
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,360
The Last Temptation Of Jones

2012
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,832
Eli qe3 Romantics

2013
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,904
This Crusade

2014
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
B2B star or fail

2015
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:29,888

Speech

2020
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,688
Over Alfred

2021
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,992

So there's two more minutes of this clip lamp

2025
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,072
Clear already I don't believe

2026
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,632
No he's already talkingshit

2027
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,704
I don't understand

2028
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,032
What it is he thinks he means

2029
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,824
I know it's

2030
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,104
Exactly what he thinks

2031
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
Okay

2032
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
Sphinx

2033
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,760
No you didn't think what he's saying

2034
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Is

2035
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
The elite

2036
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,344
The globalist have come to him

2037
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,392
Repeatedly in the past

2038
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:27,232
This dumb Infowars iida trying to wake people up

2039
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,792
That's never going to work these dumb cattle

2040
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,608
They're never going to go figure out our game

2041
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:35,680
Public papers what we are going to do

2042
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,216
Hey don't even know they don't care

2043
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:39,776
They're stupid don't try and save them Alex

2044
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,056
Don't do it

2045
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,872
So they always come to Heaven they giving that speech and they're like

2046
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,712
Just come on it's good for your family

2047
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
Don't be a part of this

2048
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
Alex

2049
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:50,784
No baby

2050
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,088
I'm not into it I'm too real

2051
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
So he goes on

2052
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:56,672
Eagles aren't even further but that is what do you think

2053
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,952
100%

2054
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
With

2055
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,816
A 99% certainty

2056
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
But if that conversation ever happened

2057
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
It was someone f******

2058
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:12,800
I'm almost certain that someone told him in the past

2059
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,616
BuzzFeed article

2060
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:25,856
It starts with a discussion of how we used to have a Public Access TV show and there was a guy

2061
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
I can't remove the guys name now but

2062
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,440
I think it might have been like space

2063
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,512
Hitler

2064
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,328
Just constantly call him it prank calling

2065
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,144
He would just f*** with his TV show face Hitler

2066
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:44,544
It's like I have to believe that early on Space Hitler I'll be outside

2067
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,360
You might be in space Arjun

2068
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:01,184
So are the boys from space Brazil

2069
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:06,304
Entirely possible that in his early days and there was

2070
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,608
His principles and his beliefs and

2071
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
His backstory

2072
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
Of his own

2073
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
Making work coming together they're being

2074
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,728
Being formed

2075
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,776
I bet someone f***** with him

2076
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,568
And pretended that they had

2077
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
Deep information

2078
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Like that

2079
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
Pretended they were deepthroat

2080
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
Give you every

2081
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,600
See I would say what what I would

2082
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:31,904
Christian that with more likely there

2083
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:37,024
Okay I don't want to give Rios true he probably agree

2084
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
To it

2085
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,584
And then the guy was like

2086
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,168
Yeah that's realized it was such a good narrative device

2087
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,448
Right

2088
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,472
I can see that

2089
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,336
Dirt bikes

2090
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:55,712
Constantly try to coordinate absolutely refused

2091
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,248
Here's here's what I would say

2092
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,784
I would say

2093
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,064
It is more likely

2094
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,856
That he had

2095
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,880
Some talks with

2096
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:06,464
Fox News or one of those radio shows

2097
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,536
They basic they gave him the

2098
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,376
If we put you on a national platform

2099
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
You have to

2100
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,680
Two-tone some of this

2101
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:19,776
Like just that

2102
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:23,360
Hey if you start saying

2103
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,152
And we stood for it

2104
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:27,712
We're going to leave you out there on your own

2105
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,504
And we're not going to allow this app

2106
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,040
So that

2107
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:33,856
To me is what he would interpret as

2108
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
That exact

2109
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,928
Scenario that's interesting

2110
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:37,696
Completely reason

2111
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,512
Yeah I possible

2112
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,536
He is

2113
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Popular

2114
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,864
And time there's something

2115
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,400
With that kind of

2116
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,680
Support structure

2117
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,240
Some network will be like

2118
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,800
Give this a shot let's talk to this guy

2119
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,080
Let's set up a meeting

2120
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:55,104
Let's see what's going on

2121
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:01,504
Hurley going Fox News whenever they were turning themselves into the right

2122
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:07,648
That they are they must have been looking at him salivating and they gave Michael Savage

2123
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,792
The reason why he's been with Genesis

2124
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Communications

2125
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:18,144
For so long is that they are basically just a supplement

2126
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,680
And gold Hawking Network

2127
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,704
Anime don't give a s***

2128
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:29,664
F*** yeah whatever you want it is we're not responsible for whatever you say

2129
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,224
Are you take full responsibility

2130
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:38,624
Who was the last of the stuff

2131
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:42,208
Alex Infowars

2132
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,768
He says a lot more

2133
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,304
About is Temptation

2134
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
As it were

2135
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,912
Punk Girls

2136
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,472
But you really are

2137
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
Really

2138
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,552
He'll be part of this whole system

2139
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,136
How to be a vampire

2140
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,416
Culturally

2141
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,720
And play along with a deception

2142
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,304
No thank you

2143
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,424
Polite

2144
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:27,520
And now here we are

2145
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:31,104
14 years after I refused the first vial

2146
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
No thanks

2147
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,968
We change the world together

2148
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,504
Butterflies

2149
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,320
We're turning the corner because we believe in humanity

2150
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:44,160
We believe in Justice we believe in God

2151
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,464
We don't believe evil

2152
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,816
We don't use evil system shipping

2153
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
Yes you do

2154
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:52,864
Physical

2155
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
Monetarily

2156
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,424
Temporally

2157
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,984
Yet

2158
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,520
Literally means

2159
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,800
Time

2160
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,592
We don't use time travel

2161
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,736
Buy into those evil systems that make us stronger

2162
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
Physically

2163
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,528
Like

2164
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,344
Some sort of

2165
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,368
We don't

2166
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,720
108

2167
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:25,120
Like

2168
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,400
Santa temporarily

2169
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,168
Like

2170
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,056
Chinese song about tempura

2171
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,384
Temporarily

2172
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:42,016
I cut it slightly the wrong part

2173
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,344
That power

2174
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:46,880
The one ring

2175
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:51,232
Powers archetype people technology

2176
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
Use systems of deception

2177
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
9

2178
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:03,264
Poisons the world and poisons you

2179
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,848
Senor Sol

2180
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:11,200
And it's slowly taking you over until one day you never wake up

2181
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,504
And something else is running you

2182
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,064
Now you've given over your psyche

2183
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,904
You're so what I got put in your body

2184
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,232
He's literally just Golem in

2185
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:30,656
Liquor I bet you can't really go on that long of a

2186
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,424
Tangent

2187
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,264
Without somehow finding one of his Touchstone

2188
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,056
That is a pop culture thing

2189
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,384
Like you can't not reference a movie or a book

2190
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,408
Or something like that

2191
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:44,736
The metaphor is thin in his language

2192
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,784
You know what is not

2193
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,624
I mean we don't know these

2194
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,232
People these globalist who had their lives ruined by the metaphorical rings

2195
01:50:55,488 --> 01:51:00,608
The world Alex maybe know a bunch more than us cuz he has met these people NES

2196
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Fault about them

2197
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,288
Donald Trump

2198
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,872
I want to tell you about them

2199
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,920
It also is eventually going to get into state

2200
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,272
I have been around billionaires Global sellouts the system

2201
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:27,488
Robots they're just like crazy weird fumbling morons

2202
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,608
Weird fumbling people

2203
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:50,528
Hollywood's the worst model of control

2204
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:53,600
Beautiful people

2205
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,696
Hollywood didn't make them somebody Hollywood stole their greatness

2206
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:00,512
Around

2207
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:04,352
No one bought your script Alex Jones

2208
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:10,752
It's 50/50

2209
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,288
He just listen to Candle in the Wind

2210
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,824
Which one of the two

2211
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:24,064
Why would you okay

2212
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,880
Was founded

2213
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:33,280
The obvious things

2214
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,072
Reason you would go after

2215
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,096
You know

2216
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,144
Hollywood

2217
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
Is because that

2218
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,960
The touchdown that you are listening base

2219
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:46,080
This is like our values Hollywood

2220
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:49,408
Stop the world exactly

2221
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:55,808
The liberal Elite out-of-work actors what to feel and think

2222
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,000
Options of MKUltra type

2223
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:10,400
Stuff like all these people Hollywood urgent brain-controlled and sex slaves and s*** like

2224
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,216
We should put together a list

2225
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:29,600
We don't want to invite

2226
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:36,000
Color of royalty

2227
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,376
Alright this is done

2228
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:47,008
In the world and built systems

2229
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,288
Like Hollywood

2230
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,104
Devil

2231
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:59,808
You're so like a deal out of it

2232
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:08,000
Devil doesn't give you any of this

2233
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,680
I don't I don't I don't get what

2234
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,960
First of all so funny

2235
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,544
Total sense

2236
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,104
No

2237
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,176
You can make yourself Incubus

2238
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,992
But the devil can't give you any of this

2239
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,296
Irene

2240
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
Why sell your soul

2241
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,392
It's almost like the devil is

2242
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:38,464
It is very much like that

2243
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,256
Alex Jones like

2244
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,560
He's legitimately

2245
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,584
Maybe

2246
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,936
4 steps away from atheism

2247
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,240
He's two steps away from believing in Chris

2248
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:54,336
Will eventually be like

2249
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,360
You know

2250
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,664
Birth crystals

2251
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
Your hand

2252
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:03,552
He's not sponsor away from me

2253
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,624
Crystal shop

2254
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,672
Hey Alex I'll give you a hundred bucks

2255
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,440
Just f******

2256
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,744
Tell him that you liked bezoars

2257
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,536
Seems like I'm in I don't even know if that's a crystal

2258
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:17,376
No it is actually something

2259
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,656
It comes from the

2260
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,984
Aaron Donald

2261
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,520
Grows in there and then

2262
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,544
It comes out

2263
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,360
It heals diseases it's like a pants

2264
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,224
That is

2265
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,856
But so he was like a talking about

2266
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,208
Deal with Satan but

2267
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,744
But you can't sell your soul YouTube

2268
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,792
How do you sell your soul

2269
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:50,912
He already said all of these people have sold their sold and they are satanic and they

2270
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,704
Because of that worship

2271
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
If they get their power

2272
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
Bingo

2273
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
So where

2274
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,104
Nothing nothing

2275
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
Nothing is

2276
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
Nothing nothing

2277
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,456
Here's where that

2278
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,528
Sort of dovetails into Alex Jones it's like

2279
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,880
Espoused

2280
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
Bargain

2281
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
But you didn't

2282
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,976
Because you can never know if you did

2283
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,144
Legitimate

2284
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,680
This

2285
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:28,032
Highlights for me the idea that Alex Jones has no coherent philosophy

2286
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,104
He has no intrinsic set of principles

2287
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,152
In the same way that two episodes

2288
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,944
We were talking about

2289
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,992
Him in his Marathon

2290
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:40,320
He legitimately said Trump was the Butt Boy

2291
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:46,720
Of a bunch of different people

2292
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:49,024
Military industrial complex

2293
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,584
He wasn't saying that

2294
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,608
You were saying

2295
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
Well

2296
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,216
It's gone

2297
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:02,592
His Trump

2298
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,896
I've been selling as well after he called him up but

2299
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,432
3 days later

2300
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:10,784
Trust in Trump has risen from the dead

2301
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,344
Trump is a butt boy

2302
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:18,464
Donald Trump it's implied we don't need to go through it

2303
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,048
He said it

2304
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,168
This crazy line with Trump

2305
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,448
He's wavering

2306
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:32,032
Like I don't even know exactly what he believes about Satan

2307
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,056
Or demons

2308
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:35,360
He just brings it up

2309
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:38,688
Yeah there's no consistent through line between like

2310
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:41,248
What is your cosmology about demon

2311
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,528
What are they

2312
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,296
Right

2313
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,344
Cuz if he ever was nailed down on it

2314
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:49,184
Putting believes in literal vampire

2315
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:56,352
Well maybe not literal vampire spiritual vampires

2316
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,400
Don't say they drink cuz the adrenochrome

2317
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,424
Jesus

2318
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
He does

2319
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,616
He does believe

2320
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
The I don't know

2321
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,176
I don't either

2322
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,760
Here is here is what I would say

2323
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,528
Say if I was going

2324
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,344
Foil down

2325
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,696
Good luck

2326
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
Is belief system

2327
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,768
Good f****** luck it is

2328
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,096
Whatever the

2329
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:28,864
The f*** he

2330
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
He feels like

2331
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:30,400
Attending

2332
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,080
You know what that's that's a conversation that we did have off are where it's

2333
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:44,480
Only thing that the only thing you can't go back

2334
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,088
Exactly what he believes about these very

2335
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,672
But you never is specific about who globalist

2336
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,744
He never actually sites documents

2337
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,280
Riding the wave

2338
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:00,352
I have told you on this

2339
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,376
Episode

2340
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,424
The specific place

2341
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,984
Where I found a bunch of information

2342
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:09,824
Cleancult

2343
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,616
I've specifically told you

2344
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,664
Where the document is

2345
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,688
It backs up

2346
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,712
My claim

2347
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
President Obama

2348
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,808
Vito the sale of a company

2349
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,856
That was trying to sell microchips

2350
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
Is

2351
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:33,120
Blah blah blah blah white papers I read their books the books

2352
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,400
To affect your no longer

2353
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,168
Slippery

2354
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,192
And I think

2355
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,472
That he could not exist

2356
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
Did not advise

2357
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:43,104
Demons and that relates also to

2358
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,920
That is negotiable

2359
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:57,184
Supervisor

2360
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
Sorry go ahead

2361
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,816
This time for real

2362
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,448
So

2363
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,752
So my rebuttal on that

2364
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
He does have

2365
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,056
Through-line

2366
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,360
Sure does have touched

2367
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,152
Now

2368
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,944
If I was going to

2369
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:24,064
Well that's that's actually just what I was thinking

2370
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,880
Like you know how most of the through lines of

2371
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,208
You take the individual details away from it

2372
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,744
Anti-semitism

2373
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:34,048
Distrust of minorities

2374
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,328
Anti-muslim

2375
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,912
Cultural fears

2376
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,984
Absolutely but then it all relates back to

2377
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,752
The globalist

2378
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,544
Like

2379
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
Goes back to Aunt

2380
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,616
But it's

2381
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:51,968
And it with the Ghostbuster such a nebulous nonexistent

2382
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,760
-4 stitches

2383
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,784
You can describe any

2384
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,552
Problem today

2385
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:58,112
Gas went up

2386
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,184
Global gas went down it's because Trump

2387
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,720
Is fighting global

2388
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:07,840
Like any number of different things that are

2389
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:08,864
The genius thing

2390
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,888
And some level

2391
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,936
Nnr respect

2392
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,728
We're kind of ham

2393
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:16,288
Kind of locked into the fact that we have to

2394
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,056
To fight against

2395
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,336
A real person

2396
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:23,456
Are you like it better you have to do work I like it better that way though because when

2397
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:27,808
He says these things about let's say for example Hillary selling the rainy

2398
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
I can

2399
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,648
Look at him

2400
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,208
No

2401
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:37,536
I know that

2402
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
You know what's interesting

2403
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,888
If if we switch positions

2404
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,472
I think it would be much more similar to The Alex Jones Show

2405
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:46,752
Where I have just

2406
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:51,616
Read like a whole bunch of s*** and I don't quite have it all locked into my brain

2407
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:55,456
Lake Lanier

2408
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,064
Like I would play an Alex Jones clip and I wouldn't research it all be like

2409
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:05,184
I heard of The Washington Post that they that this was wrong

2410
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,000
Yeah it's even worse

2411
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,280
I would be the warmest

2412
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,328
Infowars cast

2413
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,888
Adjusting

2414
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:17,216
Baby

2415
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,264
Tell you what

2416
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,824
Alex wants to talk more about the

2417
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:29,760
Interfacing with the Devil

2418
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,040
This whole system

Narnia

2427
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:12,256
You're talking about the devil

2428
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:18,656
Give a hundred bucks to your local station

Also I looked into it does have an affiliate in

2434
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,992
So not

2435
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:37,344
The actual broadcast barely reaches

2436
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:39,136
So

2437
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:39,904
I mean maybe you could

2438
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
Could get a bad version

2439
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:44,256
Alex Jones on the actual radio in Chicago

2440
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:46,816
But the idea that he says that he has actually

2441
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:47,840
I'm engaged

2442
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:48,608
Some research

2443
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,400
Difficult to do

2444
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,168
Because

2445
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,704
Yeah he's not lying

2446
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
He doesn't

2447
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,240
Have a list

2448
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:56,032
Of his current affiliates

2449
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,336
I looked into the code on the website

2450
02:03:59,104 --> 02:03:59,616
That's right

2451
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,176
That's right I did

2452
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,552
Genesis Communications

2453
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,856
Network has a list of affiliate

2454
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,904
Broadcast

2455
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,952
And that's what we discussed on our fourth episode

2456
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,512
Yes I looked into code on that website

2457
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,304
What time is it been update

2458
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:21,120
In the code lifetime

2459
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
2015

2460
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,680
Really yeah

2461
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:26,496
The number is actually off

2462
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:30,848
Saving I've started to engage in a little bit of research going through the top radio markets

2463
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:33,920
The actual radio station

2464
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:37,504
Station has a website

2465
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,784
And they have their schedules on

2466
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:42,624
Kind of a complicated process of figuring out

2467
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,160
The stations in each City

2468
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:44,928
It takes forever

2469
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:48,000
So I started the Chicago

2470
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,792
Supposedly caters to

2471
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:53,376
Chicago the third largest radio Market in the United States

2472
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,192
Based out of the suburbs and fairly

2473
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,728
Right

2474
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:03,104
Is alive but I'm excited

2475
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,432
Rural or bourbon

2476
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,040
Suburban

2477
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:15,392
Yeah but I'm excited too

2478
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,928
Give you the results

2479
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:17,952
That investigation

2480
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:20,000
As it comes

2481
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,024
Email address

2482
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:24,096
The only thing I've done

2483
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:24,864
This email address

2484
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:27,424
Is I've signed up for the Infowars newsletter

2485
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:31,520
Cuz I want to see if they sell my information

2486
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,544
Getting spam

2487
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:35,616
Is someone that's kind of interesting it's like 3 weeks

2488
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:37,664
Since I signed up for it

2489
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,456
I've gotten nothing

2490
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,736
Except from Alex Jones

2491
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:42,784
Relight the app

2492
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:43,552
But

2493
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:45,600
The first of this is really just a

2494
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,624
The True Believer kind of

2495
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:49,952
But the first thing that I got from Ally

2496
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,536
Is

2497
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:55,584

And I haven't I haven't yet

2526
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:01,888
But I'm certain most of it has to do with selling his

2527
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,192
Like his survival food

2528
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,984
Oh yeah I'm positive

2529
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,520
Okay but anyway

2530
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,312

Ironic

2533
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:20,320
Was the blueprint

2534
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:23,136
Like if you read it and you're like

2535
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:27,744
This is good advice and then you start taking all of it and then

2536
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,768
You survived

2537
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:35,168
Because of that and I'm sitting over here like Alex Jones silly there's no reason

2538
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:38,240
What does feel like the world is coming to an end

2539
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,312
That flawed

2540
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,640

If you want

2545
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:53,856
To talk about how like

2546
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,392
Maybe Alex is right

2547
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,184
A+

2549
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,744
As evident

2550
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,280
But you should shut your goddamn mouth

2551
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,560
Cuz this

2552
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,888
Is like I know that we've talked about chimeras

2553
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,472
This is

2554
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,264
Humanize

2555
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,032

2556
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,336

50

2559
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:31,488
Rochester good enough to fool top engineers

2560
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:37,120
It doesn't matter they don't have solar unconscious

2561
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:40,448
Wired into billions of people's actions everyday

2562
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:43,008
Build algorithms

2563
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,360
Before you even know it

2564
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
That is true

2565
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,248
Panda free will

2566
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,320

02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:00,672
The D evolution of man

2568
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:08,864
It's saying no mothers and fathers family unit

2569
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:13,984
No just take drugs and watch TV I just Bliss out

2570
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:19,872
A lot of his life

2571
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,640
Trans argue

2572
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:26,528
Just because some people have different identities

2573
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,832
It doesn't mean that mothers and fathers are bad

2574
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:33,952
The only time that I've ever heard any concrete examples

2575
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,720
Is

2576
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,000
Times when there are like

2577
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,792
People talking about divorce

2578
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:40,864
Parents like single parent implying that

2579
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,888
Someone has a dad

2580
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,448
When they might not have a dad

2581
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:49,568
You have a single mom like somebody

2582
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:50,848
Inasmuch as

2583
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:52,384
They have an absentee father

2584
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,152
Right

2585
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,712
If you want it is that is his argument

2586
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:58,784
Kernel of something we can go from there

2587
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,344
I guess but the idea of like

2588
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:03,904
Deltrans identities and differing

2589
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,928
Gender

2590
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,976
Non-binary stuff

2591
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
No mothers

2592
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,792
No fathers no families

2593
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,072
Write incredibly

2594
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:14,912
Is he's not wrong

2595
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,680
About

2596
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,448

2597
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,544
Shut up shut up

2598
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,104
I'll tell you why it's not important because

2599
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,128
Of the merciful

2600
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:31,040
That is Cambridge analytica trying to do

2601
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:33,600
Exactly what they're trying to do

2602
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:36,416
Concussion

2603
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:43,584
Absolutely

2604
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,912
Talking about

2605
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:51,264
Edgar that nullified they are f***** up

2606
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,872
They are instead so Disco

2608
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:03,040
Species Extinction

2609
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,184
Very selfish motive

2610
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:17,376
People on the planet are creating new species as fast as they can every few hours

2611
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,656
Feeling the human race

2612

Literally wouldn't

2624
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:03,200
With roaches and then moves to cat literally what he's talking about is that

2625
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:09,600
Russian spying stuff like they're trying to spy on the Russians by putting a microphone in a cat

2626
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:13,184
It's not a robot cat

2627
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,464
Robot cats

2628
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,864
The sixties everybody does this not a robot

2629
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:27,776
They've already know know they're developing new species every hour

2630
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:30,592
New species of viruses bacteria

2631
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:33,920
Animal / plant / insectoid

2632
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:41,088
Flash taco

2633
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:41,856
I don't know

2634
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:44,672
Deep Earth crystals got2b

2635
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:49,280
Got2b that I don't know if you remember this

2636
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,560
Just Jordan

2637
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:53,632
Hour ago or so in the Bronx

2638
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,936
Open up the phone

2639
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,728
Yes I do remember

2640
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,288
But now he's about to

2641
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,056
Okay

2642
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:08,480
He's going to open up the phones and any

2643
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,528
Minitab

2644
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,648
Beth Ben Adam Harry

2645
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:18,720
I thought that was one guy he doesn't

2646
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:23,584
How to go to Robert Perry Jones broadcast

2647
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:28,448
Cuz it lies with this we believe

2648
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:33,824
We believe in free market we believe in open societies

2649
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:35,360
He's really hitting the best card

2650
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:38,432
You nailed it under your breath

2651
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:40,736
Although

2652
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:43,040
Time document

2653
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:45,856
No

2654
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
I think

2655
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:51,232
It's incredibly frustrating

2656
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:53,536
You hear someone lie enough without concert

2657
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,328
You start to realize

2658
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:58,144
Supposed to be

2659
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,448
It doesn't matter if you believe it it's

2660
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:01,728
Just the act of saying

2661
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:02,752
Important

2662
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:04,544
And that's really f***** up

2663
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,824
I think

2664
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:07,872
The meme I'm talking about Alex

2665
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,712
Here's what here's what I would say

2666
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,760
Because this is a conversation that I had

2667
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,296
With a family member

2668
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:18,112
When we were talking about

2669
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:22,720
How do you know that

2670
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,280
And I was like well because

2671
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,816
There's all this research

2672
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:27,840
Your review 90s

2673
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:29,632
The Great

2674
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:31,680
Experiments that are repeatable

2675
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:33,216
How do you know they're not lying to

2676
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,008
5

2677
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,032
Well

2678
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:37,056
Because that

2679
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:39,104
How we establish

2680
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:44,224
Experimenter repeatable

2681
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,248
Not just that like

2682
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:48,320
How do I become a giant

2683
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,088
Conspiracy

2684
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,952
You play that game with me

2685
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,488
No I do

2686
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:57,536
But here's how here's how I know

2687
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,816
Because we

2688
02:14:59,072 --> 02:14:59,840
Phone

2689
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:01,888
That's it

2690
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,704
How do you how do you know they're not lying to you

2691
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,752
Because every time you make a f******

2692
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
Phone call

2693
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,080
The call is routed

2694
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:10,848
2 West Saddle

2695
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:13,664
The satellite has to account for the fact that it's

2696
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,432
Traveling

2697
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,736
So that mean

2698
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,040
That because of that time dilation

2699
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:22,368
We know for a fact that he does equal a

2700
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:25,184
We know the theory of relativity is

2701
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:27,488
Because it has to account for that

2702
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,768
Otherwise it won't work

2703
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,608
You're you're the clock on your phone because it is right

2704
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,400
Means that Einstein

2705
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:36,704
So whether or not

2706
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,264
You want to pull this research bulshit

2707
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:42,592
Here's how you know things are true Jordan because

2708
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:43,616
They work

2709
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:50,784
If you if you don't believe in climate change

2710
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,088
Then get rid of your phone because B

2711
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:56,928
Because it doesn't work for you I really bad news

2712
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:04,096
You know how damn you know how you've never been walking around and been like who turns the math off

2713
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,400
I was trying to tip

2714
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:12,800
20% neurologist kept writing with 404 not found that has happened when I've been drunk

2715
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:20,992
Someone did turn the map off the other night when we were out of the whip over typically crazy

2716
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,832
Oh this is the bad news

2717
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,368
This out

2718
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:28,416
Entirely but about

2719
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,976
35 minutes of the show Alex

2720
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,000
Interview the climate

2721
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:32,768
Tonight

2722
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:35,584
God

2723
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:38,656
Al Gore

2724
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:45,056
What factors climate deniers what else do you want me to be angry about Dan

2725
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:51,456
That's why I cut it. I don't want you just blowing a gasket

2726
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:53,760
Has a new documentary

2727
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,808
A sequel to

2728
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,600
And Alex's

2729
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,624
Furious about it

2730
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,904
The energies of climate

2731
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,928
About it

2732
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:04,256
Not worth breaking

2733
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,280
Down

2734
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:07,328
Cuz it's specially cuz outside of this

2735
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:10,400
This narrative it's outside of the

2736
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:13,216
Rambling globalist

2737
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,008
Other than again

2738
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:17,056
Other than those bright

2739
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,128
Look at these Keys over here I'm Jacqueline these caves

2740
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:21,408
Don't pay attention

2741
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,688
To our corrupt

2742
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,760
Felony committed president

2743
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:30,112
It's exactly the same reason that on the day of the shooting in Charleston

2744
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:34,464
We may never recover this episode I'm not entirely sure but I just listen to it

2745
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,744
Good day

2746
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,768
Of that shooting

2747
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:38,560
Alex Jones

2748
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,888
I would say an hour of the show

2749
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:43,424
Interviewing a lady

2750
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,704
Coup

2751
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:45,728
Captain coats

2752
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,008
In her house

2753
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,080
Kansas City Council

2754
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:55,456
You cannot keep your house

2755
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:03,648
Guns and ghosts in my house and I don't need a background check

2756
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,184
Her argument was

2757
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:10,048
Because of its back to me when she was very young

2758
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,840
And she couldn't make breast milk

2759
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,376
And she didn't trust

2760
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,400
Formula

2761
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,192
So she needed goat

2762
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:19,008
In order to make the milk cuz buying goat milk

2763
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,568
The sources that they come from

2764
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:23,104
It's all night

2765
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:29,504
I'm on climate change side note on climate change aside I want the Earth

2766
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:35,904
To wipe us out this is the day to a black church

2767
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,696
And shot a bunch of people

2768
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:40,768
I don't know why you would need to cover that also keep in mind

2769
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:41,536
It's

2770
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:43,072
The day after

2771
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:45,632
I forgot about this Confluence of the

2772
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,704
That's the day after Trump announced his candidacy

2773
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:49,728
Cheese's

2774
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:52,800
F****** Christ Within

2775
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:57,152
That 24-hours expensive

2776
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,944
Who has a website

2777
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,272
I'm Pro goat.

2778
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,928
Jordan

2779
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:09,952
You asked

2780
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,976
Why is he

2781
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:11,744
You spending

2782
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,048
This Ray Vaughan hits his

2783
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:18,144
Call me

2784
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,704
Why is he spending an hour of it

2785
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:26,336
Rambling about globalist and saying I've been tempted they make

2786
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,104
Do with

2787
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,664
Toby Lee fired

2788
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,688
You don't have any

2789
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,480
Right

2790
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:35,296
And I'll be honest the interview with the climate denier

2791
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:37,344
If you take the climate denial out of it

2792
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,624
What's a spirited interview

2793
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:39,904
The guy

2794
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:40,928
Was kind of fun

2795
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:45,280
He's wrong about everything

2796
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:53,216
That's more than can be said for so many other people that everyone except Rappaport

2797
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:59,616
Shout out to everybody who has tweeted that out of

2798
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,456
So we have one more question

2799
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:05,504
From the rapper floor to the rapper floor

2800
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:11,392
Is no longer we're policy walk

2801
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:14,208
It's Rappaport still live there's no doubt about it

2802
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:20,608
Alright

2803
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:26,240
Donate

2804
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:32,640
Ceremonious

2805
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:39,040
Rapoport is going to be about

2806
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:46,208
If not what

2807
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,048
Oh that's right we have perhaps

2808
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:55,680
Establish that he is Gandalf

2809
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:00,800
You died

2810
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:01,824
If you

2811
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,592
He is the pic

2812
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,784
I can't tell if the picture is a young version of him

2813
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,808
I don't know

2814
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,112
But

2815
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:14,880
Trapped

2816
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:19,744
He died

2817
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,512
Yes

2818
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:21,536
I will

2819
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:22,304
F******

2820
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,328
Burien

2821
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,864
If I'm not asked to give a speech

2822
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:29,984
If I'm not here, Mario

2823
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:35,104
There is nobody in the united goddamn States of America

2824
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:37,408
That cares about him in the same way would I do

2825
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,688
Snow White

2826
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:44,832
If

2827
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:47,136
I think it's

2828
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:48,672
Be honest

2829
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,440
Not

2830
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:51,232
As a

2831
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,512
Perfect shrine

2832
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,328
To what Rapport means to all of

2833
02:21:55,584 --> 02:22:01,728
That's the greatest conflict of my life is like is a tribute to him hanging up that picture finally once he's gone

2834
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:07,360
Or or spear tackling anybody who tries to put it up

2835
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,384
Like

2836
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:11,456
Lake on constant vigil the rest of my life

2837
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:13,504
Is standing in a three-point stance

2838
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,272
Yeah

2839
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,040
I dare you

2840
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:21,440
Google Play version

2841
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:25,536
So f*** all this noise Rappaport will die and I won't speak it

2842
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,840
Funeral

2843
02:22:28,096 --> 02:22:29,632
And this one

2844
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:31,680
Is where

2845
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:33,216
I know

2846
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:33,984
We didn't make

2847
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,520
It's clear but we drank a bottle of wine

2848
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:39,104
Vineyard

2849
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,664
It's only appropriate because

2850
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,992
This is kind of an ironic episode

2851
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:48,064
Pretty much Alex Jones in his attempt

2852
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:48,832
2

2853
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:50,880
Tar and feather,

2854
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:54,208
Make light of the Russia investigation

2855
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:56,512
Is really showing his cars but he has no facts

2856
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:58,304
On his side he only has

2857
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,584
Insinuation

2858
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,120
Lies

2859
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:02,656
Fake stories

2860
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:03,936
All his ideas nothing

2861
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:06,752
In the back

2862
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:10,080
He's failing in his depends

2863
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:11,872
His denials

2864
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:16,224
He is actually directly pointing to why they're being vested

2865
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,248
Exactly

2866
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:18,784
They shouldn't

2867
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,368
Investigating Hillary for this

2868
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,160
Instead they're investigating Trump

2869
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:24,928
4

2870
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,816
So it's always like

2871
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:33,376
Here is what they should be doing and it

2872
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:35,168
It's the same thing they should be doing

2873
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:37,728
Here it's never is always a

2874
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:38,752
Complete parallel

2875
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:40,032
It's never like

2876
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:45,152
Also I love the fact I love the fact that there are no new Boogeyman for

2877
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:48,992
There's only sorrow there's only there's only Hillary

2878
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:52,832
But that's

2879
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:55,136
That's Brazil

2880
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,672
So

2881
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:57,952
Their constant fight

2882
02:23:59,232 --> 02:23:59,744
Distracting

2883
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,768
From the fact that

2884
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:01,536
They can act

2885
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:05,888
Was really you know other than turning this into a

2886
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:07,168
Authoritarian government

2887
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,960
That has no respect for the rule of law

2888
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,752
Stanley trying to flatter than ever

2889
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,288
Is

2890
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,104
Directly compromised by Russia

2891
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,432
Absolutely cowardly and incapable

2892
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:19,200
Protect

2893
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:20,736
F******

2894
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:22,528
Country from the facts

2895
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:25,856
That all of this s*** is destroying

2896
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:26,624
Christine America

2897
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:27,392
All because

2898
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:35,584
This is all but not Alex Alex

2899
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,864
Destroyed

2900
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,632
Democracy

2901
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:41,984
So we can get a 20% lower marginal tax

2902
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,800
You're talking about the real world

2903
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:47,872
Alright

2904
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,944
His motivations are

2905
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:51,712
Isn't

2906
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,272
That's what's crazy

2907
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:56,320
Like

2908
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:00,928
I need to leave the real world at the door

2909
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:04,256
The tax cut motivation

2910
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:10,656
Understand Alex's globalist narrative

2911
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,680
Alex's globalist

2912
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,496
As best I can tell it's bologna

2913
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:16,544
But let's get back to the center

2914
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,336
The irony

2915
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:22,688
Is what we've already laid out

2916
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,968
But I wanted to introduce a

2917
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,992
The further irony

2918
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,528
And this clip

2919
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:27,808
Alex Jones

2920
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,088
Loses

2921
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,368
A little bit

2922
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,184
Frases

2923
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,976
Overt racism

2924
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,280
Overt hatred

2925
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:41,120
Really shows that

2926
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:43,168
His side has nothing

2927
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,448
This is what they have

2928
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:45,472
Right here

2929
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,752
This is it

2930
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:48,288
This is at this clip

2931
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,056
Is

2932
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:55,712
Ferguson Austin already

2933
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:57,504
Yeah

2934
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:00,064
If Ferguson is your first city where

2935
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,600
Fox what there's a reason

2936
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:03,136
Hold on

2937
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:06,208
Bakersfield everywhere

2938
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:07,744
And there just are going

2939
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:21,824
Buses of offloaded college kids bunch of white ones getting off saying the halls of Dead Cops

2940
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:28,224
So they they all the stories that have come out about busing in protesters and stuff like that have all been debunked

2941
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:29,760
Audience

2942
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:31,040
Because of that

2943
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,576
In terms of pay protesters

2944
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,624
People getting off buses

2945
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:36,928
Stuff like that are all are all

2946
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:40,768
But then he refuses to engage with the idea that the reason

2947
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:42,560
That these black lives matter

2948
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:49,728
Even the further black nationalist groups that are a little bit further

2949
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:51,008
On that side

2950
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:56,384
Yakub black lives matter 5%

2951
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,176
Include white people

2952
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:01,760
I would definitely

2953
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:03,296
The reason

2954
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,624
Cops about

2955
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,648
At least

2956
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:08,928
Is the cops

2957
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,208
Keep killing

2958
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,232
Black people

2959
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,792
With no repercussions

2960
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:15,584
They kill white people as well

2961
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,632
Absolutely is true but it seems

2962
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:18,912
Definitely

2963
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:20,704
If you look at the statistics they kill

2964
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,240
Proportionate

2965
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,520
Never Gitana

2966
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:26,080
So when group

2967
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:29,152
Such as black lives matter and nationalistic

2968
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,944
Talk about killing cops

2969
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:33,504
It's not so much they just want to kill cop

2970
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,296
It's a expression

2971
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:37,088
Frustration

2972
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,904
That they seem a of their community

2973
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,440
Get choked out

2974
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,464
Alma Street

2975
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,256
For selling loose cigarettes

2976
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,792
And no one can

2977
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:47,072
Totally

2978
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:48,864
Utterly justifiable

2979
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:51,936
Yeah it is it total

2980
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:53,728
Frustration with

2981
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:58,080
I know it's a Justified

2982
02:27:58,848 --> 02:27:59,616
They aren't killing

2983
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,920
They are

2984
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:02,688
Saying

2985
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:04,480
F*** these cops

2986
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:07,552
Like yours no one wants to kill cop

2987
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,832
Here's the thing that drives me

2988
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,624
Do you know what they want

2989
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,672
Not to be killed by cops

2990
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:13,440
Justice

2991
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:17,792
If you because here's the here's the real deal

2992
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:18,816
If you just

2993
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:19,584
Prosecuted

2994
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,352
These cops

2995
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:24,704
And made sure because isn't that the whole point of all of these punish

2996
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:26,240
The whole point

2997
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,008
Is the actors

2998
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:30,336
So if you see Justice being a

2999
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,104
Applied

3000
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:33,152
Equally then you can say

3001
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:34,688
This is a deterrent

3002
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:35,712
Futurecop

3003
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:42,624
Killing black much like you're hanging a president it is not it is it is a punishment but it

3004
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,904
It is really just

3005
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:44,672
Don't

3006
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:46,976
Do this because there is going to be

3007
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:53,632
I would say further it's a reason to

3008
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:55,680
Does the people aren't

3009
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,824
Yeah and there's nothing really

3010
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:02,848
What I understand

3011
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:05,920
Beartooth

3012
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,712
Sometimes

3013
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:08,736
A cop

3014
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:09,504
Makes

3015
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:11,040
A bad kill

3016
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:14,112
This does happen

3017
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,904
You know you're on a bus

3018
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:18,464
Or something like that someone jumps out in front of you

3019
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,000
You kill somebody

3020
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:21,024
It happens

3021
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,048
And the reason

3022
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,840
That people are mad

3023
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:24,608
Police puppies

3024
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,144
Or not those in

3025
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:27,680
They are

3026
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:28,448
Use

3027
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,984
Unarmed youth

3028
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:31,008
That are killed

3029
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:31,776
Chill

3030
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,312
Sure

3031
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:35,616
No

3032
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:36,640
Cleveland

3033
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:39,968
There are children there are unarmed children

3034
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:44,576
Women there was that incident

3035
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:45,600
Michael Brown

3036
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:48,672
I can't I can't even remember the guys name cuz there's too many of them

3037
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:52,768
Was killed in his car with his girlfriend

3038
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:53,536
How many

3039
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:56,864
It's come to a boiling point where it's

3040
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,400
Think about this

3041
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:01,984
If you think about the 8th people weren't pissed off and saying

3042
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,008
F*** the police

3043
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:04,288
Read it would be insane

3044
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:05,312
Think about how

3045
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,848
Angry we are right

3046
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,664
Flouting the rule of law

3047
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:11,456
Now imagine

3048
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:13,760
Every single member of your

3049
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,552
4

3050
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:17,088
The entire it

3051
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,112
Distance of your

3052
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,392
Family as far back

3053
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:20,672
You can remember them being

3054
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:21,696
In America

3055
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:22,720
Being subject

3056
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:24,768
To that same level of ingest

3057
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:26,048
And

3058
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,376
Worse and look at how angry we are now

3059
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:30,400
And this is

3060
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,168
Really

3061
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:35,776
The first time in my life where I've had to look at the government

3062
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:38,080
And say these people are affecting

3063
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,360
Personal

3064
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:41,152
And destroying mate

3065
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:42,944
As opposed to Mayans

3066
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:43,712
Higher life

3067
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:49,088
Printed on my back

3068
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:49,856
Pathetical

3069
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:55,744
Trying to take my health insurance away they're trying to figure out

3070
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,024
Yeah that's true

3071
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,560
Still not really expecting

3072
02:30:58,816 --> 02:30:59,840
And I'm not

3073
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:01,888
I'm not being

3074
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,448
I am not being detained at the airport

3075
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:05,472
I am not

3076
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:08,800
Minecraft

3077
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:11,360
None of these things are having nobody's rating my house

3078
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,152
Peoria

3079
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:15,712
And all of this is happening

3080
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:16,480
Two other people

3081
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:18,528
Alex Jones his inability

3082
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,064
Deal with the abstract

3083
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,088
To deal with

3084
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:21,856
The reality of

3085
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:22,624
Give the world

3086
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,904
Is really embarrassing

3087
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:25,952
Like the idea that he is

3088
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:28,256
Is just

3089
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,816
Cotton dry making it like

3090
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:33,376
These people walking around they want to kill cops

3091
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:35,424
Liberals bottle lights

3092
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:42,592
I don't know how to put it exactly but I would say it's an embarrassing lack of nuance

3093
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:45,920
It is

3094
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:47,712
Absolutely

3095
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:49,248
Are they completely

3096
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:50,784
For other human

3097
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:52,576
Let's get back to this

3098
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:55,648
We're in the middle of the clip I forgot

3099
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:56,416
This clip is

3100
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:57,696
It gets way worse

3101
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:12,032
Let's let's

3102
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:17,408
People were murdered in the armed forces

3103
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,200
You start Turnpike

3104
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:39,424
Call you slave Douglas country dumbasses

3105
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,472
You piece of f****** s***

3106
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:43,776
That's so dog whistle

3107
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:44,800
Goddamn

3108
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:45,824
F****** garbage

3109
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:49,664
It's impossible to hear that and not here

3110
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,224
Essentially

3111
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:55,296
Behind Patriot

3112
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:56,576
The earliest

3113
02:32:57,088 --> 02:33:02,720
Texas country in the earlier but we got off

3114
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:03,744
He says their butt

3115
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:08,352
He specifically points which is there busing in

3116
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:10,912
Traitors to the race absolutely

3117
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:12,448
Hundred percent

3118
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:13,984
Exactly what it means

3119
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:18,848
They're busting in white so glad you picked up on my absolute

3120
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:24,224
This is the eternal battle with Alex Jones is like

3121
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:26,272
I know he feels that

3122
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,088
But I don't know how aware he is that he feels

3123
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:31,904
Cuz you wouldn't say those things that you did

3124
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,672
Fuel them

3125
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:34,720
Right now it's eating him

3126
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,768
That is what he's expressing

3127
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,072
But it's not clear to me

3128
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,608
That he is like

3129
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:41,888
Consciously being like

3130
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:45,472
I'm going to

3131
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:47,264
Right I don't know if that's

3132
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:52,896
Well that's good, that's a basic

3133
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:56,992
That idea of there busing in white people

3134
02:33:57,504 --> 02:34:00,576
Is something that they're putting out visually if not

3135
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:03,904
I think they're smarter about it they don't

3136
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,696
Call out the white part of it

3137
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:08,512
Cuz I think I think maybe they're segment producer

3138
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:11,328
Elysee try not to

3139
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:16,960
Definitely fine

3140
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:17,984
Plenty of

3141
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,008
Racist dog whistle

3142
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:20,544
No doubt No Doubt

3143
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:23,872
Nono Intuit

3144
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:25,664
No that is

3145
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:29,504
That is totally true

3146
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,272
It would

3147
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:31,552
Without the rest

3148
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:32,832
The

3149
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,112
The idea that like

3150
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:36,416
We Patriots built this

3151
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,744
You said it over it

3152
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:44,352
Built

3153
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:45,120
Look

3154
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:46,400
Pro reparation

3155
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:48,192
100%

3156
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:49,472
I don't know what it looks like

3157
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:51,008
But yeah

3158
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:52,800
Give black people all the money

3159
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:54,592
Michelle and then let's go from there

3160
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:56,128
All right that's why

3161
02:34:56,896 --> 02:35:03,040
I think we need some more nuanced what's our national

3162
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:05,088
Budget like to some trillion dollars

3163
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:06,368
I don't know give it all today

3164
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,648
Listen

3165
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:11,744
So here's here's my I don't like

3166
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,024
Sort of way to transition

3167
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,168
Here's what I will

3168
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:22,752
Here's what else

3169
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,544
As a as a road

3170
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:27,360
And this is something that I find after

3171
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,128
Aftershows all the

3172
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:30,176
Is that old white dudes

3173
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,200
Will come out to me

3174
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:33,504
Hey you were really funny

3175
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
Let me tell you a joke

3176
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:37,088
And then they'll tell me this races

3177
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,368
This joke

3178
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:39,392
Because

3179
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:40,416
They think

3180
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,696
It's a team

3181
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:43,744
Yeah they think the white racism

3182
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:47,072
They don't think

3183
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:49,120
Illicitly that they're being

3184
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,656
Yeah yeah

3185
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,424
Assume

3186
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:52,960
I'd like

3187
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:54,752
Just without even without

3188
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:57,312
Consciously thinking about it they're just like

3189
02:35:57,568 --> 02:35:59,360
Oh you're right you're on my team

3190
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:01,920
I wouldn't say this to my black

3191
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:06,016
Friends cuz we're on the same

3192
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:07,296
Psy

3193
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:10,112
To me what that

3194
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:12,160
Kind of dog whistle eracism is

3195
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:12,928
He doesn't

3196
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:14,208
Even think about it

3197
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,232
It's just

3198
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:18,048
It's just they're just there it's just a suit

3199
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,376
Laughing for the wrong reasons

3200
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:22,656
So many of my

3201
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:27,520
If you if you can and you can hear it too

3202
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:31,872
Like when you tell a joke that you you know is meant to

3203
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:34,432
Lamp and isn't meant to make peace

3204
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:35,968
Feel bad for axle

3205
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:36,736
Believing this

3206
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:38,272
And you get those that

3207
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:40,064
Type of laugh in the wrong way or like

3208
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:42,880
Part of the problem

3209
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:44,416
We got to get to the vet

3210
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,768
Way too far into this

3211
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:52,608
I mean I have to say it

3212
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:57,472
You keep running your mouth your going to run it right in the Six Feet Under

3213
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:01,312
Politically

3214
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:03,616
You should push it much longer

3215
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:08,480
From your actions

3216
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:10,528
You're going to get knocked upside your head

3217
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:18,720
Until you find out

3218
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,768
She had got

3219
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,840
Get the horse

3220
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:28,448
There's no pleasure in killing

3221
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:37,920
Just letting God f****** name is happening

3222
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:42,016
Bitching

3223
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,832
You want that rite of passage

3224
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:46,624
You want to piss

3225
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:48,160
On your battery

3226
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,744
Criminal energy

3227
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:53,280
I know

3228
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,400
Keep pushing

3229
02:37:59,168 --> 02:37:59,680
Because

3230
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:00,704
Watch

3231
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:06,848
You passed the demarcation line once you gone past the point of return

3232
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:08,896
Once you hit the Event Horizon

3233
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:10,944
Just remember

3234
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,224
You asked for it

3235
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:15,808
If you start a war

3236
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,392
It's one that we will finish make no mistake dumbasses

3237
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:27,840
Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in New York on the air

3238
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,864
Call

3239
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,888
Terrifying

3240
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,936
It's it sympathy

3241
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:33,216
But it's terrifying

3242
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:34,240
I took my headphones

3243
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,008
YouTube

3244
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:37,056
You got yours

3245
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:37,824
Moment there

3246
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:42,688
I can't breathe I really can't take a step back

3247
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,968
Allow you to breathe

3248
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:45,504
Please

3249
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,272
That's a desk

3250
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:48,064
Like

3251
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:49,088
Yeah

3252
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,112
That's enough

3253
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,648
Heath

3254
02:38:51,904 --> 02:38:52,672
Heath

3255
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,560
No I know it ain't into him

3256
02:38:58,816 --> 02:38:59,584
Acting like that

3257
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,376
I mean first of all

3258
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,144
Tons

3259
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:03,168
Hunt

3260
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:03,936
Of racism

3261
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:05,728
What is the same antonym

3262
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:08,032
But at the same time

3263
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,568
Goes back to the beginning

3264
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,104
He shook

3265
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:14,176
Yeah he would not be saying these sorts of things

3266
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:15,968
If it wasn't coming from places

3267
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:19,552
Yeah he knows he's a cornered rat

3268
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:23,648
Yeah that's what the lawsuits stuff is catching up to him and he's realizing

3269
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,184
Is firing of Comey

3270
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:31,584
Is going to backfire real hard

3271
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:33,376
But you know like

3272
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:34,912
Is whole thing is

3273
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:39,520
I started this morning

3274
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:41,312
Tuesday

3275
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:43,360
Wednesday

3276
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:46,432
I started Wednesday

3277
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:47,456
Really

3278
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:50,016
I know terrible mood about

3279
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:51,552
The firing of Kalma

3280
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:56,672
At 10 a.m.

3281
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:58,720
Finally was like

3282
02:39:58,976 --> 02:39:59,744
I support this

3283
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:00,512
Decision

3284
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:01,792
It was

3285
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:02,816
It was the most

3286
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:04,096
Depressing it was like

3287
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:05,376
It was like waking up

3288
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:06,656
And somebody saying

3289
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,448
Oh by the way democracy

3290
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,216
Percy is over

3291
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:12,288
I'm still worried about that

3292
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:15,104
Hearing this episode

3293
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:17,408
Made me feel a lot better

3294
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,200
Because

3295
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:20,992
I don't think

3296
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:22,528
This

3297
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:24,320
Exudes

3298
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:29,696
I don't think

3299
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:31,232
You're right into me

3300
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:32,512
When your enemy

3301
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:35,072
Is pathetically spouting

3302
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:37,888
Hatred

3303
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:38,912
And fear

3304
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,472
Gloating

3305
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:43,776
About the idea that one of his enemies

3306
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:44,544
Has gone down

3307
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:47,360
That was not most of the show

3308
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:49,152
I don't think you did any glow.

3309
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:51,712
Other

3310
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:54,016
Yeah other than thing called me is weird

3311
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:58,880
And it's good that he got fired compromised

3312
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:01,440
But even that wasn't globulin that was

3313
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:02,976
Global

3314
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:15,264
When I listen to this

3315
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,800
Globalizing

3316
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:21,920
It's going to be shity but

3317
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:22,944
You know some

3318
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:23,712
Something that we don't

3319
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:26,784
And I think he knows is that a lot of

3320
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:28,576
Big trouble

3321
02:41:30,624 --> 02:41:31,136
We'll see

3322
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,464
It's kind of unfortunate

3323
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:36,000
The show might be in trouble

3324
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:38,304
Ears ears

3325
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:40,864
The thing

3326
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:44,448
Restart Explorer periods of his life

3327
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,752
But the rats leave the ship

3328
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:50,336
Like you're absolutely right they're going to Rebel media

3329
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:52,640
Yeah they're going

3330
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:56,736
But we don't have to immediately start covering them we can just go back to

3331
02:41:56,992 --> 02:42:00,576
Like the good old days

3332
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,856
May 11th

3333
02:42:02,112 --> 02:42:03,136
Right we could go back

3334
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:04,928
May 11th 2013

3335
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:09,792
And do the show everyday

3336
02:42:10,048 --> 02:42:11,840
We could just do that

3337
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:16,448
Let's Retreat inside our own reality

3338
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:21,312
I'm sorry I'm for that I'm not against it so listen

3339
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:22,336
If I could

3340
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:23,872
The guy just did that

3341
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,176
American people

3342
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,248
I would say

3343
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:30,784
Jones is

3344
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:32,832
Incredibly afraid right now

3345
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:34,112
And it's very sad

3346
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:35,904
He's lashing out

3347
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:37,440
That's pretty funny

3348
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:38,208
I'm sad that

3349
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,488
He feels like he needs

3350
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:41,792
T-shirt sales up

3351
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:43,328
I would say razor

3352
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:48,960
It's a tiny bit if you're charging 60 bucks for a bottle of some of your pills

3353
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:52,032
8 bucks for 95

3354
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:54,080
At least

3355
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:57,152
You're going to get more out of

3356
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:59,968
Selling them at

3357
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:02,528
For a penny in for a

3358
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:04,064
Got your dumbass list

3359
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,112
Exact

3360
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:10,464
Exact just as a businessman what are you f******

3361
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:13,024
Which supposedly

3362
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,096
Currently snow not just that

3363
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:17,120
He is a good business

3364
02:43:17,632 --> 02:43:18,912
Since he's turned his

3365
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,448
Lyzette

3366
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:23,520
Bulshit variety hour into

3367
02:43:23,776 --> 02:43:24,288
Meteor

3368
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,312
Borderline

3369
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,128
The odds are that someone behind the scenes

3370
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,480
Did it for 24 years

3371
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:34,272
Before that that's without doing

3372
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:35,808
Extra

3373
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:38,112
Guys has been super fun

3374
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:40,928
Scary right now but please

3375
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:42,208
