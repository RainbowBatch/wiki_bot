Have you seen that they're starting to f*** around with that Reese's egg format

10

Seamlessly

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Susceptible to authoritarian

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,264
I listened to the episode with rags and the whole time every time you did a transition I was like

36
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872

Gotcha from the 25th of March to the 31st of March

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
And

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Aggressive

00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Play bad stuff that's going on this week

57
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Great fantastic

58
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
All right you might have seen a lot of

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
Stop the news about Alex Jones this week with him

60
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't know

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Well but I read the other day that was awesome

62
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Some overlap

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
Stories about like let's say Alex Jones

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Comparing the park

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Little kids to Nazis

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
Worse

67
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Everyone's ignoring

68
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Much like last week

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Weather report

70
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,559
He has said that whites were being exterminated in Rhodesia and

71
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Attention

72
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,447
Could be most compared to the Nazis are the Israeli government

73
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
Subway

74
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,711
Thanks Israel

75
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Not to be believed

76
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Hey

77
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
Definitely not mad about murdered over and over and over again

78
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
Weird weird how they would react negative

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Don't know everything about

80
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Very long console

81
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
But I would posit

82
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
Taylor's oldest time

83
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
I would say the even if the Israeli line

84
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Shooting protesters

85
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Was

86
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Wrecked

87
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Donut saying that it is

88
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,559
Bad Optics should be like

89
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
Oh boy

90
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
Test from a year ago

91
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Wizard wizard actually

92
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Are you sure wasn't like rock salt

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Have a gun at somebody else's

94
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
I'm going to consider that shoot

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
It's not right

96
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
But also everyone's always.

97
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Today we're drinking IBC

98
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
A nice red wine out of

99
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
Sonoma County which is close to where you were over the gation total wine, Napa

100
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,823
What not interested you know what I like wine I don't want to stop and taste wine

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
I've been there it's not that interested

102
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,991
The Scott Brothers grapes

103
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,855
And some other stuff happens when you get drunk

104
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Part 1

105
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
There we go

106
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Who starts

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
March 25th

108
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
And on the Sunday show Alex

109
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Who's hosting with Owen Shroyer

110
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
For a little while

111
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,591
Theater disappear for whatever reason any left Owen

112
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,479
So we won't be discussing too much have went Owens gone start something on this episode

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
That is really fascinating and goes through the entire week

114
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,927
And that is he talks about how much like the

115
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,303
Halloween Hitler hat

116
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
Absolutely

117
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871

118
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,783
Mom hotel at Six Flags

119
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
Whenever filter

I love Beth

121
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
011

122
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Quotes

123
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
Also

124
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
Two high five in 4 minutes I love that Mama.

125
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
Love you

126
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Also

127
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
I look

128
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
I'm not saying

129
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
You can't be friends with

130
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Alex Jones's daughter

131
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Sure they're lovely

132
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
You are

133
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Being taken to Six Flags

134
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
With Alex Jones

135
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
You have to be the most miserable person

136
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Six Flags

137
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
I was friends with a lot of people who would look at that

138
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
Not necessarily

139
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Maybe some people who support the

140
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
The Confederacy actually all of them

141
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,007
Missouri Brewery outside

142
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
The bigger cities now there's a lot of

143
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Very pro-confederate

144
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Trouble

145
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
Batteries

146
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Six Flags my man

147
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
Multi-ethnic people and a lot of the Yoke that you use

148
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
The young people as he explains in his neck

149
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Clip

150
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Conservative

151
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
Generations

152
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
Audiology that's the next wave is like their final

153
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,759
The Establishment was the NRA The Establishment was the conservative

154
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
So also on this show enjoy your suggest

155
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
But it's just a phase

156
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Cars that David Hogg is going through and rebelling and whatever

157
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
You have no heart if you're not a conservative when you're old and you have no brain

158
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,751
Right

159
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,591
Really love protecting money

160
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:56,479
That's not really even the stat

161
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
Maybe he's drawing on

162
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Shown that

163
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Most of the young

164
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
People are

165
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Trying to become

166
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Unaffiliated with party

167
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Maybe because

168
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,375
They attribute all of climate change and income inequality to both parties

169
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
The entire baby boomer generation

170
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Who have f*****

171
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
The world over

172
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Smart thinking

173
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,271
I was trying to study by the British marketing firm called

174
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
The Guild

175
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Gild

176
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:42,559
Also what we talked about blofeld was he

177
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
I mean it's not it's just clunky

178
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Pacific methodology

179
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Z from their study

180
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
People who looked into it and she'll be like

181
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Either way you got other data

182
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Could not possibly lead to a representative

183
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Example

184
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,295
Survey the people take on the internet stuff like that

185
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
There's literally no answer

186
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,927
The questions were asked in a very biased way

187
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
People are paid

188
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
I think these were just like open

189
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Like almost like Facebook

190
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,935
Quizzes

191
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Proposed

192
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
We're biased which everyone knows

193
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Statistics

194
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Advice results

195
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
So even

196
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
The American

197
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
Conservative publication wrote article about that

198
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
And in that article

199
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
They talked about the guild

200
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Understudy

201
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Even they have to admit this

202
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
And I quote

203
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
On the other hand Northwestern University shows the Generation Z is about as likely to support gay marriage and government involved

204
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Lumberton Health Care is millennials

205
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
Add more likely to support transgender right

206
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
Atheism Rises by 5 percentage points among generation

207
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
Despite promising signs of increasing religiosity

208
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
Teenagers are taking a less traditional approach

209
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Christianity than previous generation

210
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
Christianity is also garbage

211
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,831
Now I rather Huffington Post article that cites this Guild study

212
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Great

213
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
Findings from other study

214
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,631
A recent study that they sight shows that 18% of Millennials go to church but 41% of generation

215
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Members do

216
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
Most of them

217
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,431
That's not that's mean

218
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
Decided to eight out of ten members of generations

219
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Considers himself

220
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,087
Fiscally conservative to which I would reply most

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
High school or college

222
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
Let alone I haven't had real jobs

223
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,119
They don't really understand what the economy is all about

224
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Also

225
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
They were sucking little children very impressionable children during the worst downturn in modern

226
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
History in 2008/2009 in a probably

227
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,943
Impression on them watching their parents lose all their money

228
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Understand a certain amount of

229
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Perception

230
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,671
Of fiscal conservatism what you don't understand what that actually means

231
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,511
If your parents are in anyway

232
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Giving you that b*******

233
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
You're like

234
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
Well the government should be run like my family is

235
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
And if we don't have enough money

236
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Then what we do is we

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Tighten our belts

238
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
That whole thing

239
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
And that makes sense if you are

240
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
A bigger picture makes perfect

241
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
I'm also on porch

242
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Problematic for this conclusion the generation

243
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Envy is going work

244
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Conservative

245
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Post article

246
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
But 75% of generation

247
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Envy members

248
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
Support gay marriage and its 76%

249
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Concerned about climate

250
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
So

251
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,727
Well that's just the number that is about this point

252
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Even if you're 9 years old you're like Cheese's

253
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Make it to 20

254
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
I felt that way too but that was just because I was at traumatized

255
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
At this point

256
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Taking away all that stuff

257
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Your assessment is probably the most

258
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
That the generator

259
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Regency folks

260
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
The shoe label

261
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Much more than

262
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Previous generations

263
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
In the same way that they support transgender rights

264
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Permeability

265
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Of people to

266
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Define themselves however they see

267
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
Apply that same

268
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Logic to the political Spectrum

269
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Conservative

270
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Anyway

271
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
It is next clip Owen Shroyer

272
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Imagine

273
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
People who believe that bipartisanship is the way to go

274
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,607
I don't think they're like

275
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
We'll get to make it 2:30

276
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
That's our generation

277
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,335
Really soft version of the the loss of idealism of 6

278
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,151
6th generation absolutely

279
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
BFDI

280
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,623
No maybe we saw a blueprint for how did not cooperate

281
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,719
Succeeded and instead of doing that the Democrats were like maybe

282
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Even larger

283
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
That's true I'm is next clip

284
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Owen Shroyer says something

285
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
That ends up kicking off

286
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
The

287
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Event of the entire neck

288
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Is very important

289
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
There's a void right now Alex and David Hall can easily be defeated we need to find a high-school student

290
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
I was in a car

291
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
With six girls today

292
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
Way more.

293
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
Guns don't kill

294
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
A conservative that's all you wanted to feed a chicken neck Nelly

295
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
It is present somebody that's an alpha male that's all you do what do you think the youth is going to do

296
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,495
Or pick some guy who's the captain of the football team

297
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
So

298
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
History correctly

299
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,063
It's generous an 80s movie

300
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
David Hogg

301
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Is a chicken neck

302
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Nerd you need a bully

303
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
The trick to defeating these people

304
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
Is to be monstrous

305
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Into the probilling camp

306
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
I honestly think it on

307
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Might

308
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
Unironically agree with absolutely

309
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
David Hogg

310
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Seated right

311
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
That's your plan

312
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Well

313
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
A teenager

314
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
Punching down little b******

315
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
Well I mean you got to you got to consider the worldview that they are espousing and what they actually believe

316
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Even that is that Soros

317
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
And his people

318
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
Are scripting David Hogg

319
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Redhead groom Tim

320
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Which introduces

321
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Incredible problem

322
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Becky was

323
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
Recording video during the school shooting

324
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Talking

325
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Two people

326
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
In his class

327
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
So

328
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
If they would have had to groom him

329
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,927
The school shooting slant the school shooter

330
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
Is pushing that narrative one of the logical conclusion

331
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
It has to come from it is

332
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,655
That he believes was fake and set up by the global absolutely cowardly.

333
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,471
Like people saying you believe that

334
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Unscripted by the globalist

335
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Again

336
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:27,455
Like I said there's really literally no way for that to be the case without it happening before the school shooting

337
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
Which what do I say

338
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
Literally every school

339
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
Has somebody who was Gru right

340
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Because

341
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,815
We all know what school shooting is going to happen that's another that's another possible outcome of the red

342
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Possibly say that

343
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
That is called Forever

344
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
You have to plant

345
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Schools

346
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,943
Columbia Missouri 100000

347
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
People going to college with him session or not

348
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
We had

349
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
For high school

350
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
High School Chicago hat

351
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
High School's New York has New York

352
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
If you would have

353
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
To have someone

354
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,751
Pre-planned and position ready to go and

355
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,079
Mysteriously none of these kids have spoken out after like

356
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Hey you know I was put in a position where I could

357
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
Could have been even consider that

358
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Either the

359
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
Every school shooting

360
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,231
Is a false flag invalidate that whole argument you are still calling them prices

361
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Or

362
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,887
You are saying that they and everybody else realize that school shootings are random

363
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Problem

364
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Migrate

365
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Google outcome of that conversation that isn't f******

366
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Stupid

367
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Proving that

368
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
F******

369
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
Stupid it's all very dumb but most

370
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Important

371
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,319
Is their own young hot

372
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
Person

373
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
To fight back

374
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,695
Against David Hogg

375
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
And we'll see where they're nervous or whatever

376
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
That plays out but now we go to

377
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
March 26th

378
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Alex wants

379
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
To talk some more

380
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
About going to Six Flags

381
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
Antonio

382
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Also Ted Nugent ends up showing up on 10 later shows but I can listen to it

383
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
I only bring this up because I ate bears

384
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Mentioning Alex Jones

385
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Ted Nugent

Talk about San Antonio

388
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
That means

389
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
I cannot

390
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Not think about

391
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
How

392
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
Ted Nugent has said on stage

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
San Antonio

394
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
So

395
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Anyway

396
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Good work

397
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,615
This weekend I took my daughter's in some of their friend

398
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
Which car do you want to be in there

399
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
She's baby

400
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,623
Hotel Riverwalk at Six Flags

401
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Play Randy ages

402
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Got mob in Six Flags

403
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
I got my outside I particularly had

404
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Particular

405
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Buster's

406
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
I saw the video you shot today

407
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
I'll check it out

408
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
What do we do if they're really making a move

409
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
Feel so good

410
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,656
Those people Adam

411
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,032
I know what to do I don't know what to do you know don't know what to do

412
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,408
SRP

413
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Alright

414
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Don't need to bring that into stick

415
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Six Flags that energy

416
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
People just like to go for the ranch

417
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Screaming at

418
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
White-collar Hispanic

419
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Great way to go into an amusement park

420
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,472
Negative energy

421
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,336
God so far how do you feel about this Six Flags

422
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Dollightful

423
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
I think

424
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,992
The person who gets Google Alerts about what Alex Jones puts out

425
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Is the status

426
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
Human being in the world

427
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
But that

428
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
I didn't do anything to

429
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
But sometimes I'll get updates on my phone from YouTube

430
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Broadcasting live

431
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,192
But yeah these other people they don't

432
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Google algorithm really is great

433
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Rentastic stuff

434
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Outside of

435
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
Ouch

436
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,808
Everybody everybody

437
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
It doesn't

438
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,672
It's not real though but at least it's pretty on track

439
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
The stories are similar and everything

440
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,304
White people are not mob

441
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,424
Bro only Mart multi-ethnic people

442
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
Minorities

443
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,568
He knows that you know it isn't saying that

444
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Minorities would talk to him at all

445
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Mexican guy looked

446
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Yeah we got a Tuesday

447
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
He told fix bike story

448
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
With six girls

449
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
He said it was 5 or so

450
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
The daughter in Pfeiffer

451
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
You don't walk out

452
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Bowling

453
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,968
By the teachers and people

454
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
Walkout

455
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Organize

456
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Two of the girls by the leaders

457
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
They're only freshmen they're already

458
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Stop.

459
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
14

460
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
And you're super smart

461
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,336
They look like supermodel

462
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Was Dynamite

463
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
This trip isn't.

464
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Supermodel

465
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
1314

466
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Alex

467
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Look at those kids

468
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
The Clippers are done but

469
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
You can already tell that Alex is in

470
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
Internalized Owen Shroyer

471
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Suggested

472
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Girls come on air

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
People that right

474
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
People that are against

475
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,848
The wheels are turning in his head look like

476
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
It's a good idea

477
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
And those girls that wasn't prompting that I was sitting there

478
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,080
Listen to loud music and stop I'll listen to him

479
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
Hungry hungry

480
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Hungry

481
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Well good luck

482
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Funded by George Soros

483
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Red-blooded devices

484
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
What is a worth

485
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:18,496
Oh my God I thought they were conservative and then I gave him a

486
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,848
See little girls

487
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
The fuc

488
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,712
So if you are if you are Soros

489
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
In his world

490
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Absolutely

491
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
That's the way you got to do is that was actually think it was happening

492
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,816
Here they're like I would use my own daughter

493
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
But that would make my ex-wife get it

494
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
I don't know if you've been following

495
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
What's happening

496
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,872
Alex's ex-wife

497
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
Disconcerting

498
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
As we've narrative plays out but just

499
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
Know that year on March 27th

500
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,600
Alex is like I want to use my own daughter but I can't cuz my

501
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Get mad

502
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Which is important

503
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Anyway now we go to March 28th

504
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Which is

505
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Alex

506
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Tell the

507
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
Current kind of story about going to Six Flags

508
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,472
How many Chicken Express the owner was a western

509
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
Thank you

510
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
Broadcast

511
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,976
Interesting Lee I did a bunch of research this week

512
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,888
I read your piece on how many radio stations actually carry Alex and it is

513
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
32 less than advertised

514
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
United States play Alex Jones an only about

515
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
I think it was 6

516
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
American Life

517
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,272
The other a lot of the other ones are him at midnight to 3 a.m.

518
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Right sort of shift

519
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
He has almost no exposure on

520
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Radio terrestrial radio

521
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
He pretends it is very large

522
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,792
You can go to our website knowledge feit.com and find the the right up with all the proof

523
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Send links and stuff on that

524
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Butts

525
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,472
Suffice it to say what I did is I went through every radio Market

526
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,920
Eli's well

527
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
Sound

528
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Radio markets in the United

529
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
I found all of the broadcast

530
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Enzo's Market

531
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
270 miles outside of town

532
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,168
Is a pretty reasonable estimate of how far a normal radio station would travel

533
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,032
Can't leave again

534
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,640
No this was a delight

535
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,480
Waterworks

536
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
This is called research

537
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Fact-finding

538
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,416
I went through all of these radio stations found their schedules and found

539
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Skyrim

540
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,280
I still played a little bit of this week

541
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,216
Anyway the point value with my legitimate

542
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Concern concerns are legit

543
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,592
It was exhausting process go through

544
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,784
More people would Guam could every single article about Alex

545
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Uses his own

546
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Any Zone claims

547
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Like whenever you hear something about Alex it'll say

548
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Without

549
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Variation base little bi

550
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,328
He's on 100 am and FM station

551
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Around the corner

552
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,680
They'll just use his own thing without ever looking into it

553
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
And I think that's

554
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Good I can get the problem

555
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
I can demonstrate that it's not true

556
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,664
Never have

557
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,272
Like you are the only person I can think of who is actually like

558
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
How many stations he is on willing to put up with the mind-numbing chore going through

559
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,000
Which is understandable why they would just be like

560
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,400
I'll just take his word for it in Texas that Alex is on his name

561
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Amarillo

562
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
Am 940 kixz

563
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
He's on Monday through Friday at midday

564
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,384
So the idea that this guy is a listener

565
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
Yes we listening online and he owns

566
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
The chicken joint

567
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,064
I don't know how that's possible you might like be aware of who Alex's

568
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Probably not a normal listener

569
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,184
How to dress to get back to the circle put a button on anxiety I was worried that I might have missed

570
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Spoken

571
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
But I was able to find them

572
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
The country that are Alex

573
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Eight of them broadcasters show live

574
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
Ten of them broadcast him after 9

575
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
P.m. including

576
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
Most of those being

577
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Midnight to overnight

578
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,312
Yeah cuz they couldn't afford syndication of coast to coast

579
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
Essentially what he's doing is

580
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,968
Well that's why you broadcaster shortwave radio also

581
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,600
Yep they're also three breaker Alex nine

582
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,416
And eight of the 32 stations emanate from

583
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Cities with population

584
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Lower than 5,000 people

585
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
And probably don't have the strength

586
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Text to hip normalcy

587
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,144
Like largest city also is not on in Austin

588
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,192
As far as I can tell he always says that he's on

589
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
590 a.m. KLBJ

590
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
But he is not

591
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
That's all to save it

592
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
I don't know I just wanted to bring that up cuz you mentioned thanks to all our affiliates

593
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Yeah thanks to all 32 of them

594
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:53,344
Including only three stations in the country that pinpoint David night

595
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
The country

596
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Plays Owen Shroyer

597
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Oh yeah

598
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
What station is that that's the one that's in Elmhurst Illinois

599
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
It's the one that sells

600
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
It's the one that's owned by Matt do ba

601
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,056
Who's that timer

602
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
And so you know

603
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,504
If you look at the real world version of Alex's reach

604
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
It's all online

605
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
And that's what I wanted to bring up

606
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
When we talked about like

607
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,720
Alex treating his YouTube channel being taken away as an ex

608
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Existential threat to

609
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
The first

610
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
Existential threat exactly

611
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
In the in the

612
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,264
Investment World USA he's not Diversified

613
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,152
Because what he has is that Shoreway for truckers right which is a very limited market

614
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
He has

615
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
Did the online platform

616
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,320
Through Facebook and through YouTube which could be taken away from him

617
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
32 Station

618
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
If he was band

619
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
From YouTube and Facebook

620
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,512
He would he would go away

621
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
He would

622
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:10,144
It would be more conservative he would have almost

623
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,448
No penetration to large markets

624
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
The large audience

625
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Does the people to run his ass

626
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
But he absolutely would be

627
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Crippled by

628
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
He would turn it he would go full Lenny Bruce

629
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
At that point

630
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,808
My plate is your plate first amendment by my Victim right all that stuff but it would be an interesting transformation

631
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Ibid inter

632
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Seeing what happened

633
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
But

634
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
Even knowing all of this

635
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
I still

636
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
I'm not advocating for Alex.

637
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
To be kicked off YouTube

638
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
42b kicked off Facebook

639
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
If it happened

640
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
Not going to defend him on a 1st Amendment

641
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Fart

642
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,056
The people who are like

643
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
That

644
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
I just think there's better ways to attack him

645
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,968
Mabley pointing out that he has almost no radio station

646
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
Talking about

647
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
He keeps claiming

648
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,464
He's on there I did not reach out to any of these stations cuz I was like I've already I've done

649
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
To watch looking

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Irib Institution Ohio

651
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Would be like

652
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Hey

653
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
No we don't

654
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
Please stop saying that would they send

655
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
Would that be possible I don't know cuz I I don't

656
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
He doesn't say it very often

657
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
I can't pinpoint the last time

658
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Reset it but I know that I've heard him say it about

659
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Like

660
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
There was an instance where Darren mcbreen

661
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
And

662
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
The other reporter

663
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
They were out on on

664
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Assignment

665
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Trying to get it fixed

666
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,792
About how the police bought a new boat

667
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Or something like that

668
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
It's a huge scope

669
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,912
And they got hassled by them

670
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Right

671
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
But again I don't know

672
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
LOL

673
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Desist would do

674
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,880
I don't know if you'd have to bet you wouldn't have to make an on-air apology

675
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Alex

676
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
You know what it is

677
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
I've never claimed it our audiences

678
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
Anything compared to Alex

679
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
I've never claimed we are big

680
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
Or anything like that because we're a modest show and I appreciate our listeners greatly but it's not like we're taking over the world

681
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
Yes very small business

682
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,784
Discounted rate

683
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,160
Probably a lot less

684
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
The things that gets in my craw

685
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,280
Is that Alex is so caught up in his masculinity

686
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
And everything is like I'm much bigger than

687
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,936
He's got roughly 2 billion

688
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
He's running a commercial currently where he's at

689
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:00,384
Conservatively 10% of the world listens to him

690
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,760
60 million people absolutely first of all if you break that demographically people who have access

691
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
The internet

692
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Google count the China

693
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
Accounts for

694
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,232
A whole lot of the world's population

695
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,376
Not a lot of our listening to probably.

696
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Of the world's population

697
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Under the age

698
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
It's just

699
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
It's cockamamie.

700
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
10% of the United

701
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
It's just

702
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
It's lunacy

703
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:34,944
Huge in Venice

704
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Acoustic

705
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
It bent me out of shape

706
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
I was so motivated

707
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
I'll look into it

708
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Is because it really bothers

709
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
When people over egg

710
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
Exaggerate

711
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Very important

712
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,144
Clearly

713
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
Because that's what's going on

714
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Here there is like I have to present myself as being

715
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,056
100-200 radio

716
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
When

717
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm on

718
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Stocking

719
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,712
32 including 1 in

720
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,808
Tioga North Dakota population 1230

721
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,648
Including Loris South Carolina population 2000

722
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
396

723
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
I'm loving this including

724
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
Delta Utah population

725
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
3436

726
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Kind of

727
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
Well I mean I did the costume

728
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,520
Beatbox

729
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
Anyway fuckyourself Alex

730
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
I say that

731
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Save that in

732
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Recognition that I know what

733
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,016
Here's the next clip this one is also from March

734
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
27

735
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Pretty mad at David Hogg

736
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
And then I we get to

737
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
See where this is

738
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
Over the course of the week Alex's narrative is pivoted from I hate this stupid March for our lives

739
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
To little bit

740
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Couple days later he's like

741
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,760
Darren mcbreen told me that David Hogg was wearing an armband

742
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
Matt Redman a little bit later in the week

743
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,024
He decides to bring into the narrative that David Hogg didn't

744
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Heel click

745
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Noi

746
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Dissolute

747
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
50

748
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Interpretation

749
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Soft a little bit.

750
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,432
David Hogg narrative that involves over the course of the week

751
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,528
Any luck if you meant that you would have just started where you went you know you wouldn't have like

752
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
Mad about this but I don't have anything

753
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,672
Complain about her choices

754
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
There's a ton of noncom

755
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
An armband

756
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
Their lives

757
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Wiiware

758
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
Pink ribbon for breast cancer

759
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
The real thing

760
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
That's fine

761
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Anyway

762
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
I'm allowed to say that

763
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
My son

764
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
Tell me this morning

765
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
No

766
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
Oh you know

767
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
Couple Junction

768
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,104
We talked to lawyers right judge on that but they're not

769
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
Constitutional

770
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
50

771
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Anthony

772
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Sup

773
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,504
Ecology like the people who leave Scientology

774
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
What time I looked on the internet

775
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,232
Alex Jones's kid was allowed to read the regular internet

776
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,072
Don't know if it would matter

777
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Because

778
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,656
He's been brought up by Alec

779
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
And like you've been doing reports

780
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
About other stuff

781
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:49,152
What's a past global warming one whose dad was

782
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
Leader of a white supremacist

783
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Who looked into it and was like

784
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,648
This is bad

785
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
The hope that that would be some of the end

786
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,280
Result I want to be clear

787
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,584
I know that you and I have slightly different

788
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Views on this

789
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
Because of our texting but

790
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
I believe

791
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
That no matter what Rex

792
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
Is doing he is off limits

793
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
For criticism

794
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
Because I

795
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Speed

796
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
What's happening

797
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Exploitation

798
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
I absolutely see

799
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
His behavior is being

800
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
With a kid

801
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
From a chaotic

802
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
/ abusive home situation

803
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
Right where he is trying to

804
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
Exactly what the authority figure wants

805
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Seem to be

806
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
And generally speaking

807
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
When kids

808
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Do that sort of thing

809
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Because they

810
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
Have an ingrained belief that if I become what

811
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,056
This authority figure wants me to be

812
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,151
All of a sudden these feelings that I have about being deprived ignored

813
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Whatever will go away

814
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
And that's a misguided

815
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Heart of therapy

816
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
John Dewey

817
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
Alex Jones kid

818
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
Could become a

819
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Great comedian

820
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Because daddy issues

821
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,607
Huge thing as long as you get out of work

822
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
I struggle with this greatly

823
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Because

824
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
Where we are right now in the events of the last week

825
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Necessitate the

826
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
To talk about this

827
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
But at the same time

828
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
I'm still not ready

829
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
And it never will be ready

830
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
To criticize

831
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
Rec for his behave

832
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
You know I

833
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,511
We we did talk about that and I did have a different take on it and the more I think about it the more it is

834
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,559
Just the same thing as

835
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Alex being like David Hogg

836
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,423
Pencil Neck

837
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
Whatever whatever it is along those lines it

838
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,311
When you're an adult and you're like this

839
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Stupid

840
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
What are you doing

841
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Right what are you f******

842
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,199
Well there's that

843
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Was never going to

844
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,503
To be good for Alex

845
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Absolutely

846
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
Because he's putting him out as would I would

847
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Describe it as

848
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
You put him out of the lightning

849
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
Whether or not

850
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
In his

851
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
Intense desire to make Alex

852
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Believe in him

853
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
And congratulate him or whatever the

854
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
Particular flavor is

855
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
It whether or not Rex thinks

856
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Is choice or not

857
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Alex is using him as

858
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Kind of

859
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Deflection

860
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,831
Like when I was when I was that age

861
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
To get my father's approval

862
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,439
I got so involved

863
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
The levels that were on

864
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,655
Fashionable because I thought it would be like everything will be okay when I first went to college

865
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Became a religious Studies major

866
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
Because I wanted to follow in my dad's footsteps

867
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
I've somehow I kind and let me be clear my dad was not abusive

868
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
Or anything like that

869
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
He was just

870
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
Withholding

871
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
Yep you have to assume

872
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
There's some sort of

873
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:16,255
Worst version of that in the the home to older brothers and one younger sister and

874
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,071
I was given of course made me feel like

875
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
Well if I

876
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
That I will I will receive that

877
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,031
Attention if my dad will treat me with this kind of level of

878
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
Respect

879
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,895
Don't treat me like a person

880
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
I'm projecting

881
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Anything onto Rec

882
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
I just

883
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
I totally

884
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,135
Okay Rex I understand

885
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,023
I believe in you from my will escape this eventually everything I've been able to glean from

886
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,327
Alex's Behavior both on and off air

887
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
Things I know about him from research

888
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
And that sort of thing

889
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Thought that

890
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
This is

891
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
More or less

892
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
What's going on

893
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Can you imagine

894
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
How

895
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Like

896
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,783
This is one of the things about Alex that I think would be worse

897
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Is a

898
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
If Rex

899
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Was

900
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,719
134 radio station

901
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,583
Oh my God.

902
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,215
I'm so over the course of the last week before this Alex and put up a video that had racks on

903
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Kelly

904
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Alex's ex-wife

905
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
I got in touch with YouTube

906
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
And have them take it down

907
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
Because I don't know cuz he hates

908
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,455
Well I don't know the full text

909
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Store anything of their Court

910
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Proceedings and their divorce and cuss

911
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Debridement

912
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Because I

913
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
You can't I don't care

914
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
But according to her there is a

915
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Injunction that the judge

916
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
Made the tracks in supposed to be on air

917
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
See the miner could cause

918
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
He's being interjected

919
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
To a very

920
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Aggressive

921
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Public

922
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
You know like

923
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
When we talked about it a couple

924
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Months and months

925
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,663
Alex had a report that wrecks

926
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
When he was

927
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,015
We was talking about global warming

928
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Hanging stuff like that

929
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
And to me that's not

930
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
A defensive it's bad

931
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
I'm not for it

932
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
But it's not nearly as a fence

933
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Is this because

934
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
You put your kid into

935
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
Incredibly dangerous

936
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Disposition

937
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
When you inject him into this

938
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Gun debate

939
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
And you injecting on the side

940
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Like

941
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
I know that Alex

942
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,055
Isn't saying that these people are crisis actors literally

943
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,615
But he is insinuating that

944
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
What does 15 year old

945
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
Into that world on the side of things

946
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
You can't possibly understand

947
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
Along with all the

948
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
You know 80 somatic

949
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Implication

950
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,671
The globalist narratives that Alex Jones pushes

951
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Completely lying about

952
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,791
All that's when you do that you put him in danger

953
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
You put him at least you're not

954
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Texting your juice

955
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Unacceptable

956
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,287
It's absolutely unacceptable but the reason Alex is doing it

957
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Is 1

958
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
Because Owen Shroyer

959
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
On Sunday

960
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,687
Said we need our own version of a high-schooler to fight back

961
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Yeah I'm second

962
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Because Kelly

963
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Got one of his videos removed

964
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
And because Alex is a f***

965
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Child

966
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
He's doubling down

967
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Oh

968
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Yeah

969
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
You know what Rick being on air

970
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
He's going to be on aeroflot

971
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
And if I can

972
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Advice

973
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
Don't listen to God damn

974
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,751
Owen Shroyer says if you're taking ideas from him

975
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:45,151
We've given you a million times better than one radio station

976
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
So anyway in his next clip we jump to

977
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
The 30th

978
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Is the 29th

979
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Does not

980
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Not all that fruitful

981
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
High For This

982
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
This.

983
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
Until we go

984
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Where Alex is at

985
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
This morning

986
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
His offer Easter

987
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,967
There's One Direction

988
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
I see George Soros

989
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,079
Isn't terrible

990
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Had to go out and

991
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
Interview people on the street

992
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
This is all about

993
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,951
He's comparing himself to Soros there as well

994
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
Like if Sorrows gets to use people why can't I

995
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,143
And that's that actually touches on one of my reasoning

996
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
We're not attacking

997
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Inasmuch as

998
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Alex

999
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,591
And everyone in that world attacks David Hogg

1000
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
It doesn't make it okay for us to

1001
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Rationalizing

1002
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
His faults version of

1003
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Soros's using it

1004
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,135
A child why can't I that's really bad

1005
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
That's it that's it

1006
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,999
Better exploitative mindset to have

1007
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,303
Now I would also posit

1008
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
That

1009
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
From everything I can tell

1010
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
David Hawkins acting out of his own volition

1011
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
His friends got

1012
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
F****** murdered

1013
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
School

1014
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,335
So that puts him in a position where he was thrust into

1015
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
The national conversation

1016
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Right

1017
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,455
17 as opposed

1018
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
215 which

1019
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Like a

1020
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
Small Potatoes

1021
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
Huge huge

1022
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Potatoes

1023
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
I think I think it is

1024
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:10,047
I think it is but I could understand why someone would say it's kind of a thin lopping

1025
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
To draw but I do think it matters

1026
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,703
I think the beginning of High School versus the end is relevant

1027
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Beyond that

1028
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
How hairy your pets are

1029
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
The other thing too

1030
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
In the past when we seen Alex Jones's kids

1031
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
Pop-up on Infowars

1032
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,279
The times are exactly his narrative

1033
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Or

1034
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,911
Him doing that video with his daughters that was super transphobic where he pretended

1035
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
How to be a dog

1036
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Really

1037
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
If there was a history of

1038
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,871
Life's a George Soros making David Hogg

1039
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
A subject of those sorts of things

1040
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,759
In the past I might feel differently about David Hogs Behavior

1041
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Right that's possible

1042
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
I'm just trying to find ways to

1043
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Like

1044
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Frame this

1045
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
It's very difficult

1046
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
It's very difficult

1047
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
To come down on

1048
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,559
Come down on exactly what the problem is

1049
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
Is it is

1050
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
In and of itself

1051
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
Putting your child out

1052
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,007
As a as an advocate

1053
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
4

1054
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
The worst

1055
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Abuse

1056
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
Like. The only thing that I would say it was

1057
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,503
He's doing that

1058
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
I give

1059
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
At Markham

1060
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Really

1061
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
To that argument that I think

1062
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
That

1063
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
I mean Alex Munoz he's a liar and a propaganda

1064
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,583
But his son may actually think that what he's doing is right

1065
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
He might not think

1066
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
He's a part of

1067
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
The worst

1068
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
Right to that gives

1069
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
Absolutely

1070
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
Hartke doesn't

1071
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,895
The level of bullying

1072
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,455
A child gets online from

1073
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,551
You know being alive compared to the level of bullying

1074
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
You better child like

1075
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
I like Rex

1076
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
We get for is getting

1077
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
From

1078
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,767
Is is

1079
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,071
Brutal

1080
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,655
You and I can't possibly

1081
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
When we were fourteen we didn't have that level of

1082
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Social media

1083
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
AOL Instant Messenger

1084
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:36,735
You know that was already like Facebook was the Facebook when I was in college

1085
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,343
Like maybe Myspace or Friendster exist

1086
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,903
When I was younger and I was not on

1087
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Amazon

1088
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Yeah

1089
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
The amount of

1090
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Pressure

1091
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
And

1092
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,167
And being judged

1093
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
It comes from

1094
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:01,567
Articles being written about you in Daily Mail Right

1095
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
I don't

1096
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,663
Think like what what is what is 50

1097
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:10,783
Freshman in high school well as we all know like just like any child

1098
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
You wind up

1099
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Fine

1100
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:18,463
Right from that development

1101
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
At all

1102
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
SMS

1103
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
The drinking problem he is going to have

1104
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
What is going to be a star

1105
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Well special is alcoholism

1106
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,519
So it is next clip by Alex G but how you can't criticize

1107
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
David Hogg

1108
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
You're not allowed to

1109
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,151
Twitter Facebook

1110
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
Criticize

1111
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
Dirty

1112
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Play

1113
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,231
Images of Mary Jane

1114
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
I hope Michael Buffer Suzhou right on that

1115
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
Adele

1116
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
Next Level stuff

1117
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,671
You know what you can criticize David Hogg

1118
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,815
If you disagree with his principal if you disagree with his

1119
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Principal live

1120
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
You disagree with what he

1121
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Are the

1122
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
Solutions to the issue

1123
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
You're not disagree

1124
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
With David Hogg

1125
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,871
David Hart

1126
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,687
The person calling him

1127
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Maze

1128
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
What the f***

1129
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Child

1130
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
And

1131
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:52,159
Creating elaborate conspiracy theories around a 17-0 like

1132
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,487
To the point where like none of its proven that you can't prove

1133
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,791
Single goddamn things

1134
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
And

1135
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,863
He's embellishing all of the things like

1136
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,959
There's that video that came out where David Hogg was talked about like politics

1137
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
A f*** about us

1138
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:10,079
Stuff like that whenever Alex

1139
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
Play Oregon

1140
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
You're lying about a child

1141
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
And again

1142
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
I think it's

1143
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
You went to school with David Hogg

1144
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
You would be suspended

1145
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,927
That's at least you would get a sternly worded talk

1146
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Perhaps

1147
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,791
Forgiveness comes down to Alex's beliefs

1148
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,351
David Hogg isn't acting of his own volition

1149
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,655
He is he is a globalist puppet

1150
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
Witchy spells out in the

1151
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,431
I should take that's not Alex speaking for himself he's quoting an article I believe in the Austin american-statesman

1152
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
Yeah so that's not his own words

1153
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
But in order for me to have had this

1154
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:55,391
This clip include him explaining that you'll be like a minute and a half longer

1155
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,183
Have nothing

1156
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,303
Yeah you can get a career

1157
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407
Hell yes.

1158
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
Yep you nailed it

1159
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,927
Sick life

1160
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:36,863
Bricklayers Midland

1161
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,679
Justice bottom feeders

1162
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Even

1163
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
Texas

1164
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,799
He's going to be is

1165
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Even if you was groom

1166
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:50,175
Even if he is a puppet deserve sympathy

1167
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,503
I'm not your violent attacks are used

1168
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Suggesting

1169
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,319
Even in such a world

1170
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
Where he was groomed

1171
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,671
Shooting he deserves sympathy

1172
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,463
Yes

1173
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:09,119
Yeah human being in that scenario which isn't the real

1174
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,263
Then he's as much as a victim as lexic

1175
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,103
Because he didn't know a shooting was going to happen

1176
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,663
He was just planted there by the globalist

1177
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,991
Every made and even even if he was groomed for it

1178
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
A shooting still have

1179
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,135
I was pretty thrilled to shooting the messenger

1180
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Conclusion and

1181
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,071
Action that Alex Jones has taken

1182
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Only incriminates him more

1183
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Even if

1184
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:49,055
Is living in the real world even if his version of stuff is Right still bad behavior still

1185
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,871
I'm suing this next clip

1186
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
This is Brazil in March 30th

1187
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
Which

1188
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Is

1189
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
Believe that was Friday

1190
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
I do

1191
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Where's that leave you a

1192
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,743
We're still in the 30-year and this next clip we get to

1193
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
Feed

1194
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Alex talking about the

1195
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
The Providence

1196
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,607
Of rex's

1197
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Material

1198
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
He said something in here that he thinks

1199
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,799
I don't like it when he uses the word I used it

1200
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Sexy wife

1201
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,407
Alex says something's that is

1202
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Sort of

1203
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
To save

1204
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
Like

1205
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
He's doing that

1206
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
But accidentally

1207
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
You kind of reviews

1208
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,543
My wife are they cloud

1209
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
He's a man now

1210
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,575
Still

1211
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,559
He understood the talk last night

1212
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,423
Use a condom when you f*** a globalist

1213
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,215
He wants to go down this road

1214
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,079
How did Gladiator win the fight for liberty

1215
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,639
Que maldicion nice gentleman

1216
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:34,271
Newspapers

1217
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
They don't like

1218
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
My son 15

1219
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
A few ideas I had

1220
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
That's sad

1221
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Two ideas

1222
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Nordstrom

1223
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
Even if

1224
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
20%

1225
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Does Alex

1226
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
Spiritually

1227
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Cyborg

1228
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
So

1229
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,615
I don't know I don't I don't believe it's a really good argument

1230
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
He's doing it

1231
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,599
Jewish Jewish people have a Mitzvah at 13 but even they are not there like

1232
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,415
Yeah

1233
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
We're having a party

1234
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
You're still not allowed to make your own

1235
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
It's something of a Rite of Passage

1236
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,351
But you're still develop

1237
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
Mentally not

1238
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
Whenever everybody lived

1239
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,543
You're halfway home

1240
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
Alex's

1241
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
Just talkin about how

1242
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
Excited

1243
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
This video

1244
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
The Friday the 30th

1245
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,807
Show sort of wines down

1246
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
Marisol

1247
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
Gross

1248
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,655
Back to this really quick I would argue that Alex's near exist

1249
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
Yeah you know like your living evidence

1250
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
Right now that you can do

1251
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
Right so go f*** yourself

1252
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
Warthog

1253
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,511
Love you guys so much but I want to be able to go to our gas

1254
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,583
I want to play that so I want to get that new video

1255
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
Legally

1256
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,775
No

1257
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,759
Where he says basically

1258
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
And why are you responding and why are you calling the first men

1259
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Sounds like Alex

1260
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
Call Ford

1261
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Hosta

1262
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
It's just a word

1263
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
Really feels like Alex

1264
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,271
Cuz not in character they're so much as

1265
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,367
Psychodrama

1266
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:22,463
This is a whole lot of mess yeah

1267
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,791
So where you at Whitwell

1268
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:32,447
Calling for the cancellation of Laura Ingraham show is not the same thing as pointing out to sponsors of her show

1269
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Do that

1270
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,031
She's a monster and maybe you don't want to be associate

1271
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:42,175
That's that's not quite the end result might be she gets dropped from the network is sponsor

1272
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
Don't want to get behind it but that

1273
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
That's pretty much okay

1274
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,111
That's how the market works

1275
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Sponsors staying behind who they

1276
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
5

1277
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
Not

1278
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,631
And if someone that's that's kind of how

1279
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,215
Your show Alex is kind of heavy Overton window

1280
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,007
In terms of mass media should

1281
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
Maybe

1282
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,055
Maybe I don't actually

1283
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,615
This is how it should be enforced

1284
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
To some degree is like

1285
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,455
Is this something we can get away with

1286
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
Supporting without losing our bottom line

1287
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,087
That sure seems like the least

1288
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
Vet Canby.

1289
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
Blake is this something that week

1290
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,999
Can get away with is not necessarily A ringing endorsement

1291
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
The capitalist

1292
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,167
Is Mexico a Latin

1293
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Is the last one

1294
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
From the 30th

1295
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,007
And it's Alex reinforcing the idea that

1296
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Dude

1297
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
This was Rex's idea

1298
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,943
I forgot you also sings along with country music at the beginning

1299
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,559
I guess it was Wednesday night Tuesday night Nisha said man that is hog jobs

1300
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,751
Debate

1301
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,359
The real quick the timeline of

1302
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
The David Hogg did say you wanted

1303
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,479
Bait Alex but then he gave an interview

1304
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,111
Know anything about Alex and I started to realize

1305
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Yeah which is a very rational

1306
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,959
This morning I got up at 6 a.m.

1307
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,983
6 a.m.

1308
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
He wanted you to do

1309
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311
Did you before school

1310
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
Rabbit over

1311
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
Is is that

1312
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:34,207
All the Publications are coming out saying in the same article I talked about hog

1313
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,767
Express my son into politics

1314
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,351
A terrible father

1315
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
That that that has done this

1316
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,775
Alex Jones turns his fifteen-year-old son to defend them from bullying

1317
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
By David Hogg

1318
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
So

1319
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
Headlines

1320
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
Any

1321
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,247
Way I agree

1322
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
And anyway if you if you agree with that

1323
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
Petillo riffic headlight

1324
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:07,743
That at that email ostensibly

1325
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Support

1326
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Alex

1327
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
They are a garbage

1328
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
Group of Public Aid

1329
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:20,543
Certainly a result of Articles like that is only furthering exploitation that Alex

1330
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Subjecting his son to

1331
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
Like they're there is a journalist

1332
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:27,199
Ethic I believe that don't

1333
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,527
Yeah and the only reason we were poor idealistic

1334
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,391
Well the only reason we're doing this is because of what we're about to talk about because

1335
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:44,095
We're a podcast about Alex Jones taken up a lot of the last week and it would be remiss of us

1336
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Discuss it

1337
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
In the way that we

1338
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
We discuss out

1339
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
It's not like again I mean

1340
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,519
Stress it over and over again

1341
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,847
I've anything but pity and empathy for 4 right

1342
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,455
Again if David Hogg were a tool of the globalist

1343
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,783
We would have the same level of pity and empathy for that

1344
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,879
Spoiler alert I have a lot of sympathy for him as is

1345
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,159
Yeah

1346
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Yeah I mentioned

1347
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
What my life would have been like

1348
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Had at

1349
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
16 or 7

1350
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
I was

1351
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
In the position of

1352
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Leaving

1353
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Spokesman

1354
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,751
Leaning

1355
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
Participating in one

1356
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,151
But leaving a movement that all of the adults I know

1357
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Are unable to

1358
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,807
And you have some people who are on your side you know somebody else who are like

1359
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
I get it

1360
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
I get it reflects things up

1361
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
See what you can do

1362
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
I know there's some people are like

1363
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,767
Globalist

1364
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,863
Be difficult cuz one Creator like

1365
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,983
Do the adults are like you go ahead and take care of this pressure

1366
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,591
And then there's the abuse that comes from

1367
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
The globalists

1368
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,175
And

1369
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
That world

1370
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,503
I can't imagine

1371
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
Have literally

1372
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,951
All of this s*** to these children

1373
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
It's not like we talked about

1374
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
So many times

1375
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
There are no adults

1376
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,679
Does a backup

1377
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,775
People

1378
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,615
Doing their job belts are coming but only if we all

1379
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,943
Call Mama.

1380
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
Just going to happen

1381
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:43,647
What is Generation Z

1382
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Probably true blue Jordan now we getting

1383
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
I'm trying to not talk

1384
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,959
Alex went into the studio on Saturday

1385
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
On 31st

1386
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Okay Special Report

1387
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
I'm not liking

1388
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,895
The first one single Special Report we've ever

1389
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Recovered has been the worst thing I've ever

1390
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,527
Is probably worse than the first one first one

1391
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
So

1392
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Paul Joseph Watson

1393
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
You found

1394
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,463
A Reddit account

1395
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
Is David Hogg

1396
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,071
I really think you're wrong

1397
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,607
It's possible that he's not

1398
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
I don't care

1399
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,167
I'm already on the he's wrong tip

1400
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,775
If Alex confirm something absolutely not

1401
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,823
Alex

1402
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,639
Confirmed it was literally impossible

1403
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:41,503
Reddit isn't a person first off first off and second off they don't give out that information

1404
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
It's illegal

1405
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
Illegal for them to do so

1406
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
I mean Reddit

1407
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,975
At its core outside of like when people get doc

1408
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
And stuff like that

1409
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
It's a community that

1410
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,839
A hundred percent based around a nativity

1411
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
They wouldn't

1412
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Give that information up to

1413
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:02,239
Weirdo alt-right a****** from Britain

1414
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
I'll be that as it may

1415
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,383
The story that he's pitching is about how David Hogg made a joke

1416
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
In 27

1417
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Eonon Reddit

Reddit Thread about what Miss

1422
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
Mosquitoes water positive things

1423
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
It was for them to exist

1424
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,047
And our account

1425
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,887
Write more people than anything else and so Alex is at the point of almost

1426
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,983
Crying about their about like it as evidence that like

1427
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
He's clearly lying about

1428
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:42,687
Caring about a school shooting when he's making a joke about mosquitoes killing millions of people

1429
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:49,087
John P holdren book ecoscience which he's lying about on the global

1431
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
Literally the beginning of it that

01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
Mosquitoes

1448
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
Crazy fear that people have

1449
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423

1453
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,311
Malaria is more effective

1454
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,383
1294 it's very treatable

1455
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,647

From the endgame

1472
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,407

That's again anytime Alex says I did

1484
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Absolutely did it feels very uncomfortable

1485
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,879
4-bolt there are multiple points in it where Rex

1486
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,927
Is literally repeating Alex Jones

1487
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
Narratives that he has no business

1488
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Being inter

1489
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,815

Complains about any clips of him talk

1492
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,031
Cuz I I believe it that's it

1493
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
Inappropriate

1494
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
But at one point

1495
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
We are in agreement

1496
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,431
Complaining about

01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Salon

1498
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,479
Cuz there was an article in

1499
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
Salon about how he's been brainwashed

1500
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,575

Making these claim

1503
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,927
And about how she's concerned

1504
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,975
It's not

1505
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,047

Also

01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,727

01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
Any part of that I only bring that up because he's complaining about the law

1515
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,599
Organization to normalize pedophilia

1516
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
Alex Jones normative

1517
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
And

1518
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
It's

1519
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Articles

1520
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
That were written

1521
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
In 2050

1522
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
Team fire guy name

1523
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
Todd Nickerson

1524
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,887
We've been over this

1525
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Yeah but he was

1526
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
12 Windows key

1527
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,031
There's legitimately no reason you should be reading salon at 12

1528
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,591
Right

1529
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Cling to his dad

1530
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,895
Because it's misrepresent

1531
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
Taste of reality

1532
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,479
Exactly in the same way that Alex.

1533
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
There's a bunch

1534
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
Point where it's

1535
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
Clear that he's doing an Alex

1536
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
There's a bunch of

1537
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
Things that are

1538
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
Either literally

1539
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
Or very close to Alex catchphrase

1540
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Really really

1541
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,607
Stabbed so f****** f***** up

1542
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,143
Thanks comfortable

1543
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Yeah

1544
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
That's a bummer

1545
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,751
Comfortable is there's a park

1546
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Towards the end of

1547
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,543
Special Report

1548
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
Where Alex

1549
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
Is trying to prove

1550
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,919
That it's not scripted and there's no teleprompter

1551
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223
Syrex is sitting at the desk

1552
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
And the camera

1553
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
Hands over

1554
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
And Alex is standing which would be watching

1555
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Yeah

1556
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
He clearly has a

1557
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,607
Isn't that isn't supportive

1558
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,167
It's it's just it's just a glass

1559
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Disposable cups

1560
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
The same way

1561
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,287
See them drink out of in the past

1562
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
So many times on the show

1563
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Faces

1564
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:04,479
You can make the argument that

1565
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,551
Well this next clip should do some of those

1566
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
And keep in mind

1567
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Well you're listening to this

1568
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,183
F****** stupid ass

1569
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
Very clearly drunk Alex

1570
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
His son is there

1571
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
Sitting right next

1572
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
Silicon shop

1573
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
So good

1574
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
30 yd

1575
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Coco

1576
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
Colt Python

1577
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:45,183
I mean that is

1578
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,255
Dog show you that now me doing that kind of stuff

1579
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,631
That's what I'm doing baby I'm boom

1580
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,655
Talk like that

1581
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:58,495
You know if you got it

1582
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
And the people claimed that my Americana

1583
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
Straight-shooting

1584
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,711
Holy Temple in all this crap

1585
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,271
YouTube the establishment's why you're so successful

1586
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
The whole control left

1587
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,367
Is so pathetic

1588
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,439
And so scared and so

1589
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:21,279
Free movies.com

1590
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,631
We're going to put you up on TV

1591
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,215
Criticize that we're going to be

1592
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,007
And I'm private jets with George Soros

1593
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
Bring a private jet around here my son was mad

1594
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
Heat

1595
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,663
I took took my daughters

1596
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
About their friends to Six Flags

1597
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Wow

1598
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,575
That's not what I

1599
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647
Sad

1600
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,743
The only reason that I deemed it necessary for us

1601
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
To even

1602
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,559
Dip into these Waters

1603
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
I think

1604
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Alex adjust

1605
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,983
Posted a video where Rex was like

1606
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:08,383
I'm a kid two or something like that if you like this is f***** up but I like and we can get past this and the sake of DC

1607
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,991
Escalated to the point where he on his day off

1608
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,295
Brought his son into the studio and was

1609
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Drunk

1610
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,855
Wow they did a f******

1611
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,927
Video about how I'm not forcing you into this

1612
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,719
And Rex

1613
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,535
Repeated a bunch of Alex Jones narrative talking points

1614
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,143
Like it's beyond the point where we can sit back and not be like

1615
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
This is

1616
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,191
Crazy

1617
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,471
This is me

1618
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,055
On the level of Alex Jones Behavior it

1619
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
This is next

1620
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Level

1621
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,871
Really

1622
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,919
What type of ship in the in the

1623
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,199
Shittown that I grew up

1624
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,295
This is the type of s*** that I would hear from my friends who lived

1625
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,575
Been there in the country

1626
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:53,439
Enter data

1627
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,207
Thrown around

1628
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
The word it like

1629
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,255
14

1630
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
Not Looking Back

1631
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,655
Your dad would sit around the fire with his three Buddies

1632
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
And they would be

1633
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,727
Drunk just saying the worst

1634
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
And you're right there

1635
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
Any rain next

1636
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:15,199
The story of light bulbs

1637
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,271
Whenever all my friends there and they laughed as I as I

1638
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
As I drink all of this

1639
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
Your likes

1640
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,671
That's cool when I'm twelve and now as an adult some like

1641
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,207
Text fuckedupshit

1642
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,255
Fuckedupshit

1643
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,887
It's not treating a child as a individual now

1644
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,935
Yeah and that's a really damaged

1645
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
Park

1646
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,079
You can do severe damage to and upbringing

1647
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
Cuz

1648
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,639
The process of becoming

1649
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,687
Adult involved individuation

1650
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Involve separation anxiety

1651
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,807
Look into like

1652
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
Can talk about the various crises

1653
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
You're supposed to go through

1654
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
As you mature

1655
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
I don't I don't sit here

1656
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
Say anything.

1657
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,583
The effect of Alex.

1658
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Love his son

1659
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
Or anything like that

1660
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
I'm not

1661
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
That is what I am saying

1662
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,983
Is that

1663
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
The way he's

1664
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Treating him

1665
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
He's a prop

1666
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
He's not a child

1667
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,128
Yeah it's on

1668
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,920
He's not that's not okay

1669
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,688
Is a thing

1670
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Italics

1671
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:27,392
From everything that I've noticed of Kelly's Behavior

1672
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Ron Twitter

1673
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,952
I don't fully support her either

1674
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
But I think she's much better than Alex

1675
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,168
Just by virtue of

1676
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:43,008
Simplistic explanation but I go even deeper than that

1677
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,592
Recognize that a lot of the

1678
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Complained

1679
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,384
She's making about

1680
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Are things that have existed

1681
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
Since

1682
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,992
She was a part of it

1683
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,344
Infowars

1684
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
LLC

1685
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,744
OU spits out this hateful rhetoric of a

1686
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,536
Like he was doing that in 2014

1687
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,304
When you guys were married

1688
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,608
If you were a part of the business you didn't have a

1689
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
F****** problem with a backpack

1690
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
Now granted

1691
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
You can change

1692
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
And I accept that

1693
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,056
But I also I also see your posting stuff about like

1694
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,336
She knows

1695
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
About Rodger Stone

1696
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,944
Cambridge analytica in Russian business

1697
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,016
And we know from investigating 2015

1698
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
Timeline doesn't work

1699
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,320
She divorced Alex

1700
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
It's Beginning

1701
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,904
2015 Rodger Stone didn't show up

1702
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Till November

1703
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
There's not

1704
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,256
There's not behind-the-scenes information

1705
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
Can chicken have about

1706
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Alex

1707
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
Liking Trump cuz he didn't

1708
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,704
Immediately showed up right until December 20th

1709
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,752
A behind-the-scenes information

1710
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
She can have about

1711
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
The business dealings

1712
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,848
Which I imagine

1713
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
She does not want

1714
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
No

1715
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,224
But she wants to pretend that she has information about stuff the people want to hear about

1716
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
Mutually exclusive

1717
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,856
Try not have that information

1718
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,904
I don't either

1719
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Family Show

1720
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,976
Exactly. A f***** up fam

1721
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Your

1722
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,816
That's f******

1723
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,544
On the issues about Kelly I'm saying I support her in a

1724
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
As much as

1725
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,592
I do believe that

1726
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:27,456
She was mistreated and what have you playing things

1727
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,736
Plays right into Alex

1728
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,064
Because she's pretending that she has information that

1729
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,648
No I don't want you to believe that

1730
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
Pretending to have information

1731
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
But you can't pause

1732
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,768
Implies that Alex is a Russian

1733
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
Something like that in reality

1734
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
He's not a Russian agent

1735
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,912
Comes out invalidate

1736
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,192
It works against

1737
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
Like she legitimately the other day posted

1738
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
A picture of Alex

1739
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,568
Having a Russian

1740
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
A Russian

1741
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,408
He posted this picture on

1742
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Twitter

1743
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
They got f***

1744
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,784
Ron Perlman retweeted

1745
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,320
Great but you know what

1746
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,648
On February 1st 2018

1747
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,720
That place was first tweeted by Daria

1748
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,024
Infowars employee Daria

1749
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
As a prank

1750
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,096
It was a troll picture

1751
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
That she reposted

1752
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,704
As if it's somehow proves that Alex works for Russia

1753
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:26,592
No we are trying to work towards

1754
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
That bums me out but I

1755
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
Don't think she's probably a better parent

1756
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,480
Conflicted

1757
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
I don't know what

1758
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
It's like you said

1759
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
Family s***

1760
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:41,952
We shouldn't be involved in any of that but as we are a deeply and intimately involved with Alec

1761
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,744
We can't ignore this

1762
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,536
At the same time

1763
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
If we're only talking about Alex

1764
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,888
In context of all this stuff insane

1765
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Kelly gets a free

1766
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Pass

1767
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,216
I don't think that's fair either

1768
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
So

1769
01:23:55,264 --> 01:24:00,640
Nothing I got nothing no this is f***** up that's my response to all of this is like

1770
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
Thank God I'm not wreck

1771
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,248
Well thank God

1772
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,040
Immediately after that last clip

1773
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,832
Alex told you stories again

1774
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
Heat

1775
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,464
I took took my daughters

1776
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
About their friends to Six Flags

1777
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
My wife was in one car

1778
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
Babies

1779
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
Unrecognizable

1780
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
Older daughter again

1781
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
Farmer Fran

1782
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,936
I thought

1783
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
I thought Ted Nugent

1784
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:30,336
Are these girls were like

1785
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
Who I was

1786
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
Wasn't

1787
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,456
They were dial.

1788
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,320
And they were all from your high school

1789
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,904
That's what I'm getting at is globalist

1790
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,952
And those girls

1791
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
We're both hurting

1792
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,536
Smart beautiful intelligent

1793
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,960
Then he doesn't have a right to be on here

1794
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
That's brainwashing

1795
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,800
That's deeply upsetting PID

1796
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
He is drinking

1797
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:06,176
Sitting on the air next to his son and being like

1798
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:12,832
What is these girls spoke out loud he's having his fun for him he's discussing the idea of a

1799
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
Better prop

1800
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Yep

1801
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,720
Go f*** yourself seriously

1802
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,792
I regret that we talked about

1803
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,912
I hope this resolves and I wish Rex nothing but the best at

1804
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Immatures

1805
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,472
And grows up I hope that he doesn't

1806
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Too deeply involved

1807
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,312
Good luck kid when you grow up

1808
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,896
God Bless you that's right. You're welcome to have your own position

1809
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:40,224
But I think the idea of beef like

1810
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:46,880
Comedy scene in Austin dude whenever you're ready for a fall again

1811
01:25:55,328 --> 01:26:00,448
Are in one day

1812
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,520
I want this is the crystallized point that I really want to make

1813
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
I don't want to 50

1814
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Senior old ever listen

1815
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,128
Absolutely

1816
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,664
If you consider the

1817
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:13,760
He's been doing Special reports for Alex if he was 12 13

1818
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,064
I don't want any 12 or 13 year old listening

1819
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,624
They do not have the emotional

1820
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Maturity

1821
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
Understand

1822
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,696
Where these ideas

1823
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,464
Come from

1824
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
Cuz some of its kind of attractive

1825
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
Some of its kind of appealing

1826
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
You know this idea when you're a kid

1827
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,144
The world is scary

1828
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
Because there's

1829
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,752
Chaos there's disorder there's like I don't understand why this happened

1830
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:39,104
And what do you have a conspiracy theory that ties everything together in a nice bow

1831
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,176
Oh it's these globalist that are doing everything

1832
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,968
It gives you a shortcut to

1833
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,736
Maturing

1834
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
In some ways

1835
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
But you never asked

1836
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,112
You end up having the appearance

1837
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
More less

1838
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,696
Because you believed you could read college books when you were

1839
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,000
Exactly and if you're curated

1840
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:00,608
Information like if you're if Alex clearly if he's

1841
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,680
He was reading adult books whenever he was 10

1842
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
That is

1843
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Pressure that's put on you

1844
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:12,128
By Alex Alex Alex

1845
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,408
Like let's be

1846
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,176
F******

1847
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,712
Super clear about this

1848
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
That's Alex

1849
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
Reading Rec

1850
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
Like

1851
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
You are mean

1852
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,648
Because it's the exact same language to use it

1853
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Speak about himself

1854
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:29,536
It's whether or not Rexes

1855
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,816
Yeah I don't give a

1856
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,352
Flying f*** about that

1857
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:35,936
What I do care about is Alex's behavior in the things that you can trace bro

1858
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
When a parent

1859
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,776
He's their child

1860
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,336
Extension of themselves

1861
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,896
As opposed to an individual in an of them

1862
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
Themselves

1863
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,712
What they do is not allow them

1864
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,992
To experience

1865
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,272
Separation

1866
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,552
That individuation

1867
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
So important

1868
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
And upbringing

1869
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Haddad Electric

1870
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,696
Unfortunately

1871
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,464
Pretty clear

1872
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
Based on the way that I would speak

1873
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,048
About him like you bring up with me

1874
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,840
He's reading adult books

1875
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Yep

1876
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,656
That's Alex being like you are me

1877
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Think about all the

1878
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,472
Rhetoric that Alex

1879
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,520
Bentley employees

1880
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,824
I will live on through my kids because

1881
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,640
My ancestors Army

1882
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,688
That is a shortcut

1883
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,224
To mental illness

1884
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,504
Right

1885
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:30,720
What time this weekend so we can do a slightly more fun part 2

1886
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,768
