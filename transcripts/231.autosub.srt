00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey everybody welcome back to college

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,408
Alex Jones

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:21,248
Favorite holiday celebrating

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,856
Thanksgiving

6
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
The showare

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
Unfortunately

8
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
Coverage that was recording

9
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Today

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Because I know a lot about Alex Jones

11
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:03,744
And I only

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,816
I had a holiday with my face and my family

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,752
Check that in the good times

14
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Are there was this

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
Succession of moments where I

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
I wanted to punch my family

17
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
This particular sequence

18
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
My girlfriend

19
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Talked about

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,816
Dental work and how her insurance didn't cover it

21
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
You know they're just in it for the money

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Oh you're saying that for-profit medicine maybe doesn't lead to better patient

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
Mom said that while she was pregnant

24
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
With my little sister

25
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Insurance

26
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Guess what

30
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Situation playing on the way

31
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
Stiff upper lip

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
I did not

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Pretty much right after that

34
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,944
Andrea Cortez

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
She said there were three chambers and immediately after that

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Typo

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696

00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Amman

44
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
Lost my voice

45
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
Where I almost got mad at

46
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
Maybe a good half-hour Chung

47
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
We got to go

48
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Get through this

49
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
Play I apologize I had

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,024
I would go out of sorts

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Actually what

52
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Covered with snow on play

53
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
So awful

54
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
That like

55
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Note adjust itself to that but

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
I went back

57
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
And today we're going to be going over 2000

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592

00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Filled me with joy

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
There were multiple times

62
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Who Ally was

63
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Fantastic

68
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
There was something refreshing

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
A radius alley

70
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
All right there's my guy

00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495

00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567

74
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,407

75
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455

12 hours straight

108
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
Alex is kind of not really understanding

109
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Mason's Tea Party

110
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
We've seen that

111
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663

00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Defensive about it

120
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
I think that's going

121
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
To help him

122
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167

Oh oh no we have to make this look professional

167
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
That's what you call Professional

00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Why the f***

Quicker it would be as flick

172
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
What time is factual inaccuracies

173
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535

You may remember

177
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
I do recall you heard him say

178
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
I want to hear your voice

179
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Severe vomiting

180
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
To which I said

181
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
Slightly different

182
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
Here's the first one

183
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
That's out of calls

184
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,423
A little bit not as hard-hitting unclear what

185
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,543
Hard-hitting

186
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Message

187
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591

00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Still pretty glowing reviews

189
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Slept great

190
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967

You don't like I wanted the first start with The Obama Deception

197
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Definitely enjoyed it

198
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,887
Because I wasn't you so much I can't say that I learn too much but the exciting part

199
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Do I get to meet people

200
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,799
And bring up the alarm to set and then either the Mitt Romney type that we're out here in Las Vegas Nevada

201
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Huge movement out here

202
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
And they already know

203
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
So

204
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
His review is I already knew all this s*** cuz I wasn't but the exciting thing is now I have something

205
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,255
Also the people I talk to about it already know about it is

206
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Greatly dip

207
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
I would talk to them about

208
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Do you know XYZ

209
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Do you think they don't know about

210
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,591
We have a nice little conversation

211
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
Weirdo friend now

212
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Even-keeled

213
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Can I go with you

214
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
Thing that I started to reflect on

215
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Two kinds of Alex Jones callers

216
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
The crazy people be like

217
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
Right right about the past

218
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
Sweet nutjob2 call-in

219
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
And then there are people who are way too

220
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
To prepare

221
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,239
And this guy is one of the vets

222
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Section V Jones's listener

223
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
They know that they can

224
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Use Alex

225
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
The show

226
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
To amplify whatever they want

227
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Answer this guy is calling in to talk about like Las Vegas

228
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,807
It's politics

229
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Really prepared

230
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
Using Alex's show as a bully pulpit

231
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,743
Any starting with the the buttering up

232
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,583
Exactly

233
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Use that strategy

234
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
We hear Alex

235
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Explain why

236
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Which is something I'm Carrie

237
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
But

238
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
In doing so I think he reveals

239
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
The answer to one of the big mister

240
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
But we couldn't get

241
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
To the bottom up

242
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
What is about

243
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Well

244
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
No

245
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
One specific

246
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
I couldn't

247
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,631
The official anthem

248
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Mainline Republicans

249
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,063
Who believed that he secretly Osama bin Laden

250
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
He was born in Kenya

251
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
Weather weather

252
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,071
The media early on shows to make

253
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
Attempt explaining his motivation in making the Obama.

254
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Preemptive

255
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Face on

256
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Sort of beating against Obama

257
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
If it's not a tooth

258
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Hillbilly yelling

259
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Himself as

260
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Do you like

261
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Above it all

262
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Non-partisan

263
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
I don't like this guy

264
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Sucks

265
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
That

266
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
I would say Mission failed

267
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Also your buddy Jerome corsi is one of the ones who's going around in the media talking about Obama being forwarded Kenya

268
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Yeah and your throat

269
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Hey

270
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Anyway

271
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
So that that I think is a failure of an explanation for why you made

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783
Well he starts getting distracted with talking about other things really explained

273
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Any further

274
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
I think you just like I think I can make the money also

275
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Information the Obamas

276
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
He wants to tell the truth

277
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,447
I imagine documentary

278
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
I think it was just

279
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
Maybe he had a ton of blank

280
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Make a DVR disc

281
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
That could be a DVD

282
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
Got to move these things I don't know

283
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Crafts

284
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
Interest like that before we got to the part where I

285
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Sings this song

286
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
A little mystery

287
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
Meanwhile

288
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Americans

289
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Thanks

290
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
Republican Democrat black white Chinese Mexican doesn't matter

291
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Signs for the life of

292
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,215
Anything that indicated a 90% disapproval rating for the Baylor

293
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
That was something that I was

294
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
Completely flummoxed by because

295
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
But they're Alex's brain immediately goes to Congress got thousand

296
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
Call

297
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Presume

298
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,879
Acapulco

299
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Intense love

300
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,559
The people who would call your congressman.

301
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:14,751
But that's also there's so many statistical elements

302
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
Kronos app

303
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
You called me like

304
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,351
Mississippi

305
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Ridiculous

306
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,823
In the documentary he said there were thousand 21 phone calls against

307
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
I imagine

308
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Maybe

309
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Got that

310
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
You can imagine somebody has that that level of

311
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
That makes me feel a little bit better

312
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Oh

313
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Seven things that

314
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
People took away the most

315
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Enjoyment out of

316
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
In the Obama.

317
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Was the moment

318
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Alex

319
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
84 years

320
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
They will destroy Obama in order to bring in

321
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,943
Another puppet

322
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Alex predicting his own future

323
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
Next

324
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
The same thing

325
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
But doesn't even

326
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
More clearly

327
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
It's insane how much you used

328
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Just like this is what I'm going to do

329
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Because they will associate their personal power

330
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Because they see it as their man's doing it

331
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:07,391
Zaywoah

332
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Even complains about data online

333
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
Comments for bit after that

334
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
The key Freight their key phrases that they associate this person with their personal

335
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
Power power behind the Trump movement

336
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
I can understand it's crazy is bananas correctly

337
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Perfect

338
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
But he's not really

339
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
All these dumb people

340
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Stupid

341
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Somebody play that clipboard

342
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,263
Somebody somebody barley giant boombox

343
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
Perfect

344
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
F****** time

345
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
To do a

346
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,039
Christmas Carol with Alex Jones

347
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,815
Ruby so good ghost of Alex present would be him talking to that thirty-year-old would leave a house

348
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Click

349
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
And the ghost

350
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,103
Christmas future is his co-host with one-year-old

351
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,039
This is the future is looking at

352
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
His own with no one around it but

353
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
Jerome corsi prison

354
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,375
Call Lara

355
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Download

356
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Ted Anderson doesn't even come

357
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Have you awesome

358
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Another caller

359
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Another review

360
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
Las Vegas

361
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Ultimately my

362
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Picanha the sound production

363
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Amazing

364
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Thank you very much for

365
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Professionalism and honing your craft

366
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
The reason why I was calling today

367
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,848
Actually had more to do with Marshall out here in Las Vegas Nevada

368
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Get a pumped on that one

369
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
That's all real

370
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Claire mysalad Las Vegas

371
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Steam on the show

372
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
He doesn't laugh

373
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Something else happen

374
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
It's far more important

375
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,768
But yes today is

376
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Those graphics

377
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
There's not a professional

378
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Peoples

379
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
Shiprock

380
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Like I said

381
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
Las Vegas martial law is going to have to take a back burner

382
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Because there's another man I would watch

383
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
The show Las Vegas

384
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Martial law

385
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
That

386
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
Would that be MCA S-Type

387
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
Situation

388
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
The guy's name is Marshall

389
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
I like this Las Vegas and he's got a serious drug problem

390
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Also

391
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Chief of Police

392
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
He stay on the Prairie

393
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
Okay this is now we're in like a

394
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
What do Arlington Jail pay off his gambling

395
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
Something like that

396
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
If the hill

397
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
The federalized

398
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
The Las Vegas Police

399
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,952
Hitman bring in martial law

400
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Exactly

401
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
There's a there's a lot of

402
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,656
Calvin Titus rules bandied about on this show

403
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
All the cold open

404
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
Because the show is actually like Hogan's Heroes

405
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
That

406
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
We got a winner flash-forward after the first season

407
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
You mean

408
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Alright

409
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
I don't want to do it

410
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
I think that's

411
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
So you meets God was a Bart

412
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,656
Martial law

413
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,592
Even though you're in a FEMA camp your Q3 to be federalized though

414
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
That might be a winner of a show

415
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Dude that was

416
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Once we have a little more time

417
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Flush out the beat

418
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
We can shop it around and pilot season

419
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,416
Las Vegas martial law is going to have to wait

420
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
About the show and Alex talked about it as a narrative because

421
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Something else is on Alec

422
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
What does mind

423
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
And it's something we talked about already

424
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Is f****** mind about it on the show and its allies

425
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
High schoolers

426
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,744
18 24s for military and domestic

427
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Military service

428
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
It's just a nice report roll not combat roll

429
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
I mean this is unbelievable and no one is talking about

430
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
No one is talking about it because it

431
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
You're making up

432
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
He's talking about the Department of Defense director

433
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,768
Do 1404. Tend we talk about our Eddie's ats-v

434
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,632
They forced out

435
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
And then the other thing is the HR 1388

436
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
2009

437
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
She's just reading the wrong version of the Bell

438
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
And not the person that ever was in the Senate

439
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,808
Find about this on the show that there's a draft

440
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856
And what I listen to stuff like this actually

441
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Like what

442
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
Started up the episode misses the road he was going down

443
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
What is he going to do when that doesn't

444
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Like how do you do it how do you

445
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,400
There's a f****** draft now it looks

446
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Six months later.

447
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
There still a draft

448
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,824
Clair Shores

449
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
We got that

450
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
Studio goddess

451
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Plastic

452
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
I don't know

453
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Such a big

454
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
You know it gets.

455
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Huge

456
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Easy to be like that

457
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
. that's not

458
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:14,144
He's clearly saying that there is now a draft

459
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
They were just bringing up because nobody else

460
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
Who is sure thing like

461
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,664
Probably would be his eyes Angela

462
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Even though he's pissed off and no one else is covering

463
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
He doesn't want to

464
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Because he wants to take calls

465
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,840
Something else

466
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Taking calls

467
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm just going to sit here

468
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Palmer

469
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
Because preparedness is very important and

470
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,528
He's not having his water filter or sponsor on the show

471
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,392
Confuse long to get to the point

472
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
Direct

473
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Survival food people who actually

474
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Interesting Lee

475
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Bench

476
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
Shapiro now sells survival food

477
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Is the name of the the water filtration

478
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,688
Sponsor

479
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
I know it's really confusing

480
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
Because what it does is it take water out of the air

481
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Like moisture out of the air

482
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Filters

483
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Make a drinkable

484
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,792
But it's really helpful if it works

485
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Don't think it does

486
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,960
Parader

487
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
You. He does talk about how he

488
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
These filters

489
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Play

490
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
If you want one for your whole house

491
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
You know for like

492
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
It's the size of a school

493
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
The shipping cost on that allowed

494
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
They got to do that

495
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
I think that would be

496
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Impossible 4

497
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
For anybody who doesn't live

498
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Completely awful

499
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,080
The grid I don't know I don't know if most people have

500
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
A school bus

501
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Size face

502
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah I put that in

503
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm trying to figure out if we have a room

504
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Now the answer is no

505
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,560
Plus water filter

506
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,960
The shortwave broadcast

507
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Clip

508
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
He's done talking to his water filter guy

509
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
What are you special

510
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
You gets done

511
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
You should have.

512
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Because the next color that he gets

513
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,768
He's a f****** anti-semite

514
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Hey Alex how you doing today buddy

515
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
That's not actually watched about three times I think it's a great film too many times

516
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Personally it just

517
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
Tackles the whole issue of New World Order

518
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
One of the things I want to ask

519
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
I noticed

520
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,904
Citizenship for Israel

521
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Was there a reason that you decided to skip that

522
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,304
The conscious decision on your part

523
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:34,752
What he's talking about is this idea of the right of return

524
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Right of return citizen

525
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
SunChips

526
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
I'm sorry everybody who's Jewish

527
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,552
Can't go to Israel and become a citizen there is that their country that allows that

528
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Not for me is not that people in Obama's cabinet or work for him

529
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
Have dual citizenship

530
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:03,168
Yes by virtue of the fact that

531
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
They are

532
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
54 my hereditary

533
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Deeply f*****-up

534
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
Because that's not like that's not

535
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
These people were all born in Israel

536
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
They moved here and they

537
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
I still think that's a stupid argument but at least

538
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
You be coming from

539
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:28,768
Why doesn't anyone talk about something like that

540
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Extra second

541
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
All

542
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Justice

543
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
I find veneer over saying

544
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
These are Jewish people

545
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
Why are they in position

546
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
In the government

547
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,408
And that's crazy

548
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:50,016
I don't know Mississippi

549
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,112
From somebody

550
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Alex's responses

551
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Talk to me about that little lady think

552
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
This is what happened

553
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,192
With research and literally

554
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,128
We got to get this off

555
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,296
No I meant

556
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:29,696
Install and then how

557
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
How much was cousins

558
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Caring

559
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,096
So he meant to get into that witch suck

560
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Because he's probably just

561
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Lying

562
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
You actually say to anyone who knows what

563
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
What is like

564
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
Just said it was already over

565
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
Whether or not

566
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
To his audio

567
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,208
It's really hard to say I don't know if he's oblivious to the fact that

568
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,792
All this guy is in his cabinet

569
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
Alex should know better

570
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Man

571
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
Until

572
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:22,176
Rightly pointed out the right of return

573
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
It is strange that people from

574
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
It goes on a little bit longer

575
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Do you make some announcement

576
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Hotmail

577
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
For the rest of my

578
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
Approved by the Senate

579
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
Because they're such a

580
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,784
More

581
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576

That might as well

585
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,976
If it's a response to this color that's kind of

586
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
The feeling that it has

587
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
Uwosh so

588
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352

The show is going to make us go back

594
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Who is that

595
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280

The third one

598
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,544
Needle to go back to

599
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Find find the kids

600
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
That lost their whatever

601
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Read a lot of number

602
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,064
6park

603
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,904

Nantucket Obama Deception

608
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
Don't go out

609
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
But

610
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
In addition to that

611
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
He also has some thoughts

612
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
Nicolas Cage

613
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
Okay

614
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,224
I'm actually I'm out here to hear that I'm about it

615
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,784
Raising Arizona

616
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
2009

617
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Alright

618
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,976
Have you had a chance to talk to you about that new Nicolas Cage movie The Knowing that came out have you seen that yet

619
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:20,864
The wicked male I miss a lot of things

620
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
So it fits completely Illuminati hide

621
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
It's about an astrologer

622
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,800
Who stumbles onto a 50-year numerology

623
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Numerology

624
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
All about major disasters and events that are going to happen in the world and basically at the end of the film extinction level

625
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
What happened

626
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,576
Who won the first code that he breaks was 9-11-2001

627
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,672
Latitude longitude

628
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
I mean

629
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
It's it's

630
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
It's not

631
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Okay

632
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,424
This is my favorite so it's probably the hardest I've ever laughed at

633
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,520
Movie theater when this came out and

634
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Maybe I did

635
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,200
The theater whatever the case I saw a screening of it then it was just me and my friends drunk

636
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
The plot of the movie is Nicolas Cage's son goes to

637
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,976
Time capsule

638
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
Nicolas Cage with kid

639
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,608
Gets a big sheet of paper that has a bunch of numbers on

640
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
EXO he gets obsessed

641
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
And he's looking over all these numbers

642
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
I can't crack the code

643
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
Figure out what what's with these numbers

644
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,688
Have them all written on a dry-erase board

645
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Boloco did everything

646
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
It's alive

647
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,808
This shot that made me laugh so hard

648
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Is he sitting there drinking a scotch

649
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
Late night

650
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Darkroom

651
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Drinking a scotch looking at these numbers

652
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Can't figure it out

653
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Glass down

654
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
On the piece of paper that has all the numbers on it

655
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
Picks the glass up to have another drink looks down

656
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,728
There's a glass

657
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:07,616
911 around 9-11-2001

658
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,200
Make me laugh

659
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
That's pretty cool.

660
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:19,648
It flashes to is Hema Googling 911

661
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:31,168
I f****** know those numbers where do I know this

662
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
So that sucks

663
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
That movie is

664
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,800
That's good that's good I like that

665
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Google

666
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
At the end of that

667
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
If not a lot of

668
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
It is

669
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Fantastic

670
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
He fights

671
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,512
Like it starts out very slow and ponderous and they deal with all this stuff

672
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Man on man

673
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
His

674
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Sonic

675
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,664
Extinction level event

676
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,504
Come down and they take Nicolas Cage's

677
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
The daughter of someone else

678
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,600
The school

679
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,256
Weird

680
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Not at all

681
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
You don't

682
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
When you're telling a story a big reveal at the end

683
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Kind of like to give Clues

684
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
I don't know why it was all a dream

685
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
The movie and all that

686
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Nicolas Cage Google what planet

687
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Nicolas Cage

688
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Sacrifice

689
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Play some self-service sunmi

690
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Really

691
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,984
I love that movie that's what I'm so glad

692
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,384
911

693
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
It's not like it's 20 years later either about

694
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
I should tell you

695
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
He's so he gets

696
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Yes

697
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,048
The cup rating on the page 511 2009 1101

698
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
Exactly

699
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,144
Those numbers up on the dry erase board

700
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
How many trucks

701
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,776
He starts breaking them up like it's like 91:10

702
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,736
It's the best it's like

703
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,576
If I were if the writer can come up with

704
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
No

705
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
No

706
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Am I putting that in the movie

707
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Nope

708
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
It stays.

709
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
I'm so glad they did though

710
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
He allowed me to talk about knowing so

711
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
I know we all know

712
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Are you still an answer

713
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Now

714
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
You may remember

715
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
Aways back on the show

716
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,992

I don't know I think Alex was suggesting that he might still be alive

735
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,999
Weeks before this

736
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Too far back

737
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
But

738
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095

Not enough to know whether he's dead or alive

744
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,047
Alright

745
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327

00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
Google service

772
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
911

773
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
But

774
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Cool

775
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
Easy way to keep track of this stuff

776
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
If their government has websites

777
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
The government publishing office

778
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,823
It has a website where they put up every even like

779
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Introduced bill

780
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
And stuff like that

781
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
If you knew about that he could have gone to there and

782
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Sounds

783
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Versions of the bill

784
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Emptying the

785
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Changes that have

786
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,087
Realized

787
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
We can keep track of like all this was

788
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,791
Right now we should committee

789
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,631
A couple days later

790
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,727
All that stuff is a resource that is very available

791
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,055
No idea that that's available which is troubling

792
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Considering in 2009

793
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
He's been on air for

794
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,175
Non-24 years

795
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
That's crazy

796
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Google

797
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
I supposed to mean

798
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Obama Deception level of research

799
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
He does know when a Domino's Pizza

800
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,447
8 pictures

801
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Leading

802
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
His staff

803
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
To Google it and figure out

804
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
What's really going

805
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Infowars

806
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
So he has this guy named Matt

807
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
He's a GOP operative out of Missouri

808
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
This Guy's in Port

809
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
It's not really all that

810
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,511
He works with a anti-abortion

811
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Group

812
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Missouri

813
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,167
He ended up later being one of the guys that would go to

814
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
For Trump

815
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
Great

816
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,407
Added Missouri to the list of states along with mr.

817
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,247
I'm going to take that one on the chin

818
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,855
Who's the guy who they want to after Jeffrey Lord tweeted a bunch of knots

819
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
And then they have to fire him

820
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
So Matt Martin

821
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Let's get this f****** tickle

822
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,839
Good how is Elliot how many guys

823
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,143
Do you need to get to defend Trump

824
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Who gets fired

825
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
I think there might be a pattern

826
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
No no no

827
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,407
13

828
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
Because

829
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Report is

830
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
Cute biggest

831
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Alex's decided because

832
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,815
He's dumb that it's called

833
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
They are

834
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
Hell-bent

835
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
To get an apology

836
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
What Matt Martinez.

837
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
Is he's making

838
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,311
In order to get this retract

839
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
I'm not sure if

840
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Missouri

841
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Me too

842
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Redact

843
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
And so he's on

844
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
I'm very

845
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,415
Episode illustrate

846
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Hypocrisy

847
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Pathetic

848
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Those people

849
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Like him

850
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
A chart to hedges

851
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Interrupt yard group charge to head in

852
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
Very little in common with the ACLU too often

853
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,543
But we went to the ACLU and said you guys

854
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,615
Are supposed to be standing up for civil liberties this is

855
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
An example unless some

856
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Let's use

857
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,735
Your own cloud and the go-ahead of course

858
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
Betraying their true colors we have heard nothing area word from them and they're not

859
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
Assisting in any way

860
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
I don't care if they're helping or not you suck

861
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
So much

862
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,559
If you complain about the ACLU all day long about global is nonsense

863
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
And then when you have a complaint you're like

864
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Hey no one listened

865
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
But they listen to you

866
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
That's real f****** stupid

867
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:50,431
Real stupid come on that's next level

868
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,991
Almost to help pedophiles in

869
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
Demons and whatever

870
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Boo

871
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,207
No no

872
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
No their hypocritical pieces

873
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
Go f******

874
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
Awful

875
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
That's that is

876
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:17,567
Kclu is 100% wrong all of the time they're globalism their people

877
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,687
You're not busy

878
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
Make

879
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
I like you

880
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
You guys are

881
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Vic time

882
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:42,143
Defenders of the downtrodden who don't have any kind of political cloud of Their Own

883
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,727
Is every single time

884
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Because that's what they do

885
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,823
Liberty

886
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,199
Nobody's civil liberties were being encroached upon

887
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,247
Outside

888
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,367
You always talk about the draft

889
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,207
Holidays we have this interview about the miac report to calling us terrorists

890
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
All that stuff

891
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
And his next trip I think

892
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Is one of the most

893
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
Weird it's the weirdest juxta

894
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Deposition

895
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Cuz he's coming back from break

896
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,215
He's trying to make everyone really afraid

897
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
But perhaps

898
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Is bae

899
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Exact opposite

900
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
He would have liked

901
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:46,655
Used Ford Edge

902
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:53,055
Martial law

903
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
Call the Army confirmed

904
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,159
What's going on

905
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,559
Children under Federal control

906
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,263
Through the window

907
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,383
We can be like that

908
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:33,759
That's nuts man I love that set up a better life

909
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
You couldn't set up a better signal that you're f****** with people then to make them Afraid over Don't Fear the Reaper

910
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
So that's

911
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,839
I don't know if you noticed that but that's the second time

912
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
Safari then you talk about the draft

913
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,167
Specifically

914
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:58,591
That's weird and you can't have them getting your women he brings that up over and over and I know that that's probably just because

915
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
Is a theoretical difference

916
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
From the old

917
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
But still

918
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
It feels like

919
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Trying to make people

920
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
The trigger people

921
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
His listeners

922
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Defensive

923
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
I think that's what he's trying to

924
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Register

925
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
I suppose they would

926
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Considerate chivalrous defense

927
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
But in reality it's more like

928
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
Control

929
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,751
That's why almost

930
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,335
You know you should.

931
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
That Stephen

932
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
Shapiro everything out

933
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Sphere this draft bill

934
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
Superior the miac report

935
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
DePere

936
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Obama who's

937
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
Clearly

938
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Oh that's

939
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,927
I'm more afraid of one of those water filters falling

940
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,511
The f****** school.

941
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,815
Waterproof

942
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
The reason that I'm

943
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
You done like 200

944
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
He's very pretty

945
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
He has

946
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Front

947
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
To himself

948
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
A brave space

949
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
He faces adversity

950
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Is the globalist

951
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
At every turn

952
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,415
Court

953
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
He says no

954
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
I will I will need

955
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
Meet you on the battle

956
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,567
Went down a weird Road

957
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Anyways

958
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,639
The point is it Alex's never afraid of

959
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
And the New World Order

960
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Today

961
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Oh no

962
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:46,879
Normally I don't let it get to me

963
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
Listen to this song

964
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
Youth Brigade sportsdrafts tattletail squads

965
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
We don't have a hairline yet

966
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,487
They call it America

967
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,911
I have the bill here in front of me

968
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,239
It's a version of the bill

969
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,311
If he just went to the government publishing office

970
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
It would be so easy

971
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Like you just went

972
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,919
Looked at

973
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,575
That's all portions of the bill later

974
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
Yeah that's

975
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
Crazy how amateurs this is

976
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:01,887
I had to get multiple people working there no one is like hey Alex you're lying you're lying by Omission affect

977
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Does he think

978
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
That

979
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
The if they pass

980
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
Any version

981
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
Annabelle

982
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
All versions of the

983
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Baby

984
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Total

985
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Ignorance about this order

986
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,599
And I should also be clear point out the even if the introduced version of the bill passed it wouldn't create a draft or forced service on it

987
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,183
That's also a misunderstanding

988
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:28,511
The part that says service

989
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
If there is a way

990
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
To set something like that up

991
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
4

992
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,543
Whether it would be helpful or not

993
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
You set up the study find out

994
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
It's not helpful

995
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,991
So you wouldn't do it right

996
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Is just

997
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
It's a little bit about

998
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
You would think that anybody in

999
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
You're going down the road real hard

1000
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
This draft

1001
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Road

1002
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
And it's based on

1003
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
My misunderstanding

1004
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
You should save yourself the trouble of looking

1005
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
Like a dick

1006
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,687
Because he's ever said that to

1007
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,503
Because the version that has that language taken out this is

1008
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Is the 24th

1009
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
At least five days possum

1010
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Before this

1011
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
That languages

1012
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
There's no reason why you shouldn't know that

1013
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,719
So

1014
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,047
We look back on this now like 9 years later and would like

1015
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
Oh wow this is

1016
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
Real indication

1017
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Outrageous

1018
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
Or just

1019
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Worst f***

1020
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,799
And he literally said to the guy

1021
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,359
I don't have time to follow up with

1022
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,687
Biggest story that I am Hamming up

1023
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Busy

1024
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:02,207
I've been busy

1025
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:08,607
The Jews across state lines

1026
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
Well

1027
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
You have

1028
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,263
So in this next break

1029
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
Revivalist minister

1030
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
He is feeling the spear

1031
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,943
My God it's a Vortex of evil

1032
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
And they want your bank account they want your children they want you to the indentured servants

1033
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
You got to get the Obama Deception

1034
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
I was very rousing a

1035
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
No not really

1036
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,687
Another point you was trying to get to with the

1037
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,831
I do like the way he slipped it in the middle

1038
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,679
Mid-level manipulators and Liars

1039
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,983
That if you say what you mean the last

1040
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,799
It's really glaring

1041
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
In that case

1042
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,223
Paul Joseph Watson

1043
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
It's cold in

1044
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,039
He's on the line

1045
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,087
It's a very rare 2009

1046
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
Verbal appearance

1047
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,695
So now you can say that the UK is at

1048
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
List of

1049
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,607

And

1054
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
He has to be the bearer

1055
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
The actual bad

1056
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,639
My God I'm sick of this

Read me the article

1070
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,911
Better than that has the feeling of a play

1071
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,335
Really overact

1072
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
Part of it

1073
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:06,527
Like jumping around from idea to idea flight

1074
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
Yeah

To a great

1078
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,719
And that leads me to think that he doesn't know that it's not address

1079
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
You know we always

1080
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Wonder like

1081
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327

What is the LIE what is the

1083
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
Is is he dumb enough to think that this is

1084
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
Is the draft

1085
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Uno's

1086
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
He knows if it's a

01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
Suggest a visit

01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,151

Documentary

1090
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,967
The Obama Deception

1091
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
Getting people real riled up

1092
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,855
Banking on the fact they won't remember a week from now

1093
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
You've moved on to another narrow

1094
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Did the bill pass

1095
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:53,375
Because so long as they're debating The Belfry you can feel like we're fighting about nothing

1096
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,447
Said that was the most

1097
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:04,383
Belleville bingo

Stupid

1100
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,999
As long as progress with

1101
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Then yeah you can just

1102
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:26,143
Use that forever like he uses the emergency centers at establishment

1103
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,959
2009

1104
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:34,847
Directed at anytime

1105
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
You're right

1106
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
That is that is

1107
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
I had thought about

1108
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
They the factor want surpasses it

1109
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
It's kind of a kind of hurts

1110
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
Casinos it's all bulshit

1111
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
From fake crying

1112
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,887
Now wallmask total slavery it is confirmed

1113
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:05,055
They also aren't omnipresent

1114
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
I have been very upset

1115
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:12,479
Is bad

1116
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,623
Any other cities

1117
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:25,791
Yeah everyone listening as ever listen to the

1118
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,631
The dead authors podcast where Andy Daly plays elrond Hubbard

1119
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
But that right there

1120
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Alex

1121
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,847
Pretending you sad that sounds exactly like

1122
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:46,015
It really sounds exactly like someone

1123
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
Play

1124
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
Yeah that's awesome

1125
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Has no sense

1126
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Tall

1127
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:53,951
It's crazy

1128
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,279
2018

1129
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
About the idea that

1130
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
People calling Donald Trump

1131
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
Hitler or calling

1132
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
People in the alt right

1133
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
That's

1134
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
Especially like

1135
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
Lycra

1136
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,615
He just got into office what you doing

1137
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Now we see

1138
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
Be here

1139
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Parched

1140
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
24th 2000

1141
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,271
Obama's been in office about

1142
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,575
No two months and nine days

1143
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
Here's Alexander

1144
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
I want to commend all of you out there

1145
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,207
Right now

1146
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
God promises

1147
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,335
All the king's horses and all the king's men are together

1148
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:57,951
You look at that man on your screen Barack Obama bat

1149
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,279
Empowering him

1150
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:06,911
You are looking at the next at all

1151
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
He has a spirit

1152
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,383
He has a spirit of deception

1153
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
That was quick

1154
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,479
Yo what did he what did he do

1155
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
He was on the screen

1156
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
Alright

1157
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Okay

1158
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Starting a

1159
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,159
Literally what did the first

1160
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:31,231
Two months didn't misread a bill

1161
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,815
But he didn't know there was the

1162
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
I don't know I don't know

1163
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Right

1164
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,895
He hired Rahm Emanuel

1165
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,295
I think you might take that for different reasons salad

1166
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,647
That's why

1167
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,279
That's scary that's hitleresque

1168
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Hitler had a

1169
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,191
I don't know I can't think of a whole lot else that isn't like

1170
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Erica

1171
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
Bailed out on him

1172
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,735
Misunderstandings that Alex has it could be cleared up

1173
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,271
A little reading

1174
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
Somebody that you don't

1175
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
And start yelling

1176
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
Anyway

1177
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,719
This is the dog

1178
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Recall

1179
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:40,863
Was he laughed so hard

1180
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,447
Know about Israeli citizenship

1181
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
Docket baby lose my s*** and I was like that's one of the reasons why I like

1182
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,431
I'm so glad we listening to the show instead of hell yeah

1183
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
You get the call towards the end of the show

1184
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Hey this is

1185
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
So weird

1186
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
Alex's responds to this guy is

1187
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,159
Possible I have no idea what's going through

1188
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,743
What's going on talk to Jason and Kentucky Jason go ahead

1189
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Hey Alex

1190
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,583
I'm 29 and Mary buddy you're now

1191
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,631
And my wife and I

1192
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,167
Having our first and I'll bring you

1193
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
Baby into this world

1194
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
I know you Liza Morales

1195
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
You have no one

1196
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,103
What

1197
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
What

1198
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
I can't

1199
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,535
Figure out what I think about this call

1200
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,839
Because I think Alex is sussing out that he

1201
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
He's Jason

1202
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
Kentucky he's a white guy

1203
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah so you should have Kik

1204
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
You know what I'm saying like if it was Muhammad

1205
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,615
Florida

1206
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Subscribe

1207
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,455
Yeah I doubt it

1208
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
But I I don't know I think

1209
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
The greater context

1210
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
The call is

1211
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
Jason's mask

1212
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Get bad

1213
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,975
We're think about having kids should we sell

1214
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,351
We're going to be more what

1215
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
But at the same time

1216
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
The way he presume

1217
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
It's a wonderful time

1218
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Whatever rich

1219
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
It's a bad argument

1220
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,687
Because it's just going to get really bad everyone

1221
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,759
Give you value and we're going to have the Food Lion

1222
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
If you were going to turn into

1223
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,415
The summer of Rage

1224
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
Active baby through that

1225
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,255
And a baby isn't really going to experience it

1226
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
Until it's

1227
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
Years old

1228
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:55,519
Should we make it through to the other end and then you die

1229
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,567
Rainbow York you get cannibalize

1230
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:03,199
What if it's a curious case baby comes out

1231
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,991
Baby girls really fat

1232
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,015
Want to talk about

1233
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
This thing is like all of Alex's argument

1234
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,255
That's that that's worth ideas

1235
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,303
A remarkable time to lift

1236
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
After all that stuff

1237
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,399
And the only thing that really feels like Alex

1238
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
He thinks this guy's wife

1239
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,239
And Afraid of the demographic

1240
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
Quit

1241
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
Or anything I can

1242
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
Sure that's fine

1243
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,855
You should shut the f****** about this

1244
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
Alex

1245
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
Then children at Society

1246
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
Tell him to have a family

1247
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
To doing what he does

1248
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:11,039
I got really upset earlier because you just hits me I can't just sit here day after day

1249
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,111
Mega draft for women's well

1250
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,887
I mean you know they're building descamps I mean

1251
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:31,007
This doesn't have to help other people

1252
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,335
It's really

1253
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
I like it's

1254
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
Funny but

1255
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,943
It's so dumb

1256
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Like

1257
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
When you have

1258
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,271
The information

1259
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,599
Reading the wrong version of the bill

1260
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
It's just

1261
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
You look at this music

1262
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Alex

1263
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
What are you even doing

1264
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,767
Did you know women are already in the military

1265
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
He's not into it

1266
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,399
I don't I don't know

1267
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,215
Position

1268
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:05,055
If I had to guess I would say he's probably one of these guys look they shouldn't serve with me

1269
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,759
It feels like you might be on that yet but I'm talking to her

1270
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,807
Yeah that's weird

1271
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
I would be surprised

1272
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
Now if there was a draft that

1273
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Didn't

1274
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
What is there was address

1275
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Stupid awful

1276
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
But if there was I would be shocked

1277
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
Was just a male.

1278
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,751
I think that I'm crazy

1279
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Dismounting

1280
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,711
Is ending the show

1281
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
Kind of really about for him

1282
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Is pageantry of Faking

1283
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Crying

1284
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
Misunderstanding old version of daylight

1285
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:59,327
Busting my butt

1286
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:05,471
And I'm not good

1287
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:12,383
I'm just some average. It's all up to you

1288
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,527
1002

1289
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:24,927
The truth is more powerful in Hawaii

1290
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Literally

1291
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:32,863
I'll tell you I want to fight for freedom

1292
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,911
I doubt you're just an average guy

1293
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,823
But also I'm here to say

1294
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
Pictures does not spread faster

1295
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:51,039
That is not more powerful than the lie in any wars

1296
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,879
Is

1297
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
So powerful

1298
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,695
Stronger

1299
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,231
Then truth propaganda is

1300
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
Incredibly effective

1301
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
When you have

1302
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,327
A dumb assholes putting out of

1303
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
Documentary film

1304
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,727
For Ron Paul's brother says it's three people pass the Federal Reserve Act

1305
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
MN

1306
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
Like legitimately

1307
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,335
I wanted to do an entire episode

1308
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
About

1309
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
There was a you can find this on YouTube

1310
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
If you want

1311
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,503
An episode of Opie

1312
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,807
Where Patrice O'Neal goes on

1313
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,111
I tried to tell them about The Obama Deception

1314
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
It's an hour long

1315
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,695
I'm talking about how great this movie

1316
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,023
I wanted to do an episode of our show where we're like

1317
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
This is

1318
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
The effect

1319
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,607
Have a documentary like this

1320
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,167
You have is a respected comic

1321
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,191
And someone who people think

1322
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
Is a really brilliant guy

1323
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Like Patrice O'Neal

1324
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:48,895
Sure it's coming on to Opie and Anthony

1325
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:52,991
Necessarily in that right-wing Patriot world right and you have

1326
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,295
Someone falling for the ideas

1327
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,343
Better put forth in the documentary

1328
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
At one point in the interview

1329
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,023
F****** Patrice starts talkin about

1330
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,583
Nathan Rothschild and it sting at Waterloo

1331
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,519
Nazi propaganda that he's heard from the likes of Alex Jones maybe he watched game

1332
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
So he's just

1333
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
On exam

1334
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
And so no

1335
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
Is very powerful

1336
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
The LIE

1337
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Is

1338
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Maximilian

1339
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
The truth

1340
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,831
Is what we are doing

1341
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:35,487
And it's not working all that great

1342
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,583
Because if we're not the

1343
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,703
I mean it's still relatively the same ratio as the LIE

1344
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,519
Click Count versus the retraction

1345
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,431
You know whenever whenever Fox News or somebody puts up something that clearly bulshit

1346
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:58,783
Everybody called him out on it and they write the retraction Alex apologize

1347
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Hamdi ulukaya

1348
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,159
What is 1 + 1 is

1349
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,279
Going down a road

1350
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Is very easy

1351
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
Explain why

1352
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
This is stupid

1353
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
The draft

1354
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
But it's still so much better

1355
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
The last two

1356
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,519
Absolutely

1357
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Realtor

1358
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,311
Coming to his shop again

1359
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,455
News

1360
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,063
What is that

1361
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,391
This episode was

1362
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
Kind of

1363
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
That maybe

1364
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
It would have been

1365
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
Is because this narrative

1366
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
The show does end up being Alex

1367
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,143
Just fake crying and yelling about

1368
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
The draft

1369
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
No

1370
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
No

1371
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
That's not that's not

1372
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
You had a week off

1373
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:59,455
I think I rushed through some stuff and nobody some notes

1374
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:04,319
Metal note back better than ever next

1375
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Sounds like a plan

1376
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
It's knowledge freight.com

1377
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
Update.com

1378
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,191
You still did also legally change my name to

1379
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,871
Realtor

1380
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:33,503
Facebook is where my favorite things to do

1381
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
It's so great

1382
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
A lot of fun

1383
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,855
Russell

1384
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,903
Describe your friend

1385
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Mitch

1386
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Mitch on the show

1387
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
I know that we say no snitching

1388
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
The doctors

1389
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Snitch all you want

1390
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Tell people

1391
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,663
I think the way he presents himself definite like he's

1392
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
His

1393
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Sort of autobiography

1394
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Exxon him

1395
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,879
Paul Joseph Watson

1396
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:18,303
And this is a rare appearance of him verbally being on the show we got to celebrate

1397
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,143
Even though he hasn't been a bunch of drugs when he was younger

1398
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,239
Alright

1399
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
His employer

1400
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Alex Jones

1401
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Oh yeah

1402
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Technically

1403
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Probably guilty

1404
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:40,319
Alex
