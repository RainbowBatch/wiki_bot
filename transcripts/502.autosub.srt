1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
Sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Emmerich June

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordan

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
What's up

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,776
Now it is my turn to say that my bright spot is Assassin's Creed Valhalla

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,152
The game and I'm very dizzy

12
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,992
Excited first of all to be out of the snow now I've gotten to the point where I'm not

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
Does rediger free for free

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
But also that like they brought back

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
The homestead

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Aspects of

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
I love so much

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,584
Love the idea of just building up a little settlement and all that

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Some of those really missing

20
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
From the last two games

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
I do enjoy that quite a bit

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Obviously not played nearly as much as you but I've been quite a bit

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Of the things that they

24
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
I think they fixed a lot of things

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
That we're kind of little

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Hurdles

27
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,624
Play in the past ones

28
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
It's very very good

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
I look forward

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
Do a dabbling around

31
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Playing

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
For the next very long time

33
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Problem

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,264
There's because I finish the audiobook invented came out I'm like

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
Out of of all other work

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Like this is my reward

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
So I'm just putting

38
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Hours upon hours

39
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Intuit

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Island

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
I swear to you I

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
Don't think I've gotten out of the

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:35,136
I still think the title card is coming like

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Good.

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
What the genre in the style of

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
You came there for

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,728
Totally my bright spot Dan is it is one

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Leslie Jones

49
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
On the reboot of Supermarket Sweep

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
It is

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Fant

52
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
It is first I'm hearing about this

53
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
This to know it's so great like the old guy was fantastic turnout he was just he was just that white guy who

54
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Was 5 ft

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
3

56
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
And Leslie Jones

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Host of the show a

58
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Exactly how I would host the

59
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
The show and watches the sweep exactly how I watch it

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Incredibly serious

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
Oh okay

62
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Yeah Bandits

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Perfect that is great

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
To go with it one is like that the better option totally

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Incredibly serious just

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Straight face

67
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
You've got the cup of coffee that's $300 already you're going to go back again to take the I think you could get I could do that

68
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
That really well

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
It would be much more.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
Difficult to pull off in an entertaining funny way

71
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
Supermarket Sweep when I would stay home sick

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Every part of the show is

73
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
Is better than what you remember and Leslie is

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Credibly good

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,808

00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
And if I hadn't had to pour over as much

80
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
Stuff is I have to get this episode ready

81
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
I was going

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
What does a prize You by putting on a truck

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
A cab

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
Pics of the open with Eastbound & Down

85
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,831

87
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Stay were truck

88

C.w. McCall

89
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Pittsburgh real

90
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
3 year old

91
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
I didn't realize we had hip

92
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Webster truckers now to

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
So we have

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Quite a bit of

95
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Nonsense to go over over the

96
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
November 9th

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
211

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
And yeah this is

99
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
I'm excited

100
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
And I

101
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,695
Decided that this series is going to have a name because Monday is the conclusion of it

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Because we don't know what happened

103
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Alex hasn't gotten down to DC not there yet for me to cover everything

104
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Broken it up into

105
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
The two chunks

106
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
And we're calling this

107
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
Cara vanity project

108
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
I'm going to have

109
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
To take words away from you

110
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
If you want to use them you can ask

111
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Wealthy I was thinking about it I was like a written request

112
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
I was sitting there like this is kind of a vanity project

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,607
Dick from a Caravan Grand Caravan project kisses amazing Jordan's going to hate it

114
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Even worse because I know how long it took you

115
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
Second thought after coming up with a detector

116
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
Furious

117
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,551

Sailor Moon Spirit sister Stephanie

00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Is it going to rain

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Agoda website

142
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
What you can do is

143
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Get yourself a big old cart

144
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Run it up and down the metaphorical

145
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Grocery aisle

146
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Do not forget the turkey those are $100 balls

147
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,887
Make sure that you get what's on the shopping list this week that the next

148
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Tu250.

149
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
Are you going to want to get the triple bonus that's $300

150
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Down to your local charity or Belvoir

151
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
And donate

152
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
Not bad not bad

153
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
The same bonuses as the old one or did they

154
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
A flip-up what I do

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
You need to get

156
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Coffee

157
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
Jerky Leroy

158
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,751
Thermoses and chitlins

159
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Just myself

160
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
Wonderful I'm about to get on this immediately

161
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Episode

162
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
Caravan

163
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,575
So Jordan our Wednesday episode we learned the new Infowars plan to run a caravan from

164
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Austin Texas

165
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Then upward along the east coast arriving on Friday and washing

166
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Then d.c.

167
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
The idea

168
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
I guess is that

169
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
The Cavalry is coming

170
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
The drop these fight off the globalist Menace

171
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,935
Prudential Reality is a little less noble than

172
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
On an Optics level

173
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
The goal is very obviously meant to provide Trump Within

174
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,639
An appearance that he could use to make claims that the people are demanding that he fight back against the Alexa

175
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
The result

176
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Because he lost

177
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
This Caravan is an attempt of the people's

178
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
Start to turn themselves into human prop

179
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Which Trump can use to justify an authoritarian power grab

180
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,695
On a deeper level this is Alex attempting to pull off an outstanding

181
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
Overly ambitious and protect protracted publicity

182
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Please.

183
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,655
He's hoping that sending dum dum Owen Shroyer at the Barn store in the Eastern side of the country

184
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Will force the media to pay attention to

185
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
And his mind Owens going to

186
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
Pick up a couple hundred Patriots in Austin and by the time he reaches Houston the number will be in the

187
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Thousand

188
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
By the time they hit d.c.

189
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
It'll be a massive people it'll be impossible to ignore

190
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
This is not what's going to happen

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm so feeling that

192
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
He's hoping the people with big social media reaches

193
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
We unable to resist meme in the f*** out of clips

194
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
On the road

195
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
And he'll be able to drive some trap

196
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
The final thing that this done accomplishes

197
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Is it provide something with a

198
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Drastic immediacy

199
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,007
They can distract the audience for realizing that if anything Alex says means anything

200
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
No number of people showing up in DC is going to mean

201
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
A damn thing

202
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,479
Because I was already said that the globalists are going to kill everyone no matter what and they even if Trump is

203
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Successful there's a plan B

204
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
That the Patriots

205
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Can't Stop

206
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
In this sense the Caravan serves as the shity

207
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Shiny set of keys that Alec

208
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Mexican jingle around to keep people

209
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Cancel an auto-ship

210
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
Biting his one we need to kill everyone and overthrow the United States government

211
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Biden

212
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
We're going to go on a road trip they got 79 days of hell

213
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
I bought a URL literal devil has one

214
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Let's get on the road

215
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
We're already just bullshiting about the

216
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,695
The apocalypse on the devil why not create our own tribulation it's fantastic

217
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
All that being said I love this

218
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
It's my favorite thing to divorce is done in a long time

219
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Partially because it's

220
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
No naked and tramps

221
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Parenteral

222
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,263
If this ends up being anything notable Italy a collection of people whose various scams are endangered

223
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
If Trump is out of office

224
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,919
He could easily end up being like the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous but you replace the Nazis and white power groups

225
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
With pill salesman

226
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,503
And YouTube commentators who just now realized

227
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Overplayed their hand

228
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Canarian way too deep

229
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
On another level this also scratches a very pretty

230
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Particular itch for me

231
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
And that's what I f****** love Road

232
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
I love road trip so much that I

233
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Kind of fond memories of Tom Green's movie wrote

234
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,287
Back when I was younger me and my friends would often just embarked on random trips for the sake of driving a couple hours or a day

235
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Hey way to see what was there

236
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,943
Sometimes there was a destination but other times it was just the experience of being out on the road

237
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
Seeing things that weren't part of our normal routine which was the

238
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Actual reward itself

239
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
I love that

240
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
And it's one of the

241
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Things that I feel is most missing

242
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
For my adult life

243
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
You're probably a big part of why I dream of getting an RV in wandering the country

244
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Caravan

245
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
He's been branded these stop the steel Caravan and I cannot

246
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Not pay

247
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
All the attention in the world

248
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
What's a better name and stop this

249
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Steel

250
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,335
Harold trying to piggyback this stop this

251
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
Steel momentum that people like Ali Alexander have been pushing for a little while

252
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
Choosing that name as well go all the way back

253
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
We got to go all the way back

254
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
226 to UB election and you think

255
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Hangouts

256
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
All the way there's a connection there but I'm not sure what it is

257
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
And I

258
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Because it's

259
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
It's frustrating

260
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
An article from the Southern Poverty Law Center Trace be

261
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
The current pushers of the term stop this

262
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,407
Bastille number of new far-right folks

263
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Who are connected to Rodger

264
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
People like Jack

265
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
So big Mike cernovich and Ali

266
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
They're amplification of it reached other Fringe figures like

267
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
Michelle Malkin

268
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Faith Goldy

269
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
And then even

270
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Trump son Eric

271
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Who pushed the term onto a larger audience

272
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
It's hard not to feel like all of this somehow

273
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Back to Stone but

274
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Improve it

275
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
It drives me nuts

276
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
It's important to recognize before we get too far into any of this there two threads

277
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
To keep the stick

278
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Both of them which are branded stop

279
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Bastille

280
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
The first of the series of depressing protests are being organized around the

281
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Some of them may be organically started and organized

282
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
And some of maybe AstroTurf by tea party groups and write

283
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
When money they wants the result of

284
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
The protest but definitely doesn't want to be associated with

285
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
That's really a smaller issue to me what's

286
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Organic and what

287
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
It's not investigate or probably publish

288
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
He's about in about a year

289
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
What's definitely true about the

290
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
These protests is it they're being Amplified and pushed by this network

291
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Desperate Trump scam

292
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,871
The second thread is Alex's Caravan

293
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Would you spiritually connected

294
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Bellevue protest

295
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Results

296
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Trying to selfishly profit off them as well

297
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,343
How it's supposed to be stuck is not about bringing more attention to these protests

298
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Take whatever energy

299
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
My generator

300
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
And steal it

301
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Increase the spotlight

302
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
On his tank with a huge Infowars logo on it

303
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Almost like

304
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
This is a

305
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
A conference of scammers

306
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
And Alex

307
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
It is it is lonely

308
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
It's totally like baby

309
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
Maybe you have to scam them to get into the scam conference you know it's like an entry

310
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Alex tuch on man Island

311
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Exactly

312
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Zambo as it relates to protest

313
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
For most of his career he just uses them to self aggrandize himself

314
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Make the protest about

315
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
This is no.

316
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Course

317
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
That's why I'm treating Alex's Caravan stunt as a separate thing from the protest even though they're technically both

318
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Part of the same desperation strategy

319
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
It's being used by these Doom

320
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
It simultaneously more simple and more complicated than the sad protest

321
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
I will save it as I'm preparing this episode it does not look good like we're like the Caravan is really set the world

322
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
World on fire

323
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,087
If you judge by the number of views that the videos on banned. Video have

324
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
The kick-off video and Austin has about 130 set

325
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
7000 views but

326
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
But the drop-off

327
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
From there is quite

328
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Noticed

329
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Yes

330
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
It doesn't feel like this is working out so

331
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
So far and that being said

332
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
I still

333
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,447
I would give anything to have been able to go along for the ride

334
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,567
I feel like I could have written my own fear and loathing long after the campaign Trail 2020

335
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
If I would have been allowed to go

336
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
It sadly that will never be

337
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
For now the best I can do is

338
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
This two-part series on art

339
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
About the Tor Owen Shroyer is taking

340
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
From Austin UPS

341
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
To d.c.

342
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
On the information available to me from

343
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
How far

344
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
Since the timing is what it is this going to be part one where and we'll discuss what happened on the Caravan tour

345
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
Between its launch on November 9th

346
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
And then

347
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,655
To the end of Alex's show on Wednesday November

348
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
After that we'll pick up on Mondays episode

349
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
So we'll wrap things up

350
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
With the Wednesday Thursday

351
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
And then the event in d.c.

352
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
There stood

353
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Is very very stupid

354
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
I fucken love

355
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
I love it

356
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
So much

357
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
I can't

358
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
I can't believe

359
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
The main reason that you do a caravan is

360
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
I believe wholeheartedly

361
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
You're going to pick up

362
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Momentum along

363
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
The way

364
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,303
You know it's going to start as a small thing and then it's going to snow

365
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
And you know

366
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,423
The premise for you even to get the moment they said Caravan

367
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
I knew it was going to fizzle out

368
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
In the way that are

369
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Firework

370
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Should feel like an inverse firework

371
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
You know it's going to

372
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Explode

373
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Physically

374

Yeah I don't know I'm don't get ahead of yourself with predictions alcohol but

375
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
I mean we'll see we'll see what all this

376
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
What goes down alright

377
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Today Show

378
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
I am a president I am the President

379
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
I am 46

380
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,095
Alex has declared himself president

381
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
Elaboration

382
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Bowling night

383
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,383
I'm not positive if David Knight had any Caravan business

384
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
On November 9th

385
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,991
And hopefully never know because I didn't listen to what I'm not going

386
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
November 9th

387
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
On Alex

388
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Show

389
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
And

390
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
He's tried to keep Spirits High

391
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
There is still

392
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
To win the election

393
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Fairly and squarely

394
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
That was sitting in

395
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
What are the offices this morning

396
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
12 ft away from a trash can

397
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
I should watch this and I threw a little

398
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Turn off the wall

399
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
File cabinet and into the trash

400
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
Getaround

401
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,631
Around is the law

402
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
We're going to build a wall

403
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Alright

404
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
And I will

405
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
If everyone bullhorn to the White House

406
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Call the White House

407
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
The bullhorn the White House

408
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
The bullhorn marlago comes back and forth

409
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Pointy ears

410
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
Him know what's happening with the unfolding and I can tell you

411
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,679
On the phone with

412
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Salisbury close to president or the president if I need to

413
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
I don't have a day or two.

414
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Telephone

415
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
Many times they call that missed the call

416
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
I miss some of the calls are in the last few days I cannot

417
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
By the telephone

418
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
I cannot sit

419
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
By the telephone

420
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
It makes me sick

421
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Bomb here phone

422
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
I missed the phone call

423
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
Calls

424
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
But when I map

425
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:25,311
You know what happens every time I go to call him and he's in the middle of calling me and then the line is busy

426
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Yeah man

427
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,407
I don't think this is a good angle beak

428
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,991
Because Alex is already said multiple times that he and Trump are literally Psych

429
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Seafood Connection

430
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,671
I really don't think they understand that his advice is essentially

431
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,255
Bully your fearless leader into taking over as a dick

432
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,863
I mean that's really what it seems like

433
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
The whole thing is

434
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Be a bully

435
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
To a guy that we think is unbelievable

436
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
Even though we obviously know if we just

437
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,943
Which Adam apparently he'll do whatever we want

438
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Caravan as a whole is like

439
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
That is

440
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Directed at

441
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Trump

442
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,415
Exactly it's not really for us

443
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Support

444
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
It's the yell at Rebellion

445
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,911
To give him already

446
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
Kind of the idea

447
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,919
You've always been conception and execution it's very bad

448
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,295
I love that Alex is saying like I take this nap and then I miss Trump calling it recently we've seen that Alex

449
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Did you get the prophetic visions

450
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
The other get the call in the nap

451
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
He might have that would explain everything

452
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Everyone else in the world is

453
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Too dumb

454
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
To see what Alex

455
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Everything is so clear to him

456
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
And you

457
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
F****** idiot

458
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Just won't get

459
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Get it together

460
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
It's all America will probably

461
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
That sounds right

462
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Thursday while he's president-elect

463
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Running is fake task force

464
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Truck cannot assault

465
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
Fraud of the scam and lay it all out

466
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
House addresses and it's over

467
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Enchilada of the in

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
It's like

469
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
Soviet Union

470
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Instead of

471
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
That's fine

472
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Sounds like a great Patriot

473
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
Lotto America no matter what

474
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,992

475
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552

480
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Republic

481
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Is based on the blood

482
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Patriot

483
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,728
And I'll stand up for it as long as I'm making a dollar off.

484
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
You guys can all burn to hell

485
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,872
So Alex has this strange thing going on about like how he can't get ahold of

00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Trump in like

487
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Text today

488
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
Because

489
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
I'm officially choking on air

490
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
I love my crew

491
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
All stressed out

492
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
And

493
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Over the edge

494
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Professional I am some of the Caribbean

495
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Knox

496
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,320
Bag and then get ahold of Don Jr and then get the present on the phone

497
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
And that hope he listens to me about this stuff

498
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
And there's nothing more frustrating

499
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
Been missing phone calls from the president

500
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Wow

501
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Seems like

502
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Describing isn't anybody

503
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,592
Have to beg somebody to get a hold of John Jr does seem like that

504
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
That's the only way to get

505
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Get there

506
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
That's not gray.

507
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,248
Jr's handlers are doing a lot

508
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
To keep Alex Jones

509
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,720
Don Jr will believe any old b******* Alex please don't get him anywhere near there

515
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Corsi is

And what they do is basically what we were already talking about about this

524
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
This whole idea of going to Washington

525
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
It's a threat

526
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
To Trump

527
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
They're saying basically

528
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
We will

529
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864

545
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
We were overdoing

546
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,304
Arguing with everybody who's accurately describing your actions

547
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Yeah yeah

548
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
Why in God's name

549
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Would you think

550
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
He's going to step up

551
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Be the leader now

552
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
Did you really convinced yourself that all you need to do to step up and be a leader is be a belligerent a****** on TV

553
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
That

554
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
I think they know what they think

555
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:00,064
Yeah I think that is what Alex thinks he's done very little ass

556
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Alex has a little bit of an inch

557
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Slated sin

00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696

I love you

623
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056
So I mean like Alex is the one who keeps actor

624
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,920
Sing like he's going out of business saying we can't afford to stay in business

625
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,784
People get that idea

626
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,976
That was two years ago so who knows alot and then

627
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
Terms of employees like going and working somewhere else I would to constantly set on are these not the

628
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
Fire people it again

629
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,264
If I heard her I wouldn't risk it

630
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,128
I wouldn't hurt it one time even if I knew on-air he's a lying piece of s*** I be like

631
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Just it's still in there

632
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
He's not full of s*** this time

633
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Leaving you like

634
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
Without a job out of nowhere

635
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
I'll go find someplace

636
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Buckling back

637
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,792
But I bet he has a better like workouts

638
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Have to assume

639
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
Yelled at every time because I'm

640
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
14 and I don't know how to pull up a

641
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Clip goddamn 14

642
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
So Alex believes

643
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
Releases pretending to believe

644
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
That he is actually respond

645
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Possible for Trump knocking

646
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,224
And he wants to see if the American people really ready to fight

647
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
Fight for this country and have it back to I think there's an element of that

648
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Cuz if he sees

649
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Millions in d.c.

650
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
As soon as I saw us

651
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,512
As soon as I saw everybody around

652
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
They specifically mentioned

653
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,240
Getting together in Austin and I like

654
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Conceited

655
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
That's all people

656
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Get together in Austin haha

657
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Yeah alright

658
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,760
Trump has lied guy if eyes are come up to his

659
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Mr. president

660
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Protectionism play

661
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Is been Unleashed

662
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
So they talked a little bit about what people are afraid of

663
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Then I kind of agree

664
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Fraud

665
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
What's a jail with nobody have Jose a try, agent

666
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Illegitimate

667
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Calling us out to action

668
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,128
I don't agree with anything that he said except for yes I think he's very much afraid

669
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
People like you

670
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
Crazy friend

671
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
Because that would

672
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Very much cos

673
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
People to die

674
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
On TV I'm calling on

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Patriots to

676
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,352
Take over this country action

677
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,424
Yeah we're going to die like a green light

678
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Totally

679
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Straight up Non-Stop

680
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Mass murder

681
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,616
Anyway Alex gives you a reason to think he's going out of business which

682
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
I don't know why you was confused about it earlier

683
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Play responsibilities

684
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
Shorty need but it takes money to do it

685
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
I'm watching what I did two months ago.

686
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
The capital

687
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,768
Last time we didn't have enough Capital to keep going

688
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Wow

689
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,376
That's that's why that's almost like he's like why would you leave

690
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
I've been in this situation so many times I'll figure out a way to pay you eventually come on it did strike

691
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Makes me as like

692
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,432
I'm guilty of this to like being like that maybe this is the time that he's actually

693
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
Completely f***** on the money order

694
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Totally

695
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
I'm so

696
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
Assertive

697
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
The distance desensitized to it now that like

698
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
The time that he is

699
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Actually Fox

700
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,792
Yeah I probably will just make a guy got sure yard

701
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:39,168
We get to the actual bit of information here and this is about

702
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
The vaccine

703
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Advisor short has a released information about

704
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
I bet it's true

705
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
Boy Alex isn't it about

706
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Covid-19

707
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Klepto

708
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,024
Governor Cuomo cannot said I don't care what he says it's not safe

709
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Because I want the lockdown to continue

710
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm not endorsing the vaccine

711
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Real

712
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Attenuated version of the virus. An mRNA vaccine

713
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Control the fear

714
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Data solution

715
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,856
This vaccine was created by Pfizer was not done because Trump wanted to undercut Bill Gates and all that s***

716
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,464
That's silly and Gates Foundation is given vaccine-related grants to Pfizer in Spanish

717
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Whatever good working

718
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Also when the news about the vaccine broke

719
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Whine like a baby

720
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,936
Can claim that the vaccine was withheld so he wouldn't have a wind during his term

721
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,008
They waited until after the election to bring out this news

722
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Yeah I'm kind of f******

723
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Stupid cuz he

724
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Still president

725
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,360
Until January

726
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Nonsense

727
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Pfizer released

728
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
Scathing statement about how they don't care about politics in their bark

729
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,552
Concerned with the global emergency

730
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,928
Don't think of the release of his vaccines made to him and make him look bad so I think maybe he and Alex have different talking

731
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Pinpoints on this one

732
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,024
Further Alex has no idea what he's talking

733
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,888
The vaccine being announced by Pfizer is an mRNA vaccine

734
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
Who's playing against the alternative the Gaithers

735
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,776
Is evil mRNA vaccine is the exact

736
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Same type of virus vaccine

737
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,152
He's literally no grass for the subject he's covering and you just makes

738
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
This s*** up as it goes along

739
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,760
It's embarrassing I'm just more interested in what does he want

740
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,600
What do you mean what you're off to see the

741
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
Trump created this vaccine in order to

742
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Control fear and they

743
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
They don't want to give you the vaccine because they want the lockdown to continue now I don't want to give you the vaccine because I think vaccines are Eve

744
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
But they are doing this to me

745
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
What are you

746
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,240
Positively what would you prefer happen

747
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
No unvax

748
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
See you never

749
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
And then what

750
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,408
Crush doctors

751
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Kill scientist

752
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,320
Okay well that actually does sound right

753
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,648
I forgot I should have started from the assumption that it's always

754
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,744
Chris Cuomo doesn't want people taking

755
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
This vaccine

756
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
I guess

757
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Flip a coin

758
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Beer to keep going

759
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
You get their mRNA vaccine

760
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
Big shot by a BB gun

761
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Versus big shot by

762
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
12-gauge shotgun

763
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
I'm not saying take

764
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Vaccine

765
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
I'm not saying

766
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Check the regular

767
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Pfizer

768
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
Attenuated

769
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Coronavirus

770
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
See this is where it would help Alex

771
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
To know what he's talking about

772
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:57,056
He's saying the Governor Cuomo doesn't want people to take the Pfizer vaccine because what he really wants is for everyone

773
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,152
It is much more dangerous and deadly mRNA vaccine it'll come out later

774
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Thanks Bill Gates

775
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
The normal attenuated vaccine is bad but

776
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,832
Equipment wants to hurt people more so you insist they wait until an mRNA one is ready

777
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Great play

778
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648
That's a fun story to tell dumb dumb

779
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
But it really does

780
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,768
Doesn't make sense when you realize at the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine

781
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
If you know that then Alex

782
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,192
Cuz you're saying the Cuomo doesn't want you to take an mRNA vaccine because he wants you to wait until there's an mRNA vaccine ready

783
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Nonsense

784
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
Alex needs to try harder

785
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
Because this is just embarrassing Lee sloppy

786
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,384
There's not even a conspiracy to unravel lyrics

787
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,968
An instance where he clearly is making up details about this Pfizer vaccine

788
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Beauty knows nothing about it

789
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
And it would severely hurt his ability to support Trump

790
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
If you had to explain why Trump was trying to take credit for an mRNA vaccine something that he specifically and repeatedly is

791
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
Said he's going to kill everyone

792
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,120
This is the time for him to stand up and really be the leader

793
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Right now yeah

794
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
Also let's remember that this vaccine that's being touted by Pfizer they're saying that has 90%

795
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Set success rate

796
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,432
But that's not been validated by peer reviewed study scream from the rooftops

797
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
Does the answer to the prayer

798
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Promising

799
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
And I do hope that things

800
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Continue to look good

801
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,184
It's kind of a sticky situation and someone like Cuomo is in an unfortunate position to have to be

802
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
Now you know the person who

803
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Have some picture

804
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
To say about this

805
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Special vaccine

806
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Yeah

807
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
Not even available and he's already being

808
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
Called out for like not wanting to give it to people yet

809
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
You know

810
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,848
This is really just the way that people flip a narrative when they know that they can't really argue the vax

811
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Scene anymore

812
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:41,760
Their game of being staunchly opposed to any and all that scene is great when there isn't an actual vaccine Canada

813
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,136
Once there is they know that opposing the release and distribution of That vaccine is tantamount to them saying

814
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
That they are supported

815
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Continuing deaths of thousands

816
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
From covid-19 it's really hard

817
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
How to defend that one in

818
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
And most of them particular

819
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,704
Lee the ones Work Media

820
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
To publicly argue that position

821
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,288
And it will hurt their bottom line

822
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
So you see what someone like Alex does

823
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,408
He lies about how this vaccine from Pfizer

824
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Is one of the less Dangerous Ones

825
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
And pretend that there's a

826
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Conspiracy against Trump

827
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Among anyone

828
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,136
Who would say like 8 maybe it's premature to widely released as one

829
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Still need some more tests.

830
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
It's all garbled

831
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
The point isn't the

832
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
Yeah yeah

833
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
You if you think that there's something about this

834
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
That's like the vaccine

835
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
Is actually relevant to the argument that

836
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
That's why you gay

837
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Can pigs Act

838
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
That's the issue

839
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
It's just

840
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
A bunch of s***

841
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
Spinning around in the f****** toilet

842
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Spirals down into our collect

843
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Active sadness

844
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:52,160
Yeah that's a poetic word

845
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
We're done with a knife

846
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
So can you show is not good

847
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
It's it's

848
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
It is what it is

849
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,144
Is not nearly enough Caravan for me the only thing I'm

850
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
Interested in

851
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
We get into now the videos that Owen has released

852
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Okay for the Caravan

853
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
I'm sorry on the 9th

854
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Anna Anna Anna

855
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Owen sits down

856
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Any breaks down with the

857
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
The trip is going to look like

858
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
Here is the itinerary can't wait

859
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
This is a map

860
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
And on this map

861
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
I got to see

862
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Little Road

863
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Okay so

864
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
We are launching

865
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Stop the

866
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Caravan

867
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
And it is going to be launching

868
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
At 5 p.m.

869
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
And what we're going to do is

870
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Going to drive right down here

871
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
And a huge

872
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
We're going to have our first stop tonight

873
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
8 p.m.

874
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Then we got a long drive ahead of us

875
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
To go all the way here

876
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Through Louisiana we make

877
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Make It Stop maybe in

878
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Theater something

879
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Parsippany

880
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
All the way through here down to Florida and

881
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Tallahassee

882
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
This is where we will be

883
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Tuesday

884
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
First of all this is a severe schedule

885
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,776
Alex up there going to go slow you heard that isn't as brutal

886
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,592
Austin to Tallahassee and basically a day's time

887
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,688
If they're leaving Austin at 5 p.m. they should have no problem getting to Houston by

888
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,784
It's about a two-and-a-half-hour drive so I guess that shouldn't be an issue

889
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
The next leg of the trip is a

890
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Concern

891
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,696
Owen seems to be a little loose on the details but according to his itinerary would say post

892
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Online

893
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,816
They're set to be in Baton Rouge Louisiana by 11 a.m. on Tuesday

894
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
It's good they didn't choose New Orlean

895
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
Extra hours add-on

896
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
How to drive

897
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Still this is

898
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
24-hour Drive

899
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,568
Assuming that they get to Houston on time then they ever rally

900
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,616
Are they going to stay the night in Houston

901
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
We could probably pull that off

902
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
2 hour rally

903
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Then go to bed

904
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
Get up and get on the road by 7

905
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
Then they could make it to Baton Rouge by 11

906
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,464
Then they got to have a Louisiana rally and then get to Tallahassee by

907
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
BPM for another rally

908
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
That's an approximately 7 hour drive

909
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,936
Forgiveness of 2 hours in Baton Rouge for the rally and everything that they're doing

910
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
It could work out

911
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
That's f****** tight battle

912
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,848
It's almost like they're expecting everything to either be nothing

913
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
Or that everyone will plan things

914
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
For them

915
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
Ready

916
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
To go ahead of time when they get there

917
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,296
It's it's sloppy from a production

918
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
Anything goes wrong

919
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Anything anything goes wrong

920
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
They're inside

921
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
Higher trip is behind

922
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
Hounded

923
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
What does it matter

924
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
No course they get to Tallahassee at 9

925
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,008
If the stakes are low but also the setup is terrible

926
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
The next day's a little bit better paste

927
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,199
On Wednesday but this is a very very poorly time brute has not suggest that they had a lot of time

928
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Compliant

929
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Here's what happens on Wednesday

930
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
Then on Wednesday

931
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
We're going to head north

932
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Do here

933
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Wake up in

934
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Atlanta

935
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
Friends

936
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
That'll be

937
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Wednesday

938
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
I'm in Thursday

939
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
We're going to head out to

940
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
North Carolina

941
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,607
Charlotte

942
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
Heading to

943
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Virginia

944
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
This is a little better spaced-out

945
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,311
The first stop of the day there on Wednesday is 3 p.m. in Atlanta which is only 4 hours

946
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Tallahassee

947
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
To be totally fine

948
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
The next stop of the rally is in

949
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
Columbia South Carolina at 8

950
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
Yeah that's another 3 hours on the road so as long as they limit their

951
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
Thursday in Atlanta 22 hours this should be possible

952
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
That seems like what they did they gave themselves

953
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
2 hours a day

954
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
Then on Thursday they do not go to Charlotte

955
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
In fact they don't go to Charlotte at all

956
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:47,935
The next step is Raleigh and then there's another three-and-a-half-hour upside that he's another three and a half hours in the car

957
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
At 3 p.m. so they should be able

958
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Go to make that 15

959
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,871
After that it's on to Richmond Virginia for an 8 p.m. rally which again should be no problem

960
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
I'm in the next phase in DC so they can get there whenever they f****** want

961
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,527
Really this is a horribly designed trip

962
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
First day out

963
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Must have been brutal

964
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
Yeah like I've been on the road

965
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
When I look at it that like

966
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
Wuuno yeah yeah

967
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,375
No I've been in 7 hours in like you're adding on time to get meals

968
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Listen to go to the bathroom and unexpected

969
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
Did things just always happen

970
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Yep

971
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,567
So it just seems like I would not want I want to go along with

972
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,615
But I wouldn't want to be the ones doing it out

973
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
I wouldn't want to be like

974
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Responsible

975
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,271
No and it was clearly planned in a in about 45 minutes

976
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,575
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't

977
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Account for

978
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
Time zones and all of this

979
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
Oh I didn't

980
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,327
What I was planning at like how many hours apart they are about that

981
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
I think we might find out if they did too

982
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
So

983
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Alex

984
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:59,103
His giving his his little like YouTube

985
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Quite abruptly

986
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,711
Do not more coming there infowars.com I want Royale lead the attack

987
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,695
Very important people.

988

11 punch

989
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,655
We get to turn the other cheek right into their f******

990
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Faceit

991
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
We get to 5 p.m. Owen Shroyer goes down to the

992
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
State capitol Court

993
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
He's got to pay

994
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Patriots there

995
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
InStyle

996
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175

We got a lot of

1004
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Peace out here that

1005
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Tonight

1006
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,887
I want is a great group of Patriots they are sending him off in Austin

1007
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
Can clearly hear the excitement

1008
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:03,103
Rousing cheer in the background how many people are there for Owen send-off and I will give you a

1009
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Okay I do have it

1010
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:10,527
An exact number

1011
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
I think we are

1012
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
I'm going to go with 13 peep

1013
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:18,719
9 people in their hometown

1014
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:25,119
If you send off a vent for their cross-country barnstorming

1015
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
And you're being sent off by all the

1016
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Look drunk people in the bleary-eyed morning absolutely picture you can imagine it

1017
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Admire Owen

1018
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Attempt

1019
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,663
To keep a stiff upper lip to pretend that this is a great turnout

1020
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:44,063
He's doing great I'm pretty sure that's everyone who is there too because when the livestream starts there's actually only six people behind

1021
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Going

1022
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,951
I'm at the Corral the other three to get into the shop to make it look like there's more people there

1023
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,791
Old people out of a Denny's

1024
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,887
Sadman but it's amazing it's my favorite genre of entertainment

1025
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
This is like this I could watch

1026
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
B forever

1027
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
Do it try to stay Brave

1028
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
Completely obvious sadness

1029
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Just it's just

1030
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,687
It couldn't be more Blackadder

1031
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
Like it is just

1032
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Cure

1033
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
Your

1034
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
Stupid it's amazing

1035
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,135
So here's here's a little bit of Owen talking about where they're about to head off to

1036
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
Hermann Park

1037
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Miller Hill

1038
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
We want to try to be there by 8

1039
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
We may be running a

1040
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
But we should be there by 9

1041
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,679
Name of the latest it's your first leg of the Yard-Man

1042
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
And especially with that

1043
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,823
Free simple language in Austin

1044
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
I mean if you're worried if you're worried about that

1045
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,271
That's a good Park in Houston

1046
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Who donated a bunch of land to the city

1047
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Abbott also fought for the king

1048
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,951
Confederacy

1049
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Yeah you think

1050
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
So are we get

1051
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,559
201 talking about

1052
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,655
Unit B this seems like a comedy show guy I like a promoter

1053
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:09,055
Maybe a local show guy who booked

1054
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
Tomorrow we're going to

1055
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Going through hopefully we'll have a stop

1056
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
Open Baton Rouge

1057
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
In Tallahassee

1058
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
The Florida

1059
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Tomorrow night

1060
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Turn out there

1061
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,343
Should be a big turnout in Tallahassee

1062
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
I know there's people there

1063
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,279
You should have been here an hour before you thousands

1064
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Last week was Pac-Man

1065
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Sorry I don't know what happened

1066
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
Sewing doesn't really have much to say

1067
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,007
People

1068
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
The first fella

1069
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,615
So we got a lot of people out here

1070
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
You people why it's so important

1071
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Come here

1072
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
Okay give me a Richard

1073
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Richard Reeves Infowars

1074
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Gold friend of Alex's this is not

1075
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,303
Someone high-profile maybe an employee profile

1076
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
They have a big media presence

1077
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
What's 2

1078
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
I'm surprised Joe isn't

1079
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
Are you know Rogan should be right there exactly

1080
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Globalist

1081
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,687
Well you know

1082
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,479
Rogan's out there that would

1083
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
Definitely giving them quite a spotlight

1084
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
They do have a lot of media there though

1085
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Multiple news

1086
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Media

1087
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
Out here course the local

1088
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Front door

1089
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
As long as

1090
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
You make it pork

1091
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
As long as you realize

1092
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
The final level

1093
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,591
Well I don't I don't know if there's multiple media Outlets

1094
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
Depends on what you can

1095
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
Consider a media Outlet

1096
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,247
14 people exist in space

1097
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,063
There might be a blogger there

1098
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,623
Richard Reid might have a website

1099
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,183
You could say Infowars is there

1100
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,743
Innocence the internet is National

1101
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,631
The interviews are what they are. They're pretty boring

1102
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,655
Going to leave

1103
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
But youth interrupted

1104
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
We got to get to Houston

1105
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
We're going to take off

1106
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
We still alive

1107
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
What's up

1108
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
What is it called when a radical

1109
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Feminist

1110
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Star God

1111
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Facial hair

1112
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
After protests

1113
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
President

1114
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
Impeachment

1115
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
Hahaha

1116
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,023
Didn't even get good laughs there from that crowd

1117
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
So this is a guy who got interviewed by Owen earlier who

1118
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,591
A response from the gathered

1119
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,687
Is it kills just kills my clan meetings was it was everybody loving this

1120
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
So

1121
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
What's good

1122
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Ruby driving

1123
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Lodging

1124
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
You just stay the course with us

1125
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
On Friday

1126
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Saturday's a big

1127
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Big Daddy

1128
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Trump

1129
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
DC

1130
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
To stop

1131
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
This deal so

1132
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Are you guys ready

1133
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
How to make history

1134
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
Are we ready to make history and save this country

1135
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,359
God bless the Patriots.

1136
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Cookout

1137
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
Possible

1138
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
Hit the road will see you at

1139
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Still Caravan

1140
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
F****** William Wallace chick right there man

1141
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Wow

1142
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
We declare

1143
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,839
Our independence day

1144
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,847
The Optics of this are very very depressing. Good

1145
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,151
Stop

1146
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
You would expect

1147
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,223
Is going

1148
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Awesome

1149
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,295
Zagg.com

1150
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:09,695
Absolutely you might be surprised to find out on the way from Austin to Houston

1151
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
Call into Infowars

1152
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
I had to come on here and do this update

1153
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
Because we're having a mass

1154
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Problem

1155
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,775
With communication and this is because of the censorship

1156
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,615
Pontificate on the Mass

1157
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
Not allowed to promote our events

1158
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:36,831
On mainstream news they'll never talk about our events on TV news

1159
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,207
We're not allowed to exist on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram

1160
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
That's all we have so

1161
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
Had to call in and interrupt your broadcast night cuz

1162
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
This is the only place I can

1163
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
Remote viewing

1164
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
Bestop distill Caravan

1165
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,495
I hate to risk sounding uncaring about Owens problems

1166
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
Describing a challenge that they had to be aware of well in advance

1167
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
Spanning half the nation that you need to get people to a very tightly Time series

1168
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
Events in various cities

1169
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
Is a coordination in messaging your number one concern to do a direct mail campaign but we realize there is a

1170
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,351
Misuse their to refuse to believe that I wouldn't got out on the road and only then it hit him but he's been banned

1171
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,703
From Twitter's we can't read about their next stop and it turns out parlor isn't that great

1172
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,847
Really on the road for like an hour and he's calling in complaining about not having it

1173
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Twitter account

1174
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
This is absurd

1175
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
I love it

1176
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
Mom

1177
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
I'm running away

1178
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:41,599
Did you notice I don't have any money to get a bus ticket

1179
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,951
So turns out that I mean like they did know that they weren't on the social media sites

1180
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Kind of over

1181
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
Baton parlor being good

1182
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,351
Surprised maybe it's not

1183
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
I guess parlor

1184
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,263
Is becoming so popular right now that it's just being overwhelmed

1185
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,799
Andover inundated

1186
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,359
With people on it and it's just failing miserably

1187
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,407
I can't put out any updates on parlor

1188
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,783
Quite frankly it's extremely frustrating cuz that's what we were going to use to promote this thing but it looks like we're just going to

1189
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
The call-in here and give people updates

1190
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,367
And of course were banned everywhere else

1191
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:20,255
Soy

1192
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,095
Promote and give updates via Gab

1193
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
You're not on Tab why aren't you on cab why aren't you do you realize that

1194
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
Cabins to toxic In-N-Out fun

1195
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,711
Even you realize that but then I got hounded by all these hooking Nazis

1196
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
Calling me like a

1197
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,807
Because she'll for Israel

1198
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,463
I don't like it when you get abused online also has anybody ever noticed that there's a lot

1199
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,023
Reviews online somebody should do something

1200
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:58,399
We might go back to get it resolved they still posted

1201
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Updates on parlor

1202
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:04,543
An account with like fake information that they need an actual phone number of course

1203
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:09,151
I'm not doing anything I don't know

1204
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
It look like things were

1205
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,479
Regret

1206
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
The only thing he can do is plug

1207
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
On Infowars

1208
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
And then Wednesday Atlanta

1209
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Greenville

1210
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
South Carolina and then Thursday Raleigh North Carolina and Richmond Virginia and enforce Friday and Saturday Indy

1211
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
DC so this is the latest now again

1212
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
I want to plug the rally in Greenville South Carolina that's not on any of their Caravan itinerary

1213
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
This is weird Monday There's a map that says they have stops

1214
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
Atlanta and Columbia South Carolina on Wednesday but then

1215
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
On Tuesday

1216
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,575
I posted a map that omits

1217
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
The Columbia stop

1218
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
It's very confusing

1219
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,463
With or without parlor problems and Greenville isn't helping

1220
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,327
It kind of makes sense for the tour to go to Colombia though because that's the state capital

1221
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
And the rest of these stops

1222
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
Except for Houston are all state capitals

1223
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
It's obviously Colombia

1224
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,239
You just keep sucking up he said Greenville

1225
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,055
Charleston

1226
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Part of me thinks

1227
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
But maybe that's

1228
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,383
Just because all these rallies are really

1229
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
Up in the air out of moment

1230
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
The moment baser they could be

1231
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,039
Oh it's on this map this time and then we got a phone call and it's like

1232
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:23,903
We can only get four people to go to the VFW you still want to come and then I got don't think we can do that

1233
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
Ronaldo

1234
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,071
It's called in to complain about how he can't promote things to Deanna Lorraine

1235
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
At this point I was really needing some contacts

1236
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
Text some additional footage or information

1237
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,495
Adjust the Infowars content and luckily

1238
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,519
They're actually was

1239
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,335
Was a self-styled journalist decided to come along

1240
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
Document they're fresh

1241
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,783
Eugenius not granted this person wasn't Infowars fan

1242
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,343
Like it's still edited Down video

1243
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
But it's something

1244
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,463
And you end up with interviews like this

1245
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,375
Don't drive and Ryan I'm here adrenaline faith in God and love 0

1246
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,703
Fear and we're on a mission at the pub

1247
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,031
Divine proportions

1248
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Shell art

1249
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
Will never ever submit

1250
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
Will never submit to the commons

1251
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,903
In case you're curious why you just heard is the same guy who told the anti-feminist Joe Paterno and send off

1252
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Wild

1253
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
From a channel called

1254
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,815
Just another Channel and the guy who runs it is a dude who's called into Alex's show in the past

1255
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:40,703
I forgot his name but he's a dude basically calling Infowars employee except they don't have to pay

1256
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,775
Tractor videos from the tour that I was able to consult

1257
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
For contacts

1258
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
From his video of the Austin send-off I was able to

1259
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,663
See Owens video from another angle and it's

1260
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,479
Just as depressing from any angle as it was from straight on

1261
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:57,599
I'm not fully convinced that some of the people in the video weren't they're explicitly with Owen

1262
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,951
So same thing in organic turnout of 9 people might have been an exaggeration

1263
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
This dude

1264
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Is

1265
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Following

1266
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
Their Caravan

1267
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,375
This guy from the just another Channel

1268
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
And

1269
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
This weird dude has joke

1270
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
Hide his communist

1271
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
He's also he might as well be alright

1272
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Isaiah

1273
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
Oh my God

1274
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,687
I guess just happened too fast

1275
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,015
I feel like if they'd actually plan this would like a tour manager and stuff

1276
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,063
Somebody would have been able to pitch to like

1277
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,671
Boxer something like we're going to embed with this whole thing

1278
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,767
If there had been enough lead time I might have

1279
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,095
Risk blowing cover or whatever

1280
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:46,751
Please give me you know that I'm good at yeah yeah yeah like I could write an amazing thing

1281
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
About going

1282
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,823
You know I'd be fair yeah

1283
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,151
Tufan

1284
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
I'm a Cohen look

1285
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
Fine

1286
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
So where in Houston

1287
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,463
We've got now to streams

1288
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
Of information the Infowars stream

1289
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,583
And this other weird Dude shows going along with him

1290
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
And here is

1291
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
When is arrived in

1292
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Stephanie says the turnout

1293
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,647
Is bigger than expect

1294
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:41,791
Things are little bit more difficult to assess interns the turnout in Houston but that's just because it's nighttime

1295
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
There's no doubt that it's more people than were in Austin

1296
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
But it still looks pretty sad lullaby

1297
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Guess the number I would feel fairly comfortable in the 100 to 150 territory

1298
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:58,175
That's more than I would have got that stretches my beliefs

1299
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,479
You just another Channel video kind of

1300
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:05,855
Cheats to make the turnout look a lot bigger by recording the walk from a parking lot to Owens location in fast motion

1301
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Making it appear the all the people

1302
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
Play Pastor their 40s

1303
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
It's shaking all over the place

1304
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,839
I don't know if those people were there for Owen or not but

1305
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
It's a public

1306
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,471
Even if I give Owen the benefit of the doubt and go with the high estimate of the turnout

1307
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
It's still an embarrassing failure for info

1308
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
If they presented themselves as Scrappy upstarts

1309
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
People showing up to a rally is great

1310
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
That's not their brain

1311
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
Alex insist

1312
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
Millions upon Millions listen to him world leaders listen

1313
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,623
Domestic and international election

1314
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
Jill million-dollar high-tech Studio

1315
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,999
He should not be drawing this poorly yeah

1316
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:48,351
If you're a talented but relatively unknown, can you can draw a quarter of a house

1317
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,375
That is nothing

1318
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Ashamed

1319
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
If you're a headliner who's been in the business

1320
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,751
For 26 years and you can't fill a room

1321
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
You should stop looking

1322
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Gigs

1323
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,359
Yeah that you're going to wind up with

1324
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
The comedy Shrine in Aurora

1325
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,503
With me

1326
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,063
So it's got some good news to give this collection

1327
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,087
The Patriots in Houston

1328
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Nice-looking armored vehicle

1329
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
The armored truck right there's no way

1330
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,943
Jomashop

1331
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,015
I know when I have some good news to give an eager

1332
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,575
Your crowd of speaking to through a megaphone I'm really quick

1333
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
Distracted at the Trump impressions

1334
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
And rambling about multiple

1335
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
What car is in the Caravan

1336
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
It's amazing how the instinct

1337
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,255
IPad for time and

1338
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,839
Panties things out for no reason

1339
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,191
It's just the Style style guide

1340
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
Reminded me so much

1341
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,543
Do You Remember Have You Ever Seen The Kurt Russell

1342
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
Full speech in Miracle

1343
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
That is a

1344
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
Exactly how motivating that was

1345
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,431
That Owen just taught not very

1346
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
No it's okay

1347
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Yeah

1348
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,599
A working theory that if you work

1349
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,647
Infowars for long enough you lose the

1350
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
The ability to

1351
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:22,303
Emmaus

1352
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
Can truly in

1353
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Affect you with some

1354
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Something that you like

1355
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,447
Can't get out you know like there's a serious virus that he can

1356
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:32,287
Can break into you

1357
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
We get to the good news

1358
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,639
Stop

1359
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:46,623
Transylvania online

1360
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Lost Pennsylvania

1361
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,143
That's a great thing to say to get a crowd to cheer for you say that every time

1362
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,167
You get a big cheer

1363
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,823
It's not true but you get a big cheer you know the good news is teasing out is that Beau Biden had lost

1364
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
The electoral votes

1365
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
It's in Pennsylvania

1366
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
This is not true nor was it true that

1367
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
So this is sad

1368
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,831
I was curious what the deal was here and where this news is coming from and thankfully I didn't have to look far

1369
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:20,159
Because a source is provided in the video from just another chance

1370
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
Here again

1371
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,535
Was that weird dude who told that anti-feminist joke

1372
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Tom

1373
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
What's the news that just broke what's going on with the state some real clear politics announce that they

1374
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
They took the electoral votes away from Pennsylvania and then immediately takes him away from

1375
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:43,967
Having you both that claimed him as the winner Joe Biden oplinger

1376
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,503
Actually Trump is winning

1377
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
And he is going to

1378
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,367
So this is

1379
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
The issue here is that there's a

1380
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:53,951
Confusion inter

1381
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:00,607
What these guys are presenting is it RealClearPolitics is reporting a Pennsylvania has taken away the electoral votes from Biden

1382
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,911
That's putting the election back into play

1383
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
What they're actually claiming whether it's

1384
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,263
True or not is that real clear politics

1385
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,799
Is withdrawing their projects

1386
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,615
That Biden had won Pennsylvania's electoral votes

1387
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Which is a

1388
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:17,247
There's a bit of a misunderstanding going on here that was exacerbated by social media

1389
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
And of course Rudy Giuliani

1390
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,087
Rudy tweeted out the RealClearPolitics

1391
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
To take away their predict

1392
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
Kitchen of Biden winning Pennsylvania on November 9th

1393
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,719
Which is the news that all these people are responding

1394
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:32,095
However in the real world RealClearPolitics that never called the winter in Pennsylvania to begin with

1395
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,703
Their president Tom Bevin tweeted out on November this is false

1396
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,263
We never called Pennsylvania and nothing has

1397
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,591
The idea here is to pretend

1398
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,919
That sucks there's some PD Outlet in this case RealClearPolitics

1399
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,735
That is one of the things away from Biden and towards

1400
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
Because this creates the illusion of momentum

1401
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,855
Simple victories and no real hope.

1402
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Important

1403
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
These assholes in the right-wing propaganda

1404
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,719
Create their own fuel

1405
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,255
And this is one of the ways they do that

1406
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,607
You can see how even went on the road when doing something that's supposed to

1407
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,631
To be fun

1408
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,935
Help but spread false and misleading information

1409
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,007
All these people are equipped to do that's a real bummer

1410
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
I mean if you want to get a cheer that's a great way to do it

1411
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
It's like if you're a stand-up

1412
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
Yeah and you're like let's give it up for the truth

1413
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,063
Through this point I started to get a little bit lost

1414
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
10 Flights of Fancy

1415
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,159
I felt like Tom had really given me an assist with that one

1416
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,951
Thorson

1417
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
Yet I had no idea

1418
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Who Tom was

1419
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,303
I'm getting information from Tom

1420
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,143
He was just a weirdo in this guy's videos clearly along for the Long Haul

1421
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:45,055
Essentially he was doing exactly what I wish I was doing documenting this other nonsense except he believes all of it

1422
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,335
He's actually Zack

1423
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,175
I bet this is my deep throat revealed

1424
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Back from space

1425
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,247
Tom was going to be doing

1426
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,807
All these things that I wish I was doing

1427
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,111
Like I should get a better sense of who this guy is

1428
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,951
Figure it out figure it out

1429
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,839
Luckily they just another Channel videos use his full name and I was easily able to find his YouTube channel

1430
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:13,215
The Tom is basically an open-mic stand-up comic and his bits and what they are

1431
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,359
Haven't been through it and got hundreds and hundreds of open mics and live through the process of trying to write and work on jokes

1432
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
I really don't have an interest

1433
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
Shooting on Comics who are on their path

1434
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
I will say however that I don't

1435
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
Especially

1436
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,879
I'm not going to take up her time making fun of his dude stand-up but I can

1437
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Can't not mentioned

1438
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,207
On October 20th

1439
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
This year

1440
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,583
He posted a video of himself doing stand-up is Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat

1441
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,863
That was like

1442
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,143
2 weeks ago

1443
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,679
He's on stage

1444
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,239
I'm using the term very generous

1445
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
Who costume

1446
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
And here is one of the B

1447
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
0

1448
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
That's really not good

1449
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,095
Mailed it

1450
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,143
Spell landed

1451
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:22,335
It's a lot of costume

1452
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:28,479
Yeah he got the whole costume for one shall combo video

1453
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,879
Pinterest that joke

1454
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,903
I do care

1455
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,023
Now you got the custody of all right buddy because I can

1456
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,839
See myself in I can see myself

1457
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
A bar

1458
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,935
It like the hidden Shamrock or something

1459
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,799
Drinking at the at the the bar and a couple of the comments

1460
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
I don't know but my

1461
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,895
And he comes up and shout, then we alternate look at him

1462
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
I would like

1463
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,527
And then turn back to Arch that's exactly

1464
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,879
Doing that huh

1465
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,743
Probably should have worked on the writing

1466
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,095
Tended you have a shout-out

1467
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,983
Now here's a really a joke

1468
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:29,407
If you have a good joke you don't need to Costco you don't need a car if you don't have a great joke you do need a costume

1469
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
And this still is iffy

1470
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:38,623
Anyway that's the guy who's along for the Long Haul

1471
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
At The Shrine

1472
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,487
So I hear back to in Houston

1473
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
And he tells

1474
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
He tells them this

1475
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
To give them

1476
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
The real sense of meaning

1477
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
And what they're doing

1478
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,359
Can you look in the mirror

1479
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:05,759
America right now

1480
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
Nationwide

1481
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:19,071
They would not have callback Pennsylvania and they already would have called Georgia and North Carolina Arizona and Nevada

1482
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
So you heard Alex

1483
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
Guys claim they like

1484
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,543
Trump fighting is because he saw them at Austin and

1485
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
When is

1486
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
To give the audience

1487
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Same grandiose

1488
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,991
100 people showing up at a park in Houston

1489
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
Is the reason

1490
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
That the globalists

1491
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,159
Cook-Out electoral votes in Pennsylvania away from fighting

1492
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
These men

1493
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,999
Later in their life Shelf

1494
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:54,399
Sleep wondering what will become of a shame that they were not here with us on this st. crispin's day

1495
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:02,847
I want protect

1496
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
Zen d.c.

1497
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,455
Good luck

1498
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,551
I know that there's about to be over

1499
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
American Standard

1500
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,703
When when

1501
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,879
Hellboy

1502
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,231
Surprisingly large percentage of Ellen speech

1503
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,279
When is the crab breaking into usa-chan

1504
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:57,375
Honestly I thought were kind of satirical than I was young

1505
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
You know I felt like a high number of the people who doing USA chance were mocking like making fun of the people who

1506
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,663
Stupidly yellow USA

1507
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Inexplicably like

1508
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:16,575
I feel like they've reclaimed it

1509
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
An inspiring speech Owen doesn't really have much gas left in the tank

1510
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,511
Just trying to pry

1511
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
Chance and talk about

1512
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,119
Very not true news from Pennsylvania that's basically at

1513
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,167
Here's a little taste of him from about minutes

1514
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,495
Just seems like he's falling back on like

1515
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,519
Platitudes whatever

1516
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,015
Starbucks

1517
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:57,023
Are we going to be free to let him know.

1518
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:07,519
Steve Madden will deny the Cox

1519
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
Pro 3 tides

1520
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
So at this point

1521
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
The rally and

1522
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,711
And I start to realize first of all these turnouts

1523
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,527
They were the first two

1524
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
You're not good

1525
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
No better

1526
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
Cookie batter

1527
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
Are you

1528
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
Realize that I had really over thought things when I was talking with her itinerary

1529
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,007
We can do this

1530
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,615
Stop all right we're going to get out of here you got to keep on fighting the good fight

1531
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,175
I was thinking it was actually like

1532
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,503
You're not working to coordinate we're going to meet up with stealing

1533
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,783
If it's nothing

1534
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
Just show up

1535
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,903
This just another Channel guy will go around a videotape

1536
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
Some people

1537
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,487
It's following them called the hippies4trump

1538
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,303
Of course

1539
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,863
White dudes with dreadlocks

1540
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
I hastily slept together

1541
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
And I'm just starting

1542
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,615
Love it

1543
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,711
And we wake up

1544
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
And again

1545
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,551
I will never know if David Nye cover this on his show

1546
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:28,671
Episode of The Alex Jones program

1547
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
Or he's bent out of shape

1548
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,535
About our globalist named Klaus Schwab

1549
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,095
Klaus Schwab

1550
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
World

1551
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
No more police no more meat no more travel

1552
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
We'll be lucky if you're alive wait till

1553
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
And you're going to do about it

1554
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,223
Les Schwab is the head of the world economic Forum that erode book earlier this year called the Great reset

1555
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:58,879
Some of the ideas in night were further explored in that online presentation that we discussed on the past episodes of Beyond need to get to deepen

1556
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,439
That's what we talked about

1557
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Video that I did

1558
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
With that dumb

1559
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:09,631
This book is not Schwab saying that you can't have meat anymore or any of that b*******

1560
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
It's a complex

1561
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,519
Examination of interconnected forces that have been disrupted or altered by the Coronavirus

1562
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Ameritemps

1563
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
Define possible solution

1564
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
Some trends that might be expected to BC

1565
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:24,479
I just don't care about Alex's inability to read anymore

1566
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
He's someone who can't be trusted to get the

1567
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
The point of a young adult

1568
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Sci-fi novel so it's

1569
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
Really crucial

1570
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
To understand that when it comes

1571
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,951
To Something Like A Book Like This

1572
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:38,047
He truly can't handle the material doesn't realize that

1573
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,095
His teacher was not actually an alien

1574
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,375
In the book

1575
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,447
Caesar was an alien but I all teachers were

1576
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,519
Goosebumps

1577
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
When Schwab

1578
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:55,199
Discusses how things are never going back to normal again he's saying that the state we were in early 2020 is not a state that we're working

1579
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
To return to

1580
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
We can't be

1581
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Because that's

1582
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Impossible

1583
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,343
The idea that we have some kind of quote-unquote normal is

1584
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Isn't a real thing

1585
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,695
You know it and when we end up wherever we end up

1586
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
That will be the result of decision

1587
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
We're making now

1588
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,303
How we respond to the challenges

1589
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
The pandemic

1590
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
As well as various aspects

1591
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
Of life that it affect

1592
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:18,751
Honestly from what I've read about the book it seems like one of the largest points he has it about

1593
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,055
I think about how things will be different in the future

1594
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,615
Is it there's going to be a trend away from globalization

1595
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
The thinking

1596
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
Is that what

1597
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
That makes the virus response

1598
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
So difficult

1599
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,271
Is it everything is interconnect

1600
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,087
So it's very hard to slow things down in one area of life

1601
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,647
Without affecting every other one in this

1602
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
You would expect

1603
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Toledo

1604
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
Towards a less connect

1605
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Did world

1606
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
Because

1607
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
It would

1608
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
More

1609
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,399
I don't know bility to have one thing Fall Apart

1610
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
I think the one thing that

1611
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,751
Conservatives have absolutely

1612
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,823
Dominated as far as messaging goes is like

1613
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
This idea that

1614
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
Even acceptable to talk

1615
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
Talk about

1616
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
An older

1617
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,503
Time as being normal or or status

1618
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
Like at no point like

1619
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:07,903
Oh let's go back to when America was great or or anything like that the 1950s regret

1620
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
It wasn't

1621
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,207
Find it was constantly in flux

1622
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Then and then

1623
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,511
Change Dylan's going to

1624
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,815
Keep changing

1625
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
But that's just how it is

1626
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,935
Yeah how can you even have a conversation where people are like

1627
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,727
Let's live like we did back then

1628
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:27,871
So you can take like this guy saying we're never going back to quote unquote

1629
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Mexican pretend that that means that

1630
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
There's no police on me while traveling more

1631
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
You really means is

1632
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Something that

1633
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
The future is unpredictable

1634
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
Pitbull and we have the ability to

1635
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,391
Make better decisions now

1636
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,207
Although this is terrible what's happening right now

1637
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Disruption

1638
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
Are there are there occasions and opportunities for us

1639
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
To do

1640
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,375
Things

1641
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Better better

1642
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Dum Dums

1643
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,215
Tired of saying I told you so listen

1644
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,263
Listen to us before you do the dump

1645
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:00,895
Again I stress Alex Jones is unable or unwilling to wrestle with complex ideas

1646
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
So what he does instead

1647
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,991
Is that he takes his fantasies and bizarre notion

1648
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,783
How many presents them has researched

1649
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Studied facts

1650
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
He's dumb

1651
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,135
But being dumb isn't something to shame someone

1652
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
14

1653
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
He makes

1654
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:17,023
Is living through the weaponization of his ignorant to something that is just repulsive

1655
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
And I cannot forget

1656
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:22,143
NSX brake really weirdly

1657
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,959
Elizabeth might down for this cuz I want you to pay attention

1658
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,983
Temperature I am

1659
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
Dead certain that he met

1660
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,567
To plug and I think you'll agree with me

1661
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,871
Is it absolutely supposed to be a butthead.

1662
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,967
Why do you got to stay on there now more than ever

1663
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
I hope Trump

1664
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
But we've got a build and be faithful

1665
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,159
Impossible

1666
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,975
It's so bad that even those are delusional

1667
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,327
Euthanize

1668
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:57,983
And they'll just finally go home and we grown army robots

1669
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
I got a mop up plan

1670
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
The biotech

1671
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
And then

1672
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,063
Real weapons

1673
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,623
I will be so absolutely

1674
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,439
Humans are very strong

1675
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
Reply back

1676
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,791
And I said

1677
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,327
Most people nurse will be.

1678
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,399
Hope you all enjoy it

1679
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
How to kill you and your fam

1680
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,359
Running around screaming nightwatch Dayton

1681
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,687
God is going to hurt them so

1682
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
Damn that

1683
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,623
Paul Joseph Watson on the other side infowars.com

1684
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
100%

1685
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:50,463
A couple points during that

1686
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,071
He had met to jump to an a******

1687
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
Bramble about everyone

1688
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,375
Going to die at least

1689
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,727
Four times where I guarantee I was supposed to hear and that's why we need your help

1690
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,031
That's why we need your support that was supposed to be

1691
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,615
The further reinforces that is

1692
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
As soon as he comes back from break

1693
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Taquitos applaud

1694
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,479
I'm pretty sure that you would like

1695
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
Buckeye blue

1696
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,319
Alex talks to a Paul Joseph Watson

1697
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
And I don't care

1698
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,367
I only have the

1699
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,671
This clip in because it demonstrates

1700
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
This is Vanessa

1701
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,719
And Alex

1702
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,303
Still doesn't know that Pfizer vaccine is a mRNA vaccine

1703
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,935
Waldo in Olivehurst

1704
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
It's excuse to end the Great reset

1705
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,687
But they're saying no don't take it now you got to take

1706
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,759
100 times more dangerous next year so there

1707
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,039
Completely transparent

1708
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,135
Another difference either

1709
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
Who cares

1710
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Why would they look it up

1711
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
They look it up

1712
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:59,583
Alex made it up on the spot he was just guessing there's a 50-50 chance maybe he was right or not right with it

1713
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:05,983
Serena's next clip Alex discusses lying to a woman that he saw in public about mass at the receipts

1714
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,263
Gaslight the s*** out of her

1715
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,567
By the way people are in such fear

1716
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,127
A few weeks ago that I know now

1717
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,199
And I said

1718
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Has Bill Gates said he wants you to work

1719
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
She started crying

1720
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
And she said don't be mean to me

1721
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,439
I just parked

1722
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
People are so emotional about this

1723
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Man

1724
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,351
You are an a******

1725
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:39,519
It's because everyone is so emotional that's why everyone always says you're attacking me and then starts crying

1726
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:45,919
It's because of them every time it has something to do with me in this like sort of mental

1727
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,991
To be heroic story of Alex's game

1728
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Giant

1729
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,831
People who suck

1730
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,391
Rodger Stone shows up

1731
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,719
I will say I'm pretty sure he's drunk

1732
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:02,047
I think he's doing he has a giant cigar

1733
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,863
Halfway through the interview he puts on a big pair of glasses

1734
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:11,263
Sunglasses inside

1735
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:17,664
Job he's not getting a new one from anybody who got it fired and Trump's going to lose

1736
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:22,784
Rodger stone is a smartplug library

1737
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,320
The stop this feel

1738
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,416
He joins us from Florida Rodger thank you so much for taking time out to answer

1739
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,720
So he has his plan for how this could

1740
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,792
Could still work out using operation

1741
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
Hasn't won yet

1742
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
People who say that he has

1743
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Right

1744
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:42,240
Similar to another group that's in denial about something

1745
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,616
Deeper you dig you know that they do they like Holocaust

1746
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
Despicable

1747
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,480
He kept insisting no no there is no evidence of

1748
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,344
He's going to be

1749
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
So

1750
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:03,744
People who are not buying your arguments about election fraud are similar to Holocaust deniers which are repulsed

1751
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
Tell Alex about that a lot of people who deny the Holocaust

1752
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
9 in a good way

1753
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
I like this election

1754
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,240
I don't know if there's any

1755
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
Single

1756
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,592
Source of entertainment that I viewed in my life

1757
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,664
It had more Holocaust deniers on it then Infowars

1758
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,688
If cheers

1759
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
Not sure about the

1760
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
The percentage

1761
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,904
I would say if you exclude the History Channel

1762
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
That's so dumb does like their languages

1763
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Is always the

1764
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,000
The f****** both disgust

1765
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
Make impossibly

1766
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,584
Like I said it goes both ways to it's like Mitch

1767
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,168
McConnell likes with reference Martin Luther King jr.

1768
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
Speech about how

1769
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,240
Is unveiling a bill to bring back slavery

1770
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,800
That's how awful they really are

1771
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,336
You're not wrong

1772
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,664
So in the next Clipper Rodger kind of rewrites

1773
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,688
The party swap

1774
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,968
From the 6

1775
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,272
I don't think he's making a whole lot of sun

1776
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,856
The South and the Deep South have been a

1777
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
Christian conservative values

1778
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:10,048
They used to be Democratic in the old days until

1779
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,888
Conservative Democrats saw the error of the left-wing

1780
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,728
Now communist infiltration

1781
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,520
And there are there

1782
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:20,800
Blursed

1783
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,896
And they had already moved around Reagan Richard Nixon

1784
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
Southern military tradition here

1785
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:39,232
It goes all the way but we have a Great Southern military tradition to goes all the way back

1786
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Beginning of the United

1787
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,352
Military people here in the south

1788
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:49,472
No idea why I'm bringing that up I know that out there

1789
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,032
Just indicative of that very standard

1790
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
Sort of belief

1791
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,152
In the anti-communist wings of the right way

1792
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Sweeter

1793
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,480
That is easy

1794
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,504
These civil rights

1795
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,040
Its movements were really

1796
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Communist

1797
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
I mean

1798
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,392
Rodger Stone one

1799
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
The people who helped

1800
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Create

1801
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,304
The southern strategy built entirely on whipping people up about race

1802
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,864
Compare to be like they saw the error of their ways

1803
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,400
F*** you Rodger

1804
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:24,800
Narrow Victory to Victory any hints that has something to do

1805
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,360
Do with electors or something

1806
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,176
Patriots understand that the last

1807
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,736
In this process is the

1808
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,040
Legislature certifying

1809
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Who is the elect

1810
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,136
Who will go to the Electoral College

1811
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
Under Jus cause

1812
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,792
I'll bet they are in fact

1813
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,632
They are who are shooting for

1814
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
If you understand

1815
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,240
Yes sir not interrupting cuz I want you to get all out

1816
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,288
Idem in yes

1817
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
The electors are

1818
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,664
What his his argument is I think

1819
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Is

1820
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,992
We can use these legislators to force

1821
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Electors

1822
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:11,136
Is that will vote for Trump even when they're supposed to be pledged B

1823
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,952
Furiously disgusting

1824
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
Did with this

1825
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,792
You cannot spend a year telling me that this

1826
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,816
This is life-or-death

1827
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,352
And we're fighting the devil

1828
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
And then be like

1829
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,216
Well if we can use the vagaries of the f****** concert

1830
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
Institution Dave

1831
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,288
Trick our way into the presidency

1832
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,336
No no you can't like then

1833
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:34,944
You didn't read us his rights before he got elected president

1834
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,016
12 hour booking

1835
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,576
Cinderella solution to this f****** problem

1836
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
Okay the devil

1837
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
Rodger

1838
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
I will say

1839
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:51,328
There's reasons not to take him too seriously to definitely

1840
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,448
Sidney Powell

1841
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,472
Correctly

1842
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,336
A very invasive

1843
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,896
Droll

1844
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,432
Essentially surveillance

1845
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
Abuse

1846
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
Which had

1847
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,040
Corrupted

1848
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,600
Has been able to manipulate

1849
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,392
True a

1850
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,672
Who is scorecard

1851
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,256
Program that was specifically designed to work

1852
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
To the back doors of the

1853
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:27,168
Rogers on nasm Dennis Montgomery

1854
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,984
I think the worst part of that is he's telling it like he

1855
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,544
He half remembers what it's supposed to be about

1856
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:38,944
F***** up yeah and then he's just filling in the blanks where he doesn't remember the yeah he doesn't know what it even is out of

1857
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,344
Getzen Ethan vicious it's an invasion

1858
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,184
He's promoting the stop the steal stuff

1859
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
You're involved

1860
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,024
I know you're involved

1861
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:59,424
I don't know what's going on

1862
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
Somehow I'm sure that

1863
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
Totally

1864
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
This is my favorite

1865
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
Is there such good comedy

1866
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
I could not have written

1867
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
This myself

1868
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,384
The universe had to create

1869
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Is 4 MI

1870
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,176
This is Alex

1871
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Cuz last question

1872
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Temperature

1873
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
I have one more question

1874
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
What does Trump need to do

1875
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,880
If you're drowning in debt you can't afford

1876
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,232
I got one last question for you

1877
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:27,072
Is Trump getting the light I'm sorry we're going to have to go

1878
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
Every time magic metallics

1879
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
Imagine that what he's saying is true

1880
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,264
And that world leaders listen to his show

1881
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,080
Alex is talking to Rodger Stone

1882
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,104
Trump is watching

1883
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,432
What's what's the last thing I need to know what is he have to

1884
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,224
Call in to the show to get there

1885
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,272
Analysis to be taking a nap

1886
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:52,672
So it's not going to be able to do if that's why he always misses the part that he wants to hear and Alex's just done with the show

1887
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,512
Oh man that's brutal

1888
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,536
The Rogers gone

1889
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,328
View

1890
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,352
Jordan

1891
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,144
I mean you're not in the city where you

1892
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
You could

1893
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,776
If you were in one of the cities along the Route Seattle near the karazhan on if you don't join

1894
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
You're crazy

1895
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,848
Tallahassee tonight about 8

1896
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,920
Florida

1897
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,944
Florida loves

1898
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,712
Liberty

1899
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,272
Gas up the car drive up the next few days with us

1900
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,808
Stay in DC for this event

1901
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,856
Baby don't you're crazy

1902
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,464
Because this is all about visuals and it's all about going up there and it's all about standing

1903
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
CC in d.c.

1904
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
We are running

1905
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
The emergency sale

1906
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,192
It's all about visual sure

1907
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,752
That's very clear we know

1908
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
When is back on now

1909
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,896
And a little interview from the road

1910
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
Moving van

1911
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,224
He describes

1912
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,296
Kind of what's going on and I don't understand how

1913
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
This is any different than a

1914
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,648
Who what you're describing is a coup

1915
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,952
So you had Donald Trump

1916
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,256
President of the United States

1917
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
You've now had essentially for all intensive

1918
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,328
Purposes

1919
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Mike Pompeo the Secretary of

1920
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,400
Penn State playing

1921
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
He's one

1922
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
And you have about 70 million Americans

1923
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,056
I think millions of which could be in d.c. this weekend

1924
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
Flaming Trump

1925
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
1

1926
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,128
Queer eye

1927
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,920
So you have Trump

1928
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:21,504
Declaring himself the winner of an election that the

1929
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,296
13 sentences with

1930
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Ensure

1931
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,856
You have a secretary of state

1932
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,904
Lackey

1933
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
Saying A1 right

1934
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,744
And then you also have

1935
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
Large groups of supporters who are very angry

1936
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
Who are saying

1937
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,144
None of that proves that he won

1938
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,192
Exactly what you would have

1939
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
Expect in the case of like

1940
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Someone who lost

1941
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
Usher claiming that they want

1942
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
Right

1943
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
But

1944
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
But

1945
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
But

1946
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
But

1947
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
Spot

1948
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,968
Hey

1949
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
It might be

1950
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,808
It might be in my nappy

1951
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:02,208
Literally ate forgotten about that now literally a group of people getting in the car trying to grab more

1952
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,488
Read more supporters in order

1953
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
Where to

1954
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,328
Essentially put Siege to the White House

1955
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,936
Until until they take over the country

1956
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,728
Yes with bull horns

1957
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Now Jordan

1958
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
My favorite

1959
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Thing

1960
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,456
I know that I said that last clip with Rodger where it cut. Cut off short favorite thing sure

1961
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,808
Probably the finest moment episode it's possible

1962
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,880
When is just complaining about voter fraud and what have you

1963
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
And then this happen

1964
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,256
They see them counting in Pennsylvania in

1965
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,752
Well we lost Owen

1966
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
What's this

1967
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,920
Easy hamburger

1968
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
Hamburger place

1969
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,528
So good

1970
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,928
What is this happens a lot

1971
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:11,328
This happens a lot but this is I think the first time or maybe it's one of the few times that I was has been forced to like

1972
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,632
Actually real

1973
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
I'm sorry

1974
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
A Cheesy hamburger

1975
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,496
Cheeseburger

1976
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
Basically like your hamburgers

1977
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,872
Cheesy

1978
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,152
Goes out

1979
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,320
I got to own up to this cheeseburger

1980
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,648
His defense

1981
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,744
Honestly this is the best cheeseburger I've ever eaten so frankly I'll dude you guys

1982
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
The favored by

1983
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,072
Eating a cheeseburger

1984
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,376
It's too good now

1985
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:49,472
Shows up what needs to happen

1986
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:54,080
Is declassify everything

1987
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:58,176
I think he's on the verge of doing what Ivan

1988
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,712
What is the class

1989
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,696
Vermont

1990
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,256
Hepatitis C before the election

1991
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,584
Declassify destroy Brennan is a foreign agent

1992
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,656
Destroyer Destroyer

1993
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
And that's why they're now calling for a

1994
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:28,640
So I guess the idea is that what they now W is for Trump to prove all there

1995
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,176
Conspiracy

1996
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,456
I'm sure he's going to do

1997
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
Personally

1998
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
Would love it

1999
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,832
If you just be classified Alki

2000
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:42,208
Of all the things that he could do as a spite move on his way out of office

2001
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,256
That's the one I'm most in favor of

2002
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
As long as it was

2003
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
Like really very strong

2004
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,936
Strategically targeted like alien ship or whatever

2005
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,984
Just something that like

2006
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,544
You're going down the hill Kennedy

2007
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
The whole thing

2008
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,736
Absolute let the chips fall where they may

2009
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
Exactly

2010
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,368
They're going to probably not coming out

2011
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,440
Store Road says this and I feel like

2012
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
I like it the motor responses

2013
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,768
That's not cool

2014
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,104
Secure

2015
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,016
And we're starting out we're going to be

2016
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,064
And we'll be there I'll be inside BC

2017
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
Prepare to go in

2018
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,744
History

2019
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,512
Cool boy

2020
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
Yeah that's not

2021
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,072
No that's really f***** up

2022
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,912
Yeah Stewart Road leader of The Oath Keepers have an army

2023
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,704
Of armed man ready

2024
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,384
Yeah I'm going to be honest it sounds sounds real blustery yeah a little bit ago and he's playing on this one

2025
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
Most likely but

2026
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:13,600
Such a scary Prospect yet I still feel the need to take him a little seriously

2027
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,648
No cuss people the cosplayers with

2028
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
Giant heavy swords

2029
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
Even if they're

2030
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
They're heavy

2031
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,792
They can still hurt somebody makes me a compass

2032
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,560
They don't have

2033
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,096
Guns guns are worse

2034
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
These guys do that

2035
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:31,264
The thing I think is really funny about this interview is that Owen earlier said

2036
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,664
Bowser mayor Bowser we have to keep him out of BC apparently that was in reference to like covid

2037
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
Restrictions

2038
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,248
Yeah you have to quarantine me

2039
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:47,648
Stewart roses interviews

2040
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,976
Narrative

2041
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,792
So now we're done with

2042
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:59,680
The show itself again not very good so is not satisfying and in many ways

2043
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:06,080
The little things come up Alex eating a cheeseburger registering probably drunk doing an interview when he was eating

2044
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:12,480
Geez ring got caught did he like make a face to the camera didn't bug you or would like a little unfortunately there isn't video

2045
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,528
Video of a meeting the cheeseburgers

2046
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,808
Disappoint

2047
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,344
Just like

2048
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,232
It's Owen's shot and then the camera goes out and then a big Sony logo

2049
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
It's

2050
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,096
The three-dimensional

2051
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,144
Yeah we pick up

2052
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,680
With Owen on the road

2053
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,496
He's on his way to Baton Rouge

2054
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
Stick in French

2055
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:41,152
Rouge Louisiana

2056
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:48,320
All right ladies and gentlemen Owen Shroyer here from infowars.com stop the steel Caravan in

2057
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
Baton Rouge Louisiana

2058
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,928
Car

2059
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,696
Of the day

2060
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Before we get to

2061
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
Tallahassee

2062
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
Florida this evening

2063
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
So I'm not sure where

2064
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
Our people may be out here because there is no real parking

2065
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,264
And they have kind of

2066
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,080
Capitol grounds shut down

2067
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Drive around

2068
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,432
See if we've got a caravan

2069
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,736
Otherwise

2070
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Pick a parking lot

2071
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,600
Oh and can't find his people

2072
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,880
Which is a bad sign

2073
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,376
Because we were very confident

2074
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:36,448
That we had planned everything but we realized

2075
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,472
Just now

2076
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,776
Oh that's right we're very.

2077
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,080
Part of meetups is where

2078
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:45,920
Where is the first question usually that you want to take care of

2079
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,224
Text 31 Brazil Google Maps

2080
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
The folks

2081
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
I would say that his response is

2082
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
Tepid

2083
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,696
Hello Baton Rouge

2084
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,536
Infowars

2085
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,888
Are the solid clock

2086
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:15,360
I can tell there's a turnout of about twenty-five and Baton Rouge for Owens arrival at only one of them had hands with wings

2087
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,944
The other ones were holding like Gadsden flags and s***

2088
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,552
Owen's Beach in a Baton Rouge is incredibly boring so I checked

2089
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:29,952
Just another channel that was useless to Cajun impression

2090
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:37,120
I would say that this stop on the Convoy was even waste of time for both of us

2091
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,912
And Owen

2092
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,216
It was a zero

2093
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,520
Is the Kong

2094
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,824
Is labeled B and lost

2095
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,104
Pennsylvania

2096
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
I think we've got enough

2097
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,624
This is probably not a good question

2098
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
And ask

2099
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,720
All the time

2100
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
Dumb

2101
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
Democrats

2102
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
They celebrated

2103
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
They find one

2104
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
And now he

2105
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
How dumb do you

2106
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
Make a filbert how dumb

2107
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
Do they feel they probably

2108
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,800
So yeah so I'm not sure if they can

2109
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,968
I like the feeling you said this was a

2110
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:30,368
Sting operation that I should feel dumb just a couple days ago people reported this

2111
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
Huh

2112
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
Strange how I feel stupid about that to the people over there and

2113
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,424
And one guy comes up and he says

2114
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
We had a million people in

2115
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,520
DC and a million people all across this country

2116
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,312
Getting up on freeways

2117
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
Putting the Bears over having 10,000

2118
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
Every hour

2119
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,920
We don't need a media

2120
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,944
Social media weekend

2121
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Do-it-yourself

2122
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,248
Is a multi-front battle of

2123
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
You're not going to.

2124
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Can you pick a bridge

2125
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,576
Did you get on it you do it you do whatever

2126
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,344
Everyday

2127
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,368
Got2b

2128
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Are you go

2129
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
We are the media now

2130
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:13,120
We are the media now we are the media now we've taking the bridges

2131
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,240
They can they put

2132
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,032
Like a little paper cups

2133
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:25,152
Inside of the fence on Bridges took how to spell out a message to wait wait for them to learn about

2134
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
Pamphlets

2135
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:30,528
They're the media now they got bridge in all right

2136
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:36,928
Alex

2137
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,512
I can get this would write something something

2138
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,560
Biden

2139
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,608
Victory is brutal

2140
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,192
But the turnout at these rallies is a brutality

2141
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:55,104
As as good as that other dude is acting like he just had a Babality

2142
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
That was a joke

2143
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,992
This is a statement

2144
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,856
Is Baton Rouge rally in

2145
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,648
Play audience for a message

2146
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,416
Stalex

2147
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Just say something

2148
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
Send Alex Jones because

2149
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,768
Because I'll tell you you know I work for Dallas

2150
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,536
For a long time

2151
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:14,816
And

2152
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
Play tied into this

2153
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
It's hard even under

2154
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,752
So just give him a little word

2155
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
Encouragement

2156
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
PC

2157
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
America

2158
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
Tell Alex

2159
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,720
So there's a hippies for Trump event along this whole tour

2160
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,048
Your words are going on too long

2161
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,424
Here's another this was a fun little Mexican Alex from the audience

2162
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,776
Joe Rogan dead

2163
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,896
John the Baptist

2164
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:09,088
You're you're laughing over another guy thing you're the John the Baptist of this movement

2165
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:15,488
Oh boy there's nothing funnier than you like Joe Rogan be like Joe Rogan

2166
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,792
The harsh fact checker

2167
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,864
And that's kind of the problem with like doing it halfway

2168
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,936
Yeah it's because then you have the appearance of Alex

2169
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,216
Coming out of that on

2170
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,776
Scabies

2171
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:31,104
Gave you through everything against the wall and Alex

2172
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,456
States that is a really bad Optical thing

2173
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:37,248
Give out

2174
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,296
Now I hate to say that

2175
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:41,856
Piss you off

2176
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,160
This is probably a me because you're a lid

2177
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,000
You know this is really probably going to be like

2178
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,304
No but it's going to be like you're going to just

2179
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:54,400
The hair on the back of your neck is going to stand up your punching my wall broken

2180
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
I pledge allegiance

2181
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
Recite the pledge

2182
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,016
Another step to Anchor

2183
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:15,136
Guys guys

2184
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,744
It's funny when they don't actually know or meet any live

2185
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,792
I'm sure so they get this weird like

2186
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,096
Created version of the liver

2187
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:30,496
Is being like terrified of the Pledge of Allegiance they respond to the pledge like of vampires do to garlic

2188
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,312
Where is like

2189
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,384
Repeat that you can't get this like that we're just like

2190
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,176
But you man nobody's nobody's

2191
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:38,944
Mad

2192
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,992
At the Pledge of Allegiance stop

2193
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Probably unsurprisingly though that has ended

2194
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,624
We pray right now.

2195
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Pray that you hear this

2196
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
Raise up

2197
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,744
Donald Trump

2198
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Continue

2199
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Be your king

2200
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:57,376
We're standing in unity right now we come together in the name

2201
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,936
Well then we pray that you

2202
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
All demonic

2203
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
Sebring for a trip to Romania

2204
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,544
King

2205
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Good good

2206
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,872
This is me God

2207
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,200
I would choose someone who can stand better

2208
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:15,808
So the turnout in Tallahassee that which is the next stop I'll go to her

2209
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,624
It doesn't appear to be much better than the previous event

2210
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,720
But again it's night time so be pretty difficult to gauge the exact number

2211
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,816
Could be absolutely I would be shocked

2212
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,352
If there were 200

2213
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,448
Kind of the ceiling I would go to

2214
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,240
Needtobreathe turn out for an indie band

2215
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,288
But it's a terrible turnout for Infowars

2216
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,896
Somebody individual close-up shots don't look too bad but the people are packed in

2217
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,664
Pretty close

2218
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,968
Also if you watch the video you're going to notice

2219
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,504
Glaring and that is

2220
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,296
Literally no one's wearing a mask

2221
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,600
That's something that our friend Tom

2222
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,136
What is actually pretty stoked about

2223
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:57,792
Distance from here to come to Florida no mask mandate one of that

2224
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:04,192
Feels like freedom is a totally change of energy

2225
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,472
Amazing

2226
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:11,872
That's right completely unrelated Florida state with the third highest number of covid-19 cases

2227
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,152
Steph

2228
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:16,992
It's like if Typhoid Mary was actually a political movement

2229
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,088
If you're Owen you can probably feel a little bit better

2230
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,880
About your arrival in Tallahassee

2231
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,720
But not because it's amazing but because the other events were so bad

2232
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,000
They're so damned

2233
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,560
This is kind of like okay

2234
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,096
You have you have some

2235
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,888
Stuff you can work with your

2236
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
Payless

2237
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:41,568
Then it should be if all the other things about what you do you say about what you do are accurate

2238
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,336
But fine

2239
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,384
I'm not I'm not too mad it look like

2240
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,920
Get people having a good time

2241
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,200
In Tallahassee

2242
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,480
So they go to

2243
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,272
And we wake up

2244
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
And

2245
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
November 11th

2246
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,904
Again I don't know if David night covered any of this

2247
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,928
I'll never know how okay

2248
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,744
Be at the Alex's show and I was expecting like

2249
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,512
Some big news

2250
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
From the road

2251
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,096
Instead we get something altogether different

2252
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,400
He's coming on

2253
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,984
Get the f*** out of the show they were going to fire

2254
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,544
And I have the CIA and others

2255
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,824
Did you hear that

2256
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:20,480
Steve is coming on 2 days ago it was an operation

2257
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:26,880
Baby got something right 2 days ago

2258
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,864
Are you people do you talk

2259
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,632
This is

2260
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:42,496
Outrageous send a text message

2261
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:46,336
I'm out

2262
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:50,944
Turns out you can f*** over Owen it's not that big of a deal anything on war room

2263
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
Because Noah

2264
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,528
Yeah I think it's a small audience

2265
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:58,368
If there aren't really any steaks to it

2266
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,928
Can choose to have Steve on or not

2267
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,488
She has a tiny audience even better

2268
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,048
You can sit all over because

2269
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:06,816
Give the s*** anyway

2270
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:12,448
Caught up talking about how black lives matter are Aunt Jemima

2271
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,216
Vans

2272
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:16,800
Well you're not

2273
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
DC black lives matter

2274
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,432
I'll look like Aunt Jemima they are folks they are literally

2275
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:25,248
Marxist-leninist Satan worshipers who follow me

2276
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
I'll say tongue

2277
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,320
And said they hate men's very existence

2278
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:30,112
The only good man is a castrated man

2279
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,184
And their main Sacrament is no family

2280
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
He doesn't doesn't break

2281
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,056
The syrup was

2282
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,104
Pro that we weren't aware of

2283
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,408
I don't know okay I think this is all just

2284
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,224
Weird weird weird races

2285
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
Alex

2286
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,624
I got to say in terms of

2287
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,160
Satire

2288
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
He's not good at it

2289
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,744
Set pieces that he does

2290
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,328
Not good no this is about as well done

2291
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,352
As a joke

2292
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:16,704
Is ever been on his show this is where he declares himself bread

2293
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,752
He declares himself president

2294
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
Like I think

2295
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,568
I feel like this is all right

2296
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
Really freaked out

2297
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:25,920
Self-esteem

2298
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,688
President-elect

2299
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,344
Fraud but that's what

2300
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
Scammers

2301
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,160
Or trying to do because her past hoaxes

2302
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,184
FL

2303
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
I got some good news for you

2304
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,680
The United States

Here we are ladies and gentlemen thank you

He was the 44th president

2308
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,016
Miss

2309
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,064
History

2310
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,392
Chinese Communist globalization

2311
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,952
No all you got to do is

2312
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,280
You are a

2313
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,560
Allowed to announce the winner

2314
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,864
But no one else is

2315
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
The president

2316
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,264
And so

2317
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,896
The presidential seal on it and you are

2318
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:29,920
The president

2319
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,992
45th president stays Alexander Emery

2320
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
Jones

2321
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
Texas

2322
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:41,184
Before you say anything as time

2323
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
Went to Long

2324
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:48,608
Over explain the joke totally as usual made me think it was good

2325
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:53,984
Yeah yeah it was alright

2326
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
Slips to being a joke

2327
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:58,848
Music you with at the right time

2328
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:05,248
That that was what tricked me into forgetting that it went to fucanglong

2329
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,528
Gives you a little but

2330
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
Subway

2331
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
Search

2332
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
Terrible

2333
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,000
Okay we've announced it on the president and

2334
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:22,400
You know that because I've simulated what a normal news Outlet would look like you know that you can do the

2335
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,168
This because there's a

2336
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,192
The blue background

2337
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:28,800
And on top of the blue background there's a logo and I'm front of the logo there's a flag

2338
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
Get in front of the flag

2339
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,592
There's an eagle

2340
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:34,688
I know the music guys like

2341
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
This joke really working for you

2342
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,760
This is SNL right

2343
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,832
Yeah I would say that it's a rare

2344
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,112
Day in Austin

2345
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:42,880
When

2346
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,672
Acuzat Infowars work

2347
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,232
That might have blinded extra

2348
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,816
Astro so Alex has some problems with

2349
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:53,632
The voter fraud people not believing

2350
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
Their story

2351
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:57,984
USPS

2352
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Post-dating

2353
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,032
Balance

2354
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,592
After the election

2355
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,664
Saying that they were

2356
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,456
Before the election

2357
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,480
Brother-in-law

2358
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,696
Commercial

2359
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,000
Working with the post office

2360
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:26,400
I don't care about Alex's dumb brother-in-law however I do want to touch on this whistleblower from the USPS but Alex is referring to

2361
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:31,776
This is the subject of project Veritas is latest polish APO guy named Richard Hopkins

2362
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,640
Hopkins claim that he was instructed by his postmaster in Pennsylvania to backdate pallets

2363
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:38,176
The came in after the election

2364
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,480
His death has been used by many

2365
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,016
And far more official Avenue

2366
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,320
Claims they're solid evidence that illegal ballots

2367
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
Come again

2368
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
However

2369
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
The Inspector General of the US

2370
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,672
PS spoke to her

2371
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,720
And Hopkins told them that quote

2372
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:54,048
The allegations were not true any signed affidavit

2373
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,072
Camping his claim

2374
01:49:56,096 --> 01:50:00,448
Started to GoFundMe and quickly raised over $130,000 for Hopkins

2375
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,080
Even though he's clearly making s*** up to be used as a basis for right-wing dictatorship enabling propaganda

2376
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,616
Of course Veritas

2377
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:11,200
Can claim that he was coerced into recanting his story and he said that he

2378
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
He didn't

2379
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,016
This could just be another one of those

2380
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320
Things that's totally believe by the Dum Dum

2381
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
But there's no real evidence

2382
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,928
Only acting in ways

2383
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:25,280
Exactly what you would do if you want to keep a grip going but also want to cover your ass

2384
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,304
Prime leaf

2385
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
Exposure

2386
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:29,632
Sad stuff all around

2387
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,912
Can you come on in here I

2388
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,192
Just want to talk to you about the

2389
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
Voter fraud in the alleged abuse that

2390
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:40,384
Why didn't you say s*** is because you could be hit with a federal crime for like to I'd like to

2391
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,784
We can't avoid

2392
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,088
Flash forward to a little later

2393
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:54,464
I didn't work and everything remember recanting anything--but give me my GoFundMe money no kid

2394
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,536
I would not be surprised if that's a GoFundMe get

2395
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
It's frozen

2396
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,864
Anyway Steve Channel comes in

2397
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,400
And he's there too

2398
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,424
Complain about

2399
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,192
John

2400
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
Brennan

2401
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,496
What do you want

2402
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,224
It was one of the stupidest

2403
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,504
He's ever done

2404
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,832
Did he claim that the election was a thing

2405
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:27,488
I would feel real stupid if I gave an interview where I said that

2406
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,536
I didn't say that

2407
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,584
Brandon was talking about how like

2408
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,376
You got to get Trump out of there like

2409
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,728
He's a caged lion

2410
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,776
You don't know what he's going to do during

2411
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,312
Lame duck.

2412
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:43,872
So he was just sort of

2413
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,408
Close to anything

2414
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,688
That Alex says

2415
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,456
That is

2416
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:54,624
Encouraging the 25th Amendment review

2417
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,256
No elaborate conspiracy

2418
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,280
Trump into

2419
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Getting hit

2420
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:05,120
With the 25th Amendment

2421
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
Public television

2422
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
Hey

2423
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,008
Tops f****** dude earned

2424
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,288
He's f***** up there

2425
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:18,432
Hey guys I don't know if you've been alive for the past four years or if you have ever read any history but

2426
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:24,064
You realize that wannabe dictator is don't leave on their own accord right now to leave the room at

2427
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,880
Themes

2428
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,440
Even assuming

2429
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,744
Everything goes fine in January

2430
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,536
Like there's a lot of damage

2431
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,632
He's got it I'm not saying that I'm a hundred percent

2432
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
Agree with that just

2433
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,680
Based on like

2434
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,984
How much more trouble that cost

2435
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,288
And the fact that January is

2436
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,824
Coming

2437
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,104
I understand

2438
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
Brandon

2439
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,664
Perspectives like

2440
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,432
I don't know

2441
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:54,016
Anyway Steve somebody who Alex says has been in the CIA

2442
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,808
Steve Wood back today

2443
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:00,416
I was accused of being a shill for the CIA

2444
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Accused by who

2445
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:07,072
Maybe an important party and David Knight

2446
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,632
Alex's said many many times

2447
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:11,680
It seems in the CIA

2448
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,448
Stop.

2449
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,288
If I were Alex and I were interviewing him I'd be like what you've told me that you were

2450
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:19,104
A lot for years

2451
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,944
Steve was on the war room with Owen on the fair

2452
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:28,064
And he said that the whole election was a staying they water is balanced yes

2453
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:34,464
And it's all like haha They played into our hands to claim and would later discover was

2454
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,744
Was completely false dumb

2455
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,512
Information

2456
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
It would haunt

2457
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,840
You for the rest of your career and you would never be able to get a job

2458
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:43,168
Atlanta lone be some sort of presenter on the show

2459
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,704
Again so soon

2460
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,568
Is this technique called hand-waving

2461
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,896
Trump is very much in control

2462
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,688
This is what I said

2463
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,224
Before this is Sun Tzu

2464
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,272
He's watching the game

2465
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,808
Manipulating

2466
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:05,696
Tony we set it up

2467
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:12,096
It is not relevant

2468
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:18,496
It's not really important

2469
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:24,896
Minor detail

2470
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:28,224
Election was a setup operation minor detail

2471
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,760
Minor detail

2472
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,040
Whatever

2473
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:31,808
Bucking

2474
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,600
What a dick pretty amazing

2475
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:38,208
That's unfair to Steve has a belief that Trump is going to win the electoral college

2476
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,768
What sure

2477
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:44,352
What I said years ago on your show

2478
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:48,448
We did a sting operation on Hillary Clinton she didn't say

2479
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,216
Exceed

2480
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,752
We are allowing buying to

2481
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
To be president

2482
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,568
446

2483
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
And it's over

2484
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,872
What

2485
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,896
It will be over

2486
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:57,920
The electric

2487
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,688
College will be

2488
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:05,088
Planet Trump want Rumple come back

2489
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:09,440
Looters

2490
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
Well

2491
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,304
Cheese's

2492
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:20,960
We got a pretty solid prediction there we connect on that about a month

2493
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,752
Sorry about that

2494
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,056
I do like that I think they're very kind

2495
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,872
I think that's like is that their version of a Make-a-Wish like

2496
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:34,272
We're going to let it be president of 40 to 60 days and then obviously we're going to do a coup in

2497
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,832
But he's going to have a really good night

2498
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:43,488
He's making some specific predictions and also handle nonsense that he said

2499
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,512
About the watermark

2500
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,304
Text to Heidi ritza minority

2501
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,352
I will say that this makes

2502
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,912
I've never agreed with him more

2503
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,848
Totally agree

2504
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:05,248
Totally 100% agree there is no reason for anyone to believe you

2505
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,552
Reasons for the opposite

2506
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,368
I would say that didn't fit in the procon call them you got

2507
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,392
0 Bros

2508
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,184
So this interview end

2509
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
Pretty uneventful

2510
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,024
Which I was kind of disappointed by

2511
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,560
And

2512
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,840
I feel very

2513
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,376
Confused

2514
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
Betrayed

2515
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,960
Flummoxed yeah

2516
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,984
Animal with more words

2517
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,520
If you like but I don't have

2518
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,336
Mysore is Handy maybe that's a more fitting pun

2519
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,896
Steve is to take away his

2520
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:33,920
Dick's Wings

2521
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:37,504
Well I mean this is a pretty small swing except for him

2522
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
I'm saying that

2523
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
If you know like

2524
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:45,440
We are allowing by U2

2525
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,256
Boring middle of Infowars

2526
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,560
And I got kind of excited when this happen

2527
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,376
See we really appreciate you thinking for all the time

2528
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,680
Thank you and God bless

2529
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472

2531
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,032
Call Cindy

2532
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,568
Come back I got one more question

2533
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,848
Important phone calls

2534
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,200
Cuz everybody's talking about

2535
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:10,528
Election fraud watermarks I know those existed Secret Service

2536
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,552
30 years ago

2537
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
Printer ink

2538
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,392
I don't know all that stuff that's a real thing I'm going to get your take on that

2539
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,672
Fred Hamilton County

2540
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,720
He does not bottom of the ninth

2541
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,744
Two outs

2542
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:24,096
Is Steve pieczenik going to get one more chance to swing the bat dad

2543
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:29,728
He does not know damn it I thought he had one big Swig left it doesn't even really ask the question

2544
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,752
Turn directly at all

2545
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:36,128
Just want to talk about how great it is the Trump's firing people even though he just lost shipping

And bring it all these war heroes right

2549
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,344
Can I see the pucker Factor

2550
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,392
Visibly scared

2551
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,696
I got videos of them learning the Trump winning States

2552
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,976
Custom iron

2553
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
Panicking

2554
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:54,560
Country

2555
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,632
Watch for military doing

2556
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,448
Military

2557
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,896

01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
What year did bloodhound

2560
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,040
I mean you're Sherlock Holmes in that way I don't need it

2561
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:20,928
Facetiously holyshit

2562
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,952
No this is

2563
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,232
I will.

2564
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,256
Guarantee

2565
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,048
My career my future

2566
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,376
Trump will be the next president of the United States

2567
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
8 years

2568
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,472
Not only four years it will be eight

2569
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,264
Alright dude

2570
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,288
Alright

2571
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:42,688
He hit a line drive single guaranteed

2572
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,968
On his career

2573
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,784
Trample serpent

2574
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,552
8 years

2575
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:48,576
Correct

2576
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
Cool

2577
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:50,880
Alright

2578
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:57,280
Well I'm not a fan of authoritarianism but I do have a guest on who saying that Trump is going to destroy term limits

2579
01:58:57,536 --> 01:59:00,096
I just want you guys to know and I've lost

2580
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
This election

2581
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
Or something

2582
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:06,240
This brings us to the end of our episode and

2583
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,288
Things up on Monday with what happened

2584
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,312
The evening

2585
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,592
I know

2586
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,152
I got to know we'll find out what happened in

2587
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,968
South Carolina

2588
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,016
I guess North Carolina after that

2589
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,088
Virginia need somebody

2590
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,368
Like this is me

2591
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:27,488
To be documented 24 hours because we've already seen so many stupid things that you know

2592
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,280
Very interesting

2593
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,864
Angry conversation I almost guarantee

2594
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,424
I bet it was incredibly boring

2595
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:39,008
Really there's no way that they were like oh we can't do this

2596
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:45,408
We can't do this rally here and they got them they had a furious argument together though I'm sure own be like okay sir and then

2597
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,992
I would bet if you wired their car

2598
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,784
And like you had the actual footage

2599
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:55,392
It would just be hours of them singing 99 bottles of beer on the wall

2600
01:59:55,904 --> 02:00:00,512
Alright who else has a shell called Joker and Paul's Twitter

2601
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,048
Do

2602
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,912
No one can get in this bus

2603
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:07,680
Downtown

2604
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,448
World

2605
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,336
That guy was another bus he was along with the other end

2606
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,360
But

2607
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:19,456
Yeah cuz I do think there's a tiny bit of

2608
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,480
If you look

2609
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,272
Do you like Tallahassee

2610
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,600
Turn out it was definitely better

2611
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,624
Yeah

2612
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,672
But I think they do better at night

2613
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,488
Also so I think

2614
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:35,584
Lesson from that building

2615
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,864
I'm excited

2616
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,192
See like if it keeps growing a little bit I will I hope it doesn't

2617
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:45,056
That could be a half done too many tours where it's like

2618
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,080
You have a

2619
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:51,712
Couple first bad shows and then your third show you're like oh s*** there's 70 people there this good turnout

2620
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:54,272
Everybody was great we parted afterwards

2621
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:58,112
This whole thing is turning around and then your next show there's two people

2622
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
In Finland

2623
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,928
Send Dan Midland

2624
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:04,512
They were from Finland how am I supposed to do skinny jokes to two people for

2625
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,584
Define common

2626
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:13,472
It wasn't good I don't know I'm interested to see I would like to I'd like to

2627
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:20,128
I don't know what I would like to end without any violence

2628
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
Particularly invest

2629
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,968
Like if this story ends up in his being a

2630
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,760
Complete dud Adam like

2631
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:27,296
Embarrassing awful

2632
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:32,672
That'll be pretty f***** up growing and growing to the point where they get to

2633
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,208
There's a lot of people

2634
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,256
Hey it's still just as a rally

2635
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:40,864
That's fine story story short

2636
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,632
They did

2637
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,656
Couple people in Oz

2638
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:47,264
Almost almost make me believe that Owens speeches did inspire people

2639
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,104
Certainly not very much maybe other people social media post

2640
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,688
But I I you know I could see that as a story and I'd be fine with that too

2641
02:01:54,944 --> 02:02:00,064
Keeper shooting some people is not the story that I want to see as long as we can avoid that

2642
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:01,600
I think we can have a lot of fun

2643
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
The Danza

2644
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,928
Cara vanity project

2645
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,208
Fairy Tail ending

2646
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,744
Fairy Tail ending

2647
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,512
Alright

2648
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:12,096
We have every policy wonk and DC show up

2649
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,168
And Surround their rally

2650
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,960
All of them holding their phones

2651
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:20,032
And when the rally is sad and everybody

2652
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,312
Kind of slinks away they also

2653
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:23,616
Simultaneously press the button on their phone

2654
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,920
And 200 phone scream out

2655
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,944
Wow

2656
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:32,320
Just like that that's what I want at all play I'm Apollo

2657
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,624
Do do

2658
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:40,256
Yes I will see what happens I'm thrilled that we were able to do this because

2659
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,792
This this could not wait

2660
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:45,376
Is just too much material for one episode

2661
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:51,264
Leave it all for

2662
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,664
Maybe we wouldn't have gotten that weird appearance from here on there

2663
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:02,528
Unfair that that's how you can operate in the real world

2664
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,552
But

2665
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,576
We will be back

2666
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,344
