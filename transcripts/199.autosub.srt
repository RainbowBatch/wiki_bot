1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,128
Alex Jones

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,248
I don't know probably

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
I don't know

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,600
Dumbest thing I've ever done I've got a lot of dumb stuff

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Jumped off roof

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Before I fall

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
Yeah where are we playing never have I ever right now

9
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:40,960
3 hour version of Never Have I Ever

10
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,896
Because I have been all day.

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Adjust note

12
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Just about all the dump

13
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
Bulshit

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
What the f*** are you idiots doing

15
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,912
How was your day you didn't even count for like the ice people who are loving all of this s*** they don't realize

16
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,728
But everything is f***** over them

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,288
Stupid they're so f****** stupid

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,896
I got to get off the internet forever I can't read anymore take

19
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
Not as hot as people think they are

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,208
Caribou on Alex Jones.

21
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Let school out with that criticism

22
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Etc

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Analyze the fun

24
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
You are

25
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Effervescent

26
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
Turn it up bad headache

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,368
Episode.

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,464
Effect on me

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
Incredibly difficult to listen to Alex Jones anymore

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
It's too hard to recognize little pieces that are very familiar

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Much less pain

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
To listen to Alex Jones

33
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Steak

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Viola

35
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
It's the same stuff that we were

36
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Recovering before but

37
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
There's just a reality

38
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
Riggs

39
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Medium

40
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,200
You don't like any of those dude out on comedy

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Screaming about things

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
To take a moment

43
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Far out

44
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,608
Because we're a little over 200 episodes into the podcast

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Forgot

46
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,872
Numbering episodes is not really our strong suit or anything like that but I recognize that you know

47
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,248
Radar logo had as our logo on iTunes

48
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
And I was great but

49
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Now that we're

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
About the little over 2

51
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
After we got a new logo I want to see you very special thank you to a Catherine for designing

52
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
If you want to enjoy it

53
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
Fallout 4

54
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
This far and take YouTube

55
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
For the one we're going to be absolutely.

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
Wind blowing

57
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
I don't know I was going to try and maybe quotes

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,095
I dug into my bag of 20 in there I don't know

59
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Maybe I saw could have been in there

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,639
You're lucky I even say Walt Whitman

61
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Cuz I was close

62
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Shakespeare

63
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Alex

64
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Jojo

65
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207

66
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231

I'm a policy wonk

69
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
In a very weird turn of events I think we have multiple people named Dakota donating to the show which I think is great

70
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,943
I don't know the only Dakota I know is

71
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
South

72
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,327
Also would like to give a shout out

73
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
We really appreciate

74
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:31,263
I believe that this is a pseudonym becoming a technocrat alphabets

75
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
Someone someone sodomizing a poop

76
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
Google

77
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
I don't want to

78
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,631
Thank you so much alphabet

79
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,263
Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow

80
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Chris Martin

81
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591

82
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,687
You got together with Gwyneth Paltrow

83
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
It's something that happens on the weekends

84
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Or it could be

85
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Tim Cook

86
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319

89
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
They have

90
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,255
I love baby the alphabet is Google

91
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
Pilot inspector it's not

92
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
Alphabet flight creating an alphabet soup

93
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Exactly

94
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,431
We're going to be doing

95
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
The week was incredibly emotional

96
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
Feel up to doing episode so sorry we missed that folks

97
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815

00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,239
Lights

100
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
I looked at the episodes

101
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
There's something I want

102
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
Anders Breivik

103
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
Going to be

104
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
I think she weaves into it

105
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Fingers crossed

106
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,447
But it was checking out Jim Bakker

107
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239

00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Effervesce

111
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247

112
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
And I checked out

113
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807

Zion

117
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
On Thursday

118
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
His lawyers had a demotion

119
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Which was denied

120
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Forward

121
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
His argument that is just as free speech

122
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
I was

123
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
So that's that

124
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
Look stairs like stare directly designs

125
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Fake laugh at him

126
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
That would be

127
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah I'm not sure so enjoy with us today we're recording missing like

128
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815

132
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Spoiler alert

133
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
Lot

134
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Oklahoma City stuff

135
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Finish my research I really don't want to do the turnaround

136
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
Monday Monday

137
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,079
Officially ruined everybody's

138
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
It's pretty interesting on a number of levels

139
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
The upsetting

140
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Now let's start with an avocado

141
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Text Rob from today's office

142
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
Undelay undelay undelay undelay

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Petco

144
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,871
Set the man on Mark that off his the first impression of

145
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,711
A shower

146
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,551
Yeah I think so

147
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
I love the confidence

148
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
What is that what is that

149
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255

150
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,655
What are who am I

151
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727
You're getting ahead of yourself there might be some esoteria

152
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Episode

153
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,871
Starting today's episode off

154
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
Envy

155
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
Starts every episode nowadays

156
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
She's getting

157
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Real grandiose about them

158
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
16 days

159
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Megatel

160
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
Most important election in world history

161
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,351
Planet is at a Crossroads

162
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Destination down

163
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
We are struggling

164
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
Hours of operation

165
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Ladies and gentlemen

166
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
So we have the theme that developed the most important election of all time

167
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
And then of course the same thing that he has to do all the time

168
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Lister

169
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
Is that thing that he

170
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
Constantly uses which is like it's basically a tie ballgame

171
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,799
It's basically tybalt's

172
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,407
323 of course even though it is tied we have been destroying them the entire game

173
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Everybody knows

174
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Make perfect

175
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Get more money out of people

176
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
When you have this world

177
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
That's all pretty sensible

178
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
I think that's exactly where he needs

179
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
To be from his business model

180
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Broke

181
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
Restarting the show

182
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
Happens at the 20-minute point of the episode

183
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
He's 20 minutes late

184
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
For the show

185
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
Probably maybe he was in court on that dick.

186
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
They just play like report Special Report

187
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
Weird techno music with Alex's drops over it talkin about

188
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
FedEx

189
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Recalled

190
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
The Techno music with us.

191
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
20 minutes late

192
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
Tells you to the most important election ever

193
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Tie ballgame

194
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
How many plays

195
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Tucker Carlson

196
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Tucker's

197
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
A former Clinton strata

198
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,343
Who idea of online censorship

199
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Stuff like that

200
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Listening to Tucker Carlson I think you suck

201
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
He's a douche I don't care

202
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
This is Alex Jones

203
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Specifically not what about Tucker Carlson

204
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,543
Kind of worried about his grasp issues

205
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Okay

206
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,551
The First Amendment

207
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,903
Free speech is an internet right

208
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
I can't say anyone

209
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
I would say any sleeping in

210
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
There already are rules about discluding people based on race or

211
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,967
Trend or anything like that

212
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Do conservatives think they're erase

213
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
I think it's absolutely

214
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
It's not even

215
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
We can't play the game on their turn

216
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
Cuz they are describing

217
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
Conservatives are getting kicked off

218
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Not just even.

219
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Consequences of their actions

220
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Come home to roost

221
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
It's a situation where people who are dangerous ideas out into the world

222
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
Violating

223
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
It's not

224
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Not conservative

225
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Again

226
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Problem that I keep bringing up his

227
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
When you have these rules

228
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Good to have these rules

229
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
But you can never enforce them

230
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Appropriate

231
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,631
What's the name of the what's the name of the Underground

232
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
The morlocks the morlocks

233
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Make sure that there's a pejorative term

234
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
I think they would get a real charge out of

235
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
It's enough

236
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Understand anything that's a good point

237
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,463
Tucker doesn't understand what he's bringing up black people on it

238
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Absolutely

239
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,279
Regulation

240
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Libertarian

241
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
There was only one

242
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Right

243
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,543
Whenever you regulate anything that then make them

244
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,943
Regulations are important when it's you who feels bad and they're not important

245
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,063
Buddy else feels bad what was the road

246
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
To Facebook

247
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
I suppose

248
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Is already

249
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Taken care of

250
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
No blacks

251
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
They couldn't say that

252
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
That would not fly

253
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
I wouldn't know

254
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
No no

255
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
It would be tough

256
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Dummy accounts and whatnot

257
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
It's not okay

258
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
Analogy

259
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
Absolutely

260
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Have to do that

261
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
To turn

262
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
That that like

263
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
No no no how dare you say that just because we lie and threaten people with physical

264
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,591
We're not racism to say that you can't harass women

265
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Racist against me

266
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Norwalk

267
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Yeah it's it's

268
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
It's a tough rhetorical hurdle

269
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,231
I think you're in a bubble like Fox News or out

270
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
The show

271
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Willie easy-to-make like

272
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
That sort of

273
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Wiggle

274
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
Wiggle like

275
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
Know anybody who was

276
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
Ridiculous conversation

277
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
I don't know

278
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
We're outside

279
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
My friend

280
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Absolutely the best

281
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
In the business

282
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
At this

283
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
He's pretty good at that too

284
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Demonizing

285
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Humanizing his opponents

286
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Enemies

287
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
Which is pretty great.

288
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Here

289
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Sociopathic

290
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
Hateful dishonorable

291
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Dishonest

292
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Truly Wicked people

293
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
And just viciously

294
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,591
And run your life

295
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
Destroy the family

296
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Take everything away from you

297
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
Virtual reality with a conceal yourself

298
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
They are completely turned over to

299
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
What's wrong

300
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
It's real

301
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Okay

302
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
I can't

303
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
No has a real-world core

304
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
He thinks are great

305
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,991
No corollaries two things that the people he says are doing these things

306
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
Every single f******

307
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Everywhere everywhere

308
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,791
Grind all of the things that they are and buy his own at definition

309
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
We should be f****** killing them

310
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Is everybody should murder him

311
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,735
Qualifies as a murder where the offense and

312
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
His book then

313
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
More importantly

314
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
This is what you're responding to

315
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
Whether he means to or not this is a lot of projects

316
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
This is a lot of

317
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Even throughout the show

318
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Arcade

319
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Destroy you and they're trying to kill your family you know like if they were too I don't know

320
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
Remove

321
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
You know like maybe they were trying to make it harder to get into colleges only make it more easy to commit sexual assault

322
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Policy directive

323
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,639
His entire cabinet everybody's working towards Iris

324
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
But I just

325
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
He wouldn't even wrestle with that

326
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Humanizing

327
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
You don't making it so it is okay to attack them

328
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
This works hand-in-hand with his narrative about

329
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
How the media is going to fall flag themselves Democrats

330
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
To get pity and sympathy in front of the midterm

331
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,983
Blame It On The Rain

332
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,871
If something bad does happen

333
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,199
Who wanted to throw your family and then eventually

334
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,343
So if one of them were dangerous and one of them

335
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
Some sort of

336
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
News organization

337
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
You know you may be the president

338
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Quotes the president in French

339
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
Nobody would listen to the president

340
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,943
Silly

341
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
Right

342
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
We talked about

343
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
Like repeatedly so we don't

344
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
I don't think we should spend half an hour

345
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Is Uber

346
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Supertanker

347
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
Doing it and we're not doing it to them

348
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,448
We're not demonize ultra-humanite these people

349
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,312
Literally doing everything that he said to make you guys demonize us

350
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
Supposed over liberal use of the term Nazi

351
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
To describe people

352
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
I think we've been through dishes

353
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Calling people who are

354
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Expressing ideas

355
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,232
Calling them not to

356
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Stephen Fry

357
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Declaration

358
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
But

359
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
You know I'm slowly

360
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
You're coming over to my

361
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
We'll see about that

362
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
You could call Summer

363
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Nazi

364
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Is only getting larger

365
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
All the people who shouldn't have called before like

366
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,368
You know what Lindsey Graham is a terrible human being who is trying to kill everybody

367
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
I know you're like

368
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,376
Yeah I mean I guess it comes down to that

369
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Kind of the right hand

370
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Seamless

371
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Turn towards

372
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Abuse

373
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Dehumanization

374
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Outdoor unlike yourself

375
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,224
The ratcheting up of the temperature of the water

376
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
And instead of getting boiled they're all just

377
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Becoming okay

378
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
With us

379
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Very very close to

380
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Fascista Jason

381
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
Alex gets into

382
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
In a weird way and I think he's in a very strange mood

383
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
He might have done mushrooms the night before this episode

384
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,952
He's he's real weird on this episode from this boy.

385
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
Not far off start talking about the Comets of proof

386
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
It's very scary

387
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Probably going to hit the world you have your finger on the pulse

388
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
All right Siri

389
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
World government use now here in your face

390
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:54,880
Mark

391
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Marquez and Marquez and

392
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
2000 years later

393
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Coming true no one can deny it

394
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Prophecy is being fulfilled

395
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Cool

396
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,544
It also says the church will fly tonight

397
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,384
Most people will accept the mark of the beast because they'll believe

398
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
Because the church is our churches

399
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
Federalize

400
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Communion ad

401
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
Mark my words

402
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
Sure

403
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
Also I like how you said

404
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
This my friend is what we call a setup

405
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:04,512
Because of course the production staff Googles

406
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
Conveniently there's a very similar headline that uses those words

407
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:15,008
Did Alex clearly read the headline read the story about this

408
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Something weird blog

409
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,200
And it's just someone who

410
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Can use biometrics

411
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Greece safety

412
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
I am the entire article what it's about is the idea of using fingerprints

413
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Kids Safe

414
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Churches

415
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
Like in terms of like knowing where they're going

416
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,328
And, make sure it's the right avoiding all members of

417
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
The clergy

418
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
I don't think

419
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
But I don't think that's

420
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
I don't know which fingerprinting is going to do to help that situation

421
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
Look I would say is

422
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Zurn

423
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Because I'm not a part of it

424
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't know

425
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,488
That putting this out as a suggestion of Waze

426
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Kris security

427
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:14,144
Plantable

428
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
Not a slippery slope thing that's going to lead to that

429
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
It's a

430
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
Safety measure

431
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,272
His idea is that in two years churches are going to

432
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Biomat

433
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Scan

434
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Yep to prove or to tie

435
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
You you do that but I was like is there a database of people who are in accordance with communion rules

436
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Believe me

437
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,728
You cannot be in a fight with any member of your family

438
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,056
You must also be right with God there

439
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
Proceed

440
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,480
The track is it going

441
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Your finger it'll go

442
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Which of course the man is very interested in catalog

443
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
Bring as well to let you know to let them know if you are right with God.

444
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
The government is going to implement the system where you fight with your family you must report it

445
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,200
He's got a login no

446
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,600
I know your password is the tetragrammaton

447
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
Pronounceable name

448
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,256
Special keyboard

449
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
So Alex's

450
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
You talk about the church is not being

451
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
The real churches and have a gun

452
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
We're going to need biometric

453
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,360
Kickstands

454
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Italy

455
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,584
How did enjoy that oh my God

456
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
Create the hologram

457
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Overhead

458
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
So it looked like he was a hologram

459
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,104
But he was still a lot he was he's still alive but his real body

460
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
When you go to do the holiday

461
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Got to get out there

462
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
Is that he's talking about like

463
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,464
The idea that in the Bible it says that

464
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Projected into

465
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,584
Giant Holograms

466
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
If you don't

467
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Weird

468
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,568
And if you don't submit well you'll be done

469
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
You don't do much

470
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,528
She's talking about the idea of the idea of like Chinese social score system

471
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Implemented in the United

472
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,488
Answer

473
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,840
Beginning to hard but then about a black mirror episode

474
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Yep yep

475
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:31,776
And more and more than very few will have five stars it'll be totally coveted the new Hollywood power

476
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,896
L will have five stars, like people

477
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Worship

478
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Sounds fun

479
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
Oh you want that five star don't you

480
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
Ali cut off of the entertainment jobs everything

481
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,960
Thousand

482
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
Information

483
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
World government

484
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Once you all get rid of this is going to start

485
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
Cool cool man world government

486
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,232
For now you can still go to infowars.com

487
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Videos

488
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Yeah probably

489
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Alex is not actually talking about the actual text from Ezekiel

490
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:15,968
You clearly talking about the 1974 book that written by

491
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Joseph Blum rich

492
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
Which was inspired by bloomridge reading Erich von daniken

493
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
Not the Bible verses that the foundation

494
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,072
Ezekiel Saw aliens

495
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
Alex leaves

496
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,192
Alright so let's say

497
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
Einstein

498
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,568
I'm saying that but for the sake of argument let's say it's not

499
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
What time what if I reference

500
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,200
What time

501
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Cool man

502
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Enjoyed

503
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,088
That's Project Camelot

504
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
That's insane

505
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,464
Baker Hughes

506
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
At Justice

507
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Exegesis of

508
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,912
The text that you take context clues from other parts in the Bible like

509
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Clear that it's

510
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
At least partially metaphorical

511
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
And then also

512
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
They talking about angel

513
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,224
It's not some sort of spacecraft and the blue helmet part that he's talking about is this awesome thing that people have

514
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Extrapolate

515
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:27,136
Blue Hound

516
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
Crazy nonsense

517
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
I love it

518
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
Car quotes

519
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,864
Sufficiently Advanced blue hat is indistinguishable from Angel

520
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
Dip

521
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
Alex believing you

522
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Zuppardo's

523
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,432
Centuries-old prophecy Ezekiel misinterpretations

524
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,552
It's just gorgeous like a good spaghetti sauce

525
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
If you're if you're watching

526
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
They would describe that as a

527
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
B

528
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,376
We're not going to talk about this tonight go off on a

529
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Bucking Ranch

530
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Because I know you have a lot of feelings about it

531
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Alex's

532
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
Less than gracious about John McCain

533
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
I'm not going to go on

534
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
There's no reason

535
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
To defy him

536
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Now that he's dead

537
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
But at the same time

538
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
No reason

539
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
I think especially for

540
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
Put out

541
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Some sort of negativity in the world be like

542
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Alex tries to play the card of I don't want to talk ill of the dead and I'd like to remind everyone how's the day after David Rock

543
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:51,360
Rockefeller died

544
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
The Rockefellers dad

545
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,504
Keep On Rockin in the Free World

546
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
He might've play ding dong the witch is dead

547
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,696
Quite frankly I would not have I don't remember that

548
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
So he's like

549
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
You know I don't like to speak ill of the dead but this guy with a f****** dick

550
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
And then he gets to this

551
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Send

552
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
But I think it's very interesting

553
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Longtime listeners of our

554
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Gyros

555
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Very familiar

556
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
I know it's last name isn't

557
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
Capone

558
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Hit on

559
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:37,184
I like take everyone back to 2015 when Alex Jones said about

560
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
You got a name like Corleone they arrest you

561
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
You got a name like Trump they don't

562
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:51,776
He's a front man for Consortium on the East Coast

563
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
Trump not a 4.3 years ago

564
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
You got a name like Capone

565
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
McClain's about her name

566
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Yeah I know

567
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
Sure put so much CO2

568
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
At least he's reusing some of his CO2

569
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
Except very hard

570
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:25,056
I've dealt with all of my complex emotions regarding John McCain

571
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,128
And I've decided that the best way

572
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
To express them

573
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
Is to pretend he's John Glenn

574
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
And just

575
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Confuse everyone

576
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,624
Okay I just was amazing

577
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
When he

578
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
Was the

579
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Went into space for the

580
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Changed my

581
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
I realize what was possible

582
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Because that man

583
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Did something that no one else

584
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
Average better as you can

585
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,752
Conflate

586
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
On the 1st

587
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Spacewalk

588
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,832
Incredible True Grit

589
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,792
I don't know I don't know how to setup Klipsch anymore like because

590
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
Because of anything that's wrong with me

591
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Because

592
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
This show is so stupid

593
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Like I don't

594
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Not our show put like

595
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
When I was real

596
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
To some extent we Elevate The Source material attached to the show I can't tell you how

597
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
How many times am I

598
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,088
This show sucks

599
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,672
Weirdo started writing your notes

600
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
In your own s*** on the wall

601
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
I don't understand what his plan is anymore other than

602
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
I'll look on the wall and see what I got

603
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,944
We heard him

604
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Using a

605
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Apple stores

606
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
To claim things about the Book of Ezekiel

607
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
Smart aleck

608
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Call me up

609
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
How are you

610
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
Continually

611
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Fox News

612
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
He knows how things work

613
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
I'll leave it at that

614
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
What is that I want to be the only one

615
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
Oh

616
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Poor guy

617
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Talk to me so smart so is the Pentagon

618
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Just calling

619
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,696
Yeah the actual building

620
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,304
Platonic ideal of the shape is calling out

621
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,632
That is actually like the level of heady

622
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,424
He's going to get in a little bit

623
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,824
You might not be so surprised the other day was really

624
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Close

625
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
It's real close

626
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,736
I reached into my pipe Neil glandon I discovered the truth

627
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
I would consider most of

628
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
They just kind of like we're just sort of

629
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Trading gold

630
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Material

631
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
But like

632
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
We're having

633
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
He does getting to like

634
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,120
Our favorite date of Alex Jones a little bit be just like

635
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:07,264
What are you talkin about man I think you figure used coat here but you are just freaking out on air

636
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
Just so that's what Eric nonsense

637
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
It starts on this next

638
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
Like its main let's call it the varsity narrative

639
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,392
Has been apologizing Watson put out an article with the headline

640
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,072
Is a massive scam for the midterm

641
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,704
Lower the headliner

642
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
We get them to the article about it a little yet

643
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Like the exact same nonsense

644
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
Facebook is run by the globalist

645
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
Like alright man

646
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
You're not evolving

647
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
He gets back

648
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
He starts the 2nd hour

649
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
To get to this

650
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Big news

651
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
The entire first hour

652
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
He gets the beginning of the second hour

653
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
And my man

654
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
It's time to get serious

655
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
Pulling up Bob

656
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
I don't really know how to

657
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Putting her sad

658
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,248
Why do people think virtual reality

659
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Blah blah

660
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:26,624
Play some outside force

661
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
Simulation

662
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Different

663
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
Telescopes

664
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
You name it

665
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,800
Power source

666
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,408
This universe together

667
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
It's just that

668
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,392
He goes into plug-in he's having a boring life

669
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Goodwill

670
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Is he crazy or hair

671
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
You don't know

672
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,784
I promise you he doesn't get to the point

673
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
The simulation that

674
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,216
What is your point never brings home never ties the bow of these thoughts

675
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
What is that

676
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:57,759
What does it mean it like even the

677
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,135
What the scientists have said it for a long time

678
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,535
This whole there's a greater energy or whatever that's holding the universe together

679
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
That 400

680
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
But now

681
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,471
Bankers m

682
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,871
Yeah crazy maybe they don't probably

683
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,295
They're all magically field according to Alex

684
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
Sunrise radio

685
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Also I just

686
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:39,487
There's a lot there's a lot going on there and I love the idea of Alex

687
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,583
Movies that are based on Philip K Dick's short stories and pretending they're real

688
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,911
Like I would love it if a week from now he shows up with a little

689
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Secret doors

690
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
I mean

691
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,271
I've been to drug

692
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
You should diversify

693
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Let's start

694
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,927
Let's just start spamming him with other science fiction writers

695
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Village restaurants

696
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
No but you gotta understand like he's only been a few movies

697
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
Then you have Waking Life which is also directed by Richard linklater and at the end

698
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
Linklater appears in the movie

699
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Vet references

700
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:39,135
Is the book by Philip

701
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
All of Alex's cinematic life

702
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Contingent on Richard linklater

703
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
Who's a huge fan

704
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
His work

705
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,375
Alex is never leaving the pkp

706
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Foundation

707
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,519
Alright

708
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
Amazon just green-lighted the foundation

709
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,063
Series references in here to

710
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,855
3 of May

711
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
High castle

712
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
YouTube

713
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
Like 20 seconds into every Spotify.

714
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Himself

715
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
He could exist in that world

716
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
I really like that show

717
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
I think

718
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Okay

719
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,943
I'm projecting onto the world that no one likes

720
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,759
Yeah that could be

721
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
I think most people are like

722
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
You know there's a speak

723
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:47,999
TV shows like I got to choose I got to go

724
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Series that way

725
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:54,911
Was based on Gillian Flynn's novel Gillian Flynn

726
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
Okay

727
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,079
Sapphire

728
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,711
This is boring but then there's a twist ending so you love it

729
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Goosebumps

730
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,879
So yep

731
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,695
Alex is going to get even weirder and here is

732
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
Little boys

733
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
Highway

734
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
Not even close to the depth

735
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
Spirit

736
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,519
With what

737
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
Broadcast

738
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Hell on Earth

739
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,911
That's what every other culture says

740
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
None of them are atheist

741
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
Play believe in

742
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Everything she did

743
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:16,575
Yep

744
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,391
How could you not

745
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
What we've seen going on

746
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
But 2001 Space Odyssey

747
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
Mark of the beast is here World governments here

748
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
You proved it in relation but it's not

749
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
Short but it's been proven it's all held together

750
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
I don't know what that was

751
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
Experience consciousness

752
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
And free will cuz your God

753
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
The one thing you don't have it something separate from you is conscious but its own little universe and it's mine and that's us

754
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,927
University

755
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
You got cut off by that break

756
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
But hot bulshit throughout most.

757
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Sit-in

758
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
First of all is like it's a simulation

759
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
Okay you're saying

760
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Gnostic

761
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
In terms of theme

762
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,015
God created us cuz he doesn't have any

763
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:23,391
Projection

764
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,511
I wish you could experience himself from external

765
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,607
More into it because I don't think Alex is ready Gnostic scriptures

766
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
Is I think

767
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Scott

768
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
Delta frequent

769
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,615
Copy of his 2001

770
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Really

771
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,991
He put out he was known primarily for the

772
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Dilbert

773
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Dog bark

774
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,343
Catbird

775
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,583
No there was a character who worked at

776
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
Reevaluate

777
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,191
Wall-E

778
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,335
I think that was a hero to a book in 2001

779
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Yeah

780
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
No

781
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
The phrasing

782
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,647
What's going on with 2001

783
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
So I reckon

784
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,511
When I was

785
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
16 or so

786
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
1817

787
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
I smoked a lot of weed

788
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
But the only thing God

789
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Could be interested in

790
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
Is experiencing a world without himself

791
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
Until God destroy himself

792
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,831
And we are the debris of God's Own destruction

793
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,415
What if he doesn't exist

794
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
Interconnect

795
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,511
Through the internet what have you and that's our way of trying to

796
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
To bring back

797
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
The wholeness of

798
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
What

799
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
We are

800
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Wrestler the CliffsNotes version of it

801
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
Pneumatic connections to what Alex has rambling about

802
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,591
I think he just read got to breathe at 6

803
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Mind-blowing

804
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,199
Do you know synesthesia moment

805
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
Listening to that whole thing

806
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
Smelled colors

807
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:37,023
Like a Simone biles floor routine

808
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,839
Broccoli

809
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
She's the greatest gymnast

810
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,263
Alex's clip with the surf Rock

811
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
Listening to him talk was just him like

812
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,199
Do it all these weird movement

813
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
And then

814
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
All of those

815
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,439
He said it was already in motion

816
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Hot mess

817
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
Bulshit

818
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,791
Looks amazing

819
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
It's only the beginning

820
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
Only the beginning of how weird

821
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,263
For you this is going to get

822
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
This next clip

823
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
From everything I understand

824
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
What is describing

825
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,415
Almost

826
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Hundreds and hundreds

827
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
That's impossible

828
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
Whole family peoples

829
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
Just goes on

830
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,751
Dairy Queen

831
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
God nothing

832
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,407
He's in Waking Life

833
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
I'm going to go back really quick

834
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Just because

835
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,463
Little fragments of things and whatever

836
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Later imagine

837
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
And then you have another dream within that but what if you dream that your multiples

838
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
Two people can dream and if they dream

839
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Lindo's

840
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
Two people can have two people's dreams

841
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,967
And all the dreams are happening all at once

842
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
You can't f******

843
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,807
What's the

844
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
Movie like Alex

845
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,303
I'm super into Transcendence.

846
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,167
You can have through like meditating or lucid dreaming I think there's a lot

847
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
In those

848
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
In those States

849
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Something

850
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
Something to be said for that but I do think it's

851
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
It's troubling whenever you're someone

852
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
Who's a

853
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,431
I don't know 45 year-old big drunk

854
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,551
This world

855
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
I don't I don't know about you anymore man

856
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:16,255
You did some shrooms man

857
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
But then it gets worse listen to this

858
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Crystal Vision

859
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Onelife rock song says

860
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
It's Fleetwood Mac

861
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:39,039
Think about that God is all-powerful God is all-encompassing time with an endless

862
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,879
We are independent creatures

863
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,207
Able to have free will or subvert our free will

864
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,511
The other

865
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Creatures that decided not

866
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,191
Does the hierarchy not to Ash and

867
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
The long arduous process

868
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,847
But did you decided to just try to rule their falling

869
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Position

870
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,199
What the f*** 2nd Dimension position

871
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
I do kind of know what he's talking

872
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
About it it's crazy nonsense

873
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
That's from like Illuminati message boards

874
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,999
It's not really all that worth getting into butt

875
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
Freewheelers

876
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:27,935
Where you ascribe is kind of also just to the other side

877
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,543
Boring the idea of like

878
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:38,943
Yes I am serving at a extraterrestrial entity of some sort but I'm free and doing so

879
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,271
These other people that I don't like her serving another entity

880
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Attract

881
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Like I just stopped

882
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:51,999
Yeah I think my only reaction

883
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Just like I

884
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
Doing right

885
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
What do you mean

886
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
What is anybody's

887
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Is going on here

888
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Alex

889
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
What are you doing right now

890
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:10,431
I'll tell you what he's doing is probably trying to prepare himself to go back on Rogan's show cuz apparently baby going back on

891
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Rogan show soon

892
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Great

893
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
I don't know

894
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,551
Decided there was a post that was put on Facebook

895
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
Of course

896
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
I didn't do any looking into this

897
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,535
There was an account that was supposedly Alex Jones

898
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,839
Confirm

899
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:36,031
Plausible

900
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
Really good chance Alex Jones

901
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
Profile

902
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
If you're going back

903
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,599
I'm about to do 3 hours

904
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
So that leads to this next

905
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Which is

906
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Man

907
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,375
I am not going to be good on this episode

908
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Because this

909
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,447
Text clip is about 3 1/2 minutes long

910
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,799
It's one of the most bizarre things I've ever heard him say in a long time

911
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Connote

912
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Completely

913
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
Blocked man

914
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
Who is

915
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
To deal with it

916
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
While doing a radio show

917
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
Interesting

918
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,487
Psychological study

919
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
Button

920
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Some places

921
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
That are like

922
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
This is about you Alex

923
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
You're wrestling with

924
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,519
He feels it though he feels it but

925
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
His entire life

926
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,687
Suppressing the way he feels about himself and then projecting it on other

927
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
Eric like this

928
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
Starts to creep out

929
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
A little bit

930
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
So

931
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Possibly

932
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
All the study show

933
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,631
This is hurting you is depressing you

934
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,471
It's destroying your

935
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,031
Sounds like what happened

936
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,527
And they were arrogant and try to spend wish I didn't try to turn it around again

937
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:34,815
The elected all the rest of them you shut up about the topics Alex Jones covered or we will

938
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Destroy you

939
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,143
We will tell elaborate lies

940
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,727
And frogs about you everyday come after your family

941
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
We will destroy you

942
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,615
If you don't submit to us without slavery

943
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,663
Real quick I'm just going to cut into

944
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
To say like there's so many people on the internet

945
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
Play the exact same stories

946
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Is that Alex does

947
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
There's so many people

948
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
The cover the exam

949
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
He's facing consequences

950
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
This is all about him

951
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
This is all about

952
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
That doesn't

953
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,103

Consumed

1004
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Rewritten

1005
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
Disease

1006
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Destroyed forever

1012
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,895
Wow I don't believe in Alex's dumb like

1013
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:43,551
They have to tell you what they're doing to you in order to do this kind of thing

1014
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,087
You're doing that exact

1015
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,695
Unparalleled

1016
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719

Hoverboard

1039
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,343
No one is stopping

1040
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,487
Your empathy would override the show

Genuinely

1046
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Believe the bulshit you're pedaling

1047
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,335
And even we can see how bad you're projecting right now and we got

1048
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
Some help

1049
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,199
You're not on YouTube little more free

1050
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,991
Just let your freak flag fly

1051
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,271
But

1052
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
This is being recorded

1053
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
So

1054
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Reel it in

1055
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
Admittedly Alex

1056
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,255
Really only damn freezing his list

1057
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
At least with a critical eye

1058
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:15,615
Feel whatever we want to feel about it

1059
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,967
But I will say

1060
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,015
Gives a real weird glitch

1061
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
In 2 hours

1062
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,135

People who like

Fly under our radar quite a bit

1094
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:50,239
People who are on 500 plus

1095
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543

Townhome values that is probably

1098
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
Controlling the universe and that's what God is you know

1099
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,487
People are generally scared

1100
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,559
Of people who hearken back to a Time

1101
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
And a place

1102
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375
When women were good-looking

1103
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,959
All the men are above average

1104
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,543
All the propaganda

1105
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,591
Angry

1106
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359

01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,431
The kid to figure out that Lake Wobegon

1120
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:16,767
A position of authority that he surrounds himself with women he doesn't

1121
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:22,143
Absolutely sexually harassed them 85% of the time or whatever it is come on

1122
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
That's crazy

1123
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,751
The world we would know

1124
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151

Going on with 2001 A Space Odyssey

1146
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
You all know

1147
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,599
Why do they make the whole ship out of the black box

1148
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:51,743
Words very close to that level of thinking on his part

1149
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Much more

1150
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
Problematic

1151
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,839
Weird

1152
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631

Yeah

1154
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Kind of

1155
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,751
In fact up

1156
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,775
To talk about certain

1160
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
The favorite

1161
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
You are kind of libertarian

1162
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,495
YouTube

1163
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,799

Criticize pedophilia in the Catholic Church

1167
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,623
Cephalization kids by any group heterosexual or homosexual

01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,231
I get called homophobic body Publications and show

1169
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,583

Lesbian

1173
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
So

1174
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,271
You just demonstrated

1175
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
You at the end

1176
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Sure

1177
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,671
What question

1178
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:30,815
Examples in the same set

1179
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,143
Yeah yeah

1180
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
Dim themselves

1181
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,263
It's so demonstrative

1182
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:45,919
Incredible Hulk like they always doing right now

1183
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
8 bananas

1184
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
That you know whenever I criticize

1185
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,415
Pedophile whoever they are

1186
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,095
I don't get why there's a problem here

1187
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
Because there's a Venn diagram situation going on

1188
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,799
When he talks about

1189
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,127
Pedophiles he's not always talking about the LG

1190
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Gbt commute

1191
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,199
If a woman

1192
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,807
He's pretty much always weaving in pedophilia to it tends to

1193
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,207
As we've been doing the show there's so many times

1194
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Like exactly what

1195
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
He said that like must

1196
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,143
You mean that the community is run bad

1197
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
You don't like

1198
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,983
That is an unnecessary suffering to take

1199
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Edit

1200
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,311
Conclusion that he's coming to from innocent

1201
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
Coverage of

1202
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,127
It's because every

1203
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175
He's like

1204
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
He can't resist

1205
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,295
The urge to be like

1206
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
Do you like

1207
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,999
If you're just making valid criticisms of the Catholic Church

1208
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,607
Are all pretty much there now it's a long time

1209
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
It took a long time

1210
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,727
5200

1211
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:18,335
I don't know all of the church's existence for everybody to kind of be like

1212
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
And knows about it

1213
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
You shouldn't

1214
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,879
Just figure out where to put the. In the center

1215
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Alex

1216
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,207
Just wait just figure it out

1217
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:39,071
I'm a Libertarian and I think everybody should be able to do what they want to do

1218
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
.

1219
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
And then

1220
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
Skip the last part

1221
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,959
Is you being like

1222
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
Libertarian

1223
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,199
And he doesn't believe any of you like standard liberal

1224
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,599
I don't know what else to say other than what we've already said

1225
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,927
Like people

1226
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,487
Come down on him when he talks about these things

1227
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
Cuz

1228
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
I guess he uses

1229
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
You know all the time

1230
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
East Orange

1231
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,935
Anchor the idea of pedophilia in lgbtq

1232
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
Yeah he's trying to

1233
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
Conflate the two things

1234
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,287
And that's what he always does

1235
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,615
Over and over again

1236
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,687
I mean I don't want to say that he hate

1237
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,551
Every single gay person in the world but it's hard not to feel that way

1238
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,647
I don't care whether you're Christian

1239
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Muslim

1240
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,207
Jewish or

1241
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Are there others

1242
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:48,191
All Muslims are run by murdering pedophiles and I don't get why people think I'm islamophobic

1243
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:54,335
Stop to Cy good workout

1244
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
So

1245
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
You show sucks he's a dick

1246
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,831
Leading into his very clear

1247
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
He's trying to use to

1248
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:12,255
To defend himself against allegations of transphobia

1249
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,071
Is allegations of transphobia

1250
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
Hip Hop

1251
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,959
He's enjoying

1252
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,007
But then even even then like

1253
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:28,639
He could have just stuck with the Transformer your stuff and it said he just wrote everybody in with

1254
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,735
Reality

1255
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:39,135
Everyone in the lgbtq community

1256
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,463
Identities are there all monsters

1257
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,023
Hey you guys didn't tell make me bad enough

1258
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:55,007
Just don't call me whatever you want

1259
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,103
Speedrunning real terrible show is really interests

1260
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
Who will still go on it

1261
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,271
Somebody goes on Coulter was just on the other day

1262
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
Locked up

1263
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,623
Because Alex has spent months to talk about how much you suck

1264
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:16,511
Because she was one of the famous conservatives who turned on Trump

1265
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,799
I bet Adele

1266
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
Yeah definitely

1267
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
And now I guess who's back on trumps

1268
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,199
I'll have her back on the show

1269
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
Sochi

1270
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:44,927
Darrell hamamoto was on the other day my dude

1271
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,255
Instead of anybody else it's just Alex and Daryl co-host

1272
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,839
You have the time for it

1273
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,143
Jarrell hamamoto update

1274
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Better new car

1275
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:06,431
Asian studies professor

1276
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
Researcher on the topic of

1277
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,015
Sacralisation

1278
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Asian males and

1279
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
Culture

1280
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,159
Started

1281
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
The New World Order

1282
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
So

1283
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,559
We reported on this show that he

1284
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,839
Inspired by

1285
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Lucy dacus

1286
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
Because he is no longer working at UC Davis

1287
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,447
I bet he has a

1288
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Composition Dan

1289
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,263
I think he got forced into retirement

1290
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,335
Look at these listed I found their like

1291
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,175
2017 2018 retirees

1292
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223
I would say a lot of them

1293
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Much longer

1294
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,087
They been there many more for 22 years

1295
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,111
As a professor

1296
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,999
There's no reason why you retire except for like

1297
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Dude

1298
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,631
It could be

1299
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:01,471
Probably accept

1300
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
Comfortable.

1301
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
Retirement

1302
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,847
But also

1303
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,615
The show

1304
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,919
And also a

1305
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,455
Viral

1306
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
He was saying that

1307
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,783
There was a

1308
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807

From Antarctica hurricane

1311
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
He speculated that

1312
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,535
John Kerry visited

1313
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
Couple years back

1314
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,607
He was going to check on those weather weapon

1315
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,423
And did not speculate it so much as using

1316
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
This is

1317
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
He's so crazy

1318
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271

01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,999
You're the one who did Google Darrell hamamoto before you took his class

1331
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,535
Leather cursory Google

1332
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
It's kind of on you

1333
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,143
Yeah so

1334
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,191
Two still willing to go and show up

1335
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,383
My dude

1336
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
He is a guy

1337
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,551
If you are if you don't remember the guy who does political cartoons that are over labor

1338
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:55,647
Yeah yeah know what I like

1339
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
Very amateurish hack

1340
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,719
My

1341
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
You know

1342
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,535
A lot of acting

1343
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Will Sage

1344
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
I've never actually

1345
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
They'll say to you acting isn't

1346
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Acting is about

1347
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Subtlety

1348
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
Tumi Ben Garrison

1349
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
Is the

1350
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,432
Comic strip

1351
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,456
Corollary

1352
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,992
That is a man

1353
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
Who maintains

1354
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:28,416
Subtlety as an art form just transforms and then really even transcend

1355
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
The Arc in the in the world of speech

1356
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,072
Brevity is the soul of wit

1357
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Visual

1358
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,656
Analog of aphorism

1359
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
Picture is worth a thousand words

1360
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,544
So long as you write a thousand words

1361
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,688
World is up to 1000 words

1362
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:56,576
He's slightly misinterpreted that today

1363
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
Cartoons of generally like

1364
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Really good clothes

1365
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,208
Beyond that

1366
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,000
I would I would say that

1367
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,024
Kind of living

1368
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
Proof that

1369
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,192
Because the only reason he's all popular is because of

1370
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,240
Freddy reactionary release

1371
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
F***** up

1372
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
Becky's drawn

1373
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,848
Supporting Trump

1374
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,176
His entire career is based on the fact that no one is censoring

1375
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,760
People

1376
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
Agree with

1377
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
What he says

1378
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,136
Cartoon

1379
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,952
It doesn't force them to think about it for

1380
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Even one

1381
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:41,888
Visual metaphors cartoon to look like the words I say

1382
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
I want I want to make sure that even if

1383
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,408
For even one second I never feel the fear of

1384
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,992
Am I going to figure this out have you ever seen the back of a

1385
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,064
Cereal boxes and sometimes they ask you to find the

1386
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
Makes me feel inferior Saint Joseph's for you

1387
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,512
Out for me

1388
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,816
On the back of a cereal box

1389
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:16,192
So we have a Facebook group called go home and tell your mother you're brilliant ever time to time people post Ben Garrison

1390

Cartoon

1391
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:25,152
And every single time I have to wrestle with usually rest I don't usually have this thought

1392
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,200
This is got to be fake

1393
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,760
You're like 8

1394
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:34,624
The joke

1395
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
And I can't tell

1396
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
He has

1397
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,816
Like you know how some people have singular Style

1398
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,776
Saguiguit filthy's fit2

01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,824
To show up on Alex's show

01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,384
None of his.

1402
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,200
Traffic is really shaky idea of what

1403
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Pre-speech me

1404
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,504
Or reality

1405
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:09,184
Playground he just seems to not really understand censorship

1406
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,768
Has to do with none of them do not understand

1407
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,560
But I'm glad the trees

1408
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,328
Speech exist

1409
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,120
For one reason and one reason only

1410
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,912
And that is this next week

1411
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,960
We're Alex Jones.

1412
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
We've critiqued is Guam

1413
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,312
Bernie Sanders

1414
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:32,480
His Dracula Soros impression

1415
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
He did another one

1416
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:40,416
Yeah yeah try and pull out his

1417
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,256
You know the weirdest one was is John Madden

1418

Google high-pitched he wasn't trying to tell me fungus spray

1419
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,592
Bad impression

1420
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
I will say

1421
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
This doesn't least accurate

1422
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,112
Depression

1423
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,184
This work centers is offensive to the mentally handicapped

1424
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
I will sing for that

1425
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
It's much more than this

1426
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,584
This morning

1427
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,352
Like

1428
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,936
Bernie isn't in the ballpark

1429
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:42,112
Hello mr. Christopher Robin

1430
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:46,208
And saw the

1431
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,024
Jokes about

1432
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:54,656
Very important

1433
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,984
Hundred Acre Wood

1434
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:06,432
More like a rapist

1435
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,968
Kermit the Frog

1436
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:14,368
There is an offensive Chinese being the New Smyrna for sir

1437
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
Colonel is Winnie-the-Pooh in there

1438
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,144
Immediately forgot how Winnie the Pooh actually sound like

1439
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
In my head

1440
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
Father

1441
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,056
It's not just a light there's a lilt

1442
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:39,456
There's a lilt to it

1443
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,296
Slightly it's not a British accent but there's a slight bruise What would

1444
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,368
It's like

1445
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,440
Scratch

1446
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Is that lights

1447
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Scratch on it

1448
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:56,096
It's almost like I can hear it in my head now perfectly

1449
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
I can hear it

1450
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,656
Perfectly and I can never recreate

1451
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:05,056
I should say full disclosure fire prevention skit when I was at 7

1452
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,456
If I showed up and did that

1453
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,736
I would have been

1454
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,808
F****** fired from that drop

1455
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,208
All Chinese immigrants

1456
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,768
Play then I really think they would have been right to fire you

1457
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
Ensure

1458
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,680
I just think anybody would I don't know what she sounds like

1459
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:38,336
Inaccurate

1460
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,664
That was Alex just doing

1461
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,224
Yeah that was him

1462
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,552
Like he might as well have said

1463
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:52,928
He's not Jesse Watters legitimately I think what happened

1464
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,976
He said Winnie the Pooh Disney

1465
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Imma go for it

1466
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:02,656
Terrible idea

1467
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:12,128
Yoda

1468
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,432
How do I

1469
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,528
I told you that we're not going to hear much

1470
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,112
From

1471
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,208
The label everything he says

1472
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,560
SoundCloud comments right around

1473
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
He says I want you to say another word that explains the words

1474
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
I can't do that but

1475
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,336
Can you label

1476
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:48,224
Last year

1477
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:56,672
Andrew Anglin

1478
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,000
Most Americans don't see Target

1479
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:13,568
We're going to

1480
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:17,920
We have to protect even unpopular speech

1481
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:24,576
Dollar bills

1482
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:27,392
Just having fun with his you know

1483
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:33,792
Survival stories.

1484
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,608
Successfully got rid of these

1485
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
That's their plan

1486
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,360
So the problem that I have here is the understanding of

1487
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,920
I think I should draw

1488
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,456
Perfect Ben Garrison cartoon

1489
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Look

1490
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,296
Daily Stormer got kicked off of

1491
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,344
You know like PayPal

01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,184
GoDaddy do you mean a giant

1493
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,976
Cumulonimbus cloud with a

1494
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
The calendar on

1495
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
Exactly

1496
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,072
They didn't have their free speech

1497
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,632
Anyway violate

1498
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,912
Oh s***

1499
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:14,496
Let's not helped Nazis raise funds to harass Jews

1500
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,336
And then the business make a decision we don't want to be a part of that

1501
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,616
That's not

1502
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,176
Free Speech being infringed upon

1503
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
No that's

1504
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,992
A company being slightly

1505
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:30,880
We better than Ford Motors that I agree with what you saying in principle the ideas like you have to pee

1506
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672
Protect even abhorrent

1507
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,720
When

1508
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,560
Is saying you can't say those things

1509
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,120
That's not when companies are saying

1510
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,216
Hey you represent something we are absolutely again

1511
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:51,872
So no we don't want to do business with you understood

1512
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:58,272
This is one this is one situation where I am going to put them all on the stupid

1513
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
Continuum

1514
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,368
As opposed to

1515
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Continue

1516
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:10,304
Themselves stupid I think they just don't understand that because that's like the same way

1517
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Alex Jones

1518
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,888
The First Amendment rules apply in f******

1519
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,544
No they think it's some sort of Biblical scripture

1520
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,616
And they don't understand what it is like

1521
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:27,456
It kind of like works with that grandiosity

1522
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,736
Grandiose delusion

1523
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
You think that all of the world

1524
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,856
Should treat you the same everywhere you go

1525
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,696
I agree with you to stomach

1526
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,536
It's a calculation on their part

1527
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,560
Because they realized

1528
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
F***

1529
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:50,496
Their behavior got them kicked off of these things that we need in order to make the money

1530
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,312
We are probably the next

1531
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
In the crosshairs because

1532
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,872
Let's be clear we've done

1533
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Pretty bad

1534
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:02,016
Like not a legal stuff we've done stuff it's obviously

1535
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:08,160
People's sensibilities misrepresent

1536
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,952
Like I don't I don't

1537
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
That's why

1538
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,536
The present-day I think it's such a stupid

1539
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:19,680
I'm sure it's because of the stupid f******

1540
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
Free Speech martyrdom campaign

1541
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
He's going on

1542
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
Like it

1543
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,544
Not

1544
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,896
I knows it

1545
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,944
Were someone who likes Alex Jones

1546
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
To listen to the show

1547
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:38,624
They would probably be like hey why aren't you wrestling

1548
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
Which is

1549
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,304
I don't care I don't I reject that as an idea

1550
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,584
If you had history

1551
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
Taken away by the state

1552
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:56,800
Right like if the state were saying shut down Alex Jones we're actually doing

1553
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
The president

1554
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:02,176
In fact came out and said that a private company should do this

1555
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:06,784
I ordered something and then turned it into a law

1556
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,064
For further

1557
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,856
If those companies of Alex good

1558
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,672
Like legitimately prove that they were all working

1559
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,696
Together against

1560
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,488
Like the NFL again

1561
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,560
Wait

1562
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,608
If you could prove those

1563
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,144
A different conversation

1564
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:23,936
Those things

1565
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,960
Anyway before

1566
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,520
It's a valid argument on Free Speech crown

1567
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
Right

1568
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,336
It's just an a******

1569
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
Brothers

1570
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,896
He's getting what he deserves

1571
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,992
It's not interesting to me even as a conversation

1572
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
And it's just

1573
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
If you had

1574
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,648
You became a millionaire by being a dick

1575
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
Last forever

1576
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,840
Almost all the time

1577
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
Sometimes

1578
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
Real cool ride

1579
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,240
Eventually they even got

1580
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,056
And he was protected

1581
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
Sprite

1582
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
Comes for you

1583
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:11,040
He hides behind like his perception of himself as a Libertarian

1584
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
To do whatever you want

1585
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
Right

1586
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Because he doesn't understand

1587
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
I think that you just

1588
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:26,912
I don't know

1589
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
Into the Birch Society when he was younger

1590
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,800
John Birch Society

1591
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,872
Fell in love with Ron Paul at some point

1592
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,944
Quite frankly I think that I'd left to do with politics

1593
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,832
I think that because Ron Paul probably identified

1594
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,112
To have more libertarian

1595
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,696
Libertarian

1596
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,048
I don't know how to find

1597
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
Libertarian

1598
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Ever

1599
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
The believer

1600
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:04,544
You have more than three Libertarians in a room you will have a disagreement

1601
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,360
That's my that's my

1602
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:12,992
Is that your taxi immatics

1603
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:19,392
Free on anything except they're not f****** Republicans that's all they agree on

1604
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,976
What what is is an identity that's like

1605
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,536
Call ourselves

1606
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Nothing

1607
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,448
Is that Republicans we don't want to call

1608
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
It's more it's more just like a

1609
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
How would I put that

1610
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
It's

1611
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,992
There's High School mentality

1612
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,784
Needing to Define yourself as something

1613
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
In opposition to

1614
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:53,952
Right right you are mostly just believe everything

1615
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,744
You've got to choose some other things

1616
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
If you want to feel

1617
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,400
Maybe you like pop music

1618
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,448
Identifier

1619
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,752
They can't find

1620
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
Identified

1621
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Themselves so they have

1622
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
Negative

1623
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,336
They have the negative

1624
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,504
Articulate

1625
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,136
But

1626
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:30,304
Makes pretty f****** clear but even nowhere near any kind of libertarian

1627
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
Is the

1628
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,176
You can have your terms of service and remove it

1629
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:51,552
But but only for reasons that violate law you can't

1630
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
Whatever you want

1631
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,952
Schewels

1632
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:02,304
Teaching three-year-olds that their difference

1633
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,656
Men in Drag

1634
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,432
I don't want involved with the kids

1635
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
What

1636
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,528
Facebook

1637
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,320
You bullied

1638
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:30,720
Cuz our public figures your children

1639
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,072
Because

1640
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,264
Lgbtq

1641
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
You just know

1642
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Crossdressers

1643
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:06,048
They're closed their clown they're closed

1644
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,424
I don't understand why people would think that is a transphobic thing to say

1645
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,776
I'm just saying that every part of what it is you are

1646
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:20,384
Is a clown legitimately when he's trying to defend himself

1647
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
In his speech of like

1648
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:26,016
Is it crazy to think that I'm some kind of an ant

1649
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,552
He is an a****** about it

1650
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,624
Delivered

1651
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,024
I want them to write a law regulating everybody else's speech to give me

1652
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,424
Free rein to do whatever it is you need to unpack

1653
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
Quite a bit more

1654
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,752
Because the other stuff we could Alex

1655
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:52,384
Just checking on your transfer via homophobia

1656
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
Homophobic

1657
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
F******

1658
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,248
Absolute bigot you're a

1659
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:02,880
It is the same thing as like he's scared to see Muslim women at

1660
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
The pool shop

1661
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:10,048
Muslim women at home

1662
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,096
I think it was the Wall Street Journal

1663
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:16,704
No I don't even know I don't need specifics

1664
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
I did not read okay

1665
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:21,568
There is this there's this person

1666
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,592
Let's let's

1667
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,152
Lyft

1668
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
And wrote this

1669
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
Usually

1670
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,136
Islamophobic piece that was like

1671
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,464
And so when I was a kid I went there

1672
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
And I saw somebody

1673
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
In Endicott

1674
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,400
Terrify

1675
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:52,800
My favorite my favorite

1676
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,824
What is the

1677
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
It was like

1678
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,920
And then I saw a sign that said

1679
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,224
No alcohol allowed here now

1680
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,016
This must be the Muslim

1681
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
And then you're like

1682
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,064
Dude

1683
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,648
London allows alcohol everywhere

1684
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
Except for places

1685
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,720
We're assholes

1686
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:14,560
That has nothing to do with any religion and everything to do with

1687
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Assholes

1688
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,912
Unlike in America

1689
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,216
AA most places are like

1690
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:26,336
New Orleans where you can just walk around with beer wherever you want and there's only specific Zone

1691
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,360
Where people have

1692
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:38,368
Stupid amazing and that people are just going to believe that s*** is so that's a justification for their islamophobia

1693
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,136
Bananas

1694
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,440
Lauren Southern

1695
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,208
But you posted not to

1696
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
Longo where she was

1697
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,536
People in America

1698
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,328
Has like a weather

1699
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:55,008
Arabic restaurant right here but where is there a where is there a British restaurant

1700
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,200
Whoops

1701
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,760
Because

1702
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
If anyone who has the in

1703
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,088
Information can answer the question

1704
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
That's generally

1705
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,648
Write an op-ed

1706
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:16,000
Cuz there's no or or they just use

1707
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:17,280
Like people

1708
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,072
Selectively that they talked

1709
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,128
In order to make people afraid of something

1710
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,712
And then don't believe the rest of the day

1711
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,344
No I can't think of anything like that

1712
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,952
Regulation

1713
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,232
A little bit more

1714
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,512
I really need

1715
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
Because it's very important

1716
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,864
So Alex is anti-regulation

1717
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
As a rule

1718
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
Buddy

1719
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,776
He wants regulation on the internet as a free speech Act

1720
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:03,616
Order to make it so they could not be any

1721
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,432
Hold on hold on

1722
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,992
Sorry that's just a fun name for an act

1723
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,552
First Amendment act you know

1724
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:14,624
Unlike the first

1725
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
These people can't have regulator

1726
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
McGovern

1727
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,608
What they will or will not

1728
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,376
Except

1729
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,680
In terms of Internet

1730
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
The problem was that

1731
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,240
I can see no problem

1732
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:36,384
I mean obviously we apply to anybody would apply to like if you have a Blog

1733
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,432
And someone leaves a comment that you don't like

1734
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,248
Commit a crime

1735
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,296
You just

1736
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,624
You just proved you're approved how great thou tactic

1737
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,184
Yuki you don't have control over your own

1738
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,816
We have knowledge

1739
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,864
And a lot of people that left

1740
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,400
Realtruck.com

1741
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,432
Particularly

1742
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:13,760
And then what I do is I

1743
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:20,160
Take point

1744
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,976
Absolutely a billionaire

1745
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
Suspicious

1746
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
5 but

1747
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:27,328
This Pacific point

1748
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,888
Stupid the globalist propaganda

1749
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
You know all that s***

1750
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,984
Atlantic

1751
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,080
And you know what you don't want to

1752
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,480
Engaged

1753
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Terrebonne

1754
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
Monster X

1755
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,320
Damn,

1756
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,392
Or $25 or whatever

1757
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,928
Not illegal

1758
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,488
Now I can't erase that from the website

1759
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,048
I can't clean up our comment section

1760
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
That's not a crime

1761
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,376
For them to advertise in our comments

1762
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,960
Or not we need a regulation saying that it is a crime

1763
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:08,544
Fruit advertising in order for you to clean up spam

1764
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,824
Comments to come in

1765
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,152
You understand the problematic

1766
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,968
Territory he's entering into in terms of

1767
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:19,040
No regulations on the internet say whatever you want

1768
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,064
Normally

1769
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,368
Facetiously

1770
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,136
Buck against

1771
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
Intake

1772
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,208
The the wrong side

1773
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,488
As a joke

1774
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,256
But I

1775
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,328
Nah that's dumb dude

1776
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,752
Don't worry

1777
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,032
A harassment

1778
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:44,384
Sometimes as a key area of whether it's illegal or not

1779
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,920
And you should be punished for it

1780
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,712
Because

1781
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,480
Decorum

1782
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,296
Lakers much better arguments than

1783
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,136
Hey Alex

1784
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,184
Create the free speech

1785
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
The First Amendment Act

1786
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
With a caveat

1787
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,120
Sunglasses

1788
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:09,216
Or whatever

1789
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,776
Especially after today

1790
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,544
Just

1791
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,592
Just the barrage of

1792
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,616
Stupidity

1793
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,152
That the internet game

1794
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,712
I-i'm just like

1795
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,248
You know what I am

1796
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,040
Trump

1797
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:23,808
EPA

1798
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,088
I want them to

1799
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:27,648
To deregulate all CO2 emissions

1800
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:31,744
I want everything to be in the atmosphere because you know it's really going to happen

1801
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
Everybody's going to die

1802
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
Except

1803
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
Billionaire

1804
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,680
They're going to have their their Castle

1805
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:42,496
Closer whatever

1806
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:48,896
Call Dwayne.

1807
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:54,784
Guess what it gets we haven't come into a foot like a hundred of us are going to live in Peter teals f****** Island

1808
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,368
Going to eat the Peter deal bones were going to make

1809
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:04,768
I know there's not a lot of calories in it

1810
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:11,168
Lakers first first first

1811
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,960
Hat on a goddamn spy

1812
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,240
Ana Lorde

1813
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:18,080
Exactly like Lord of Lies better than that

1814
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,872
We're better than that

1815
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,224
Experiment

1816
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:31,648
That is a fun piece of literature but also doesn't necessarily to pick the once again

1817
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:34,720
As we've stated previously

1818
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,280
Most people come together in China

1819
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:42,144
Help each other

1820
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
So

1821
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
But

1822
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
How long is

1823
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
On this ride

1824
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,920
I don't need to bring up again how weird

1825
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
Esoteric

1826
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,528
But he's twice tried to talk about how he

1827
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
He's not against

1828
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,856
People doing so

1829
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Has been

1830
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
Very much

1831
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,464
Inflate the ideas of

1832
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,744
Queer identities

1833
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,024
With pedophilia

1834
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,608
He's been very explicit about being against

1835
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,144
Sir being against trans

1836
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,448
So I

1837
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
I don't

1838
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,264
I don't want to talk about that

1839
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
Because

1840
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,872
Who cares

1841
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,664
Anyways at is dismissive

1842
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,200
The feelings of people who

1843
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,760
Because I do understand that

1844
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
You could

1845
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
You know trans identify

1846
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,856
People would probably be like

1847
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
Hey motherfuker

1848
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:37,184
Your rhetoric is so dehumanizing

1849
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
Sing about

1850
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:45,120
Now you want to use us as the way to get your jollies you know that sort of thing I don't want to take

1851
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,912
Away from that I respect that position

1852
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:50,752
That's not an argument I can make that's for them to make and I back them up 100%

1853
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:55,872
The only thing that I care about first of all is that he clearly was looking at p***

1854
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
At work

1855
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,968
Which is very

1856
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
I think it's

1857
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,016
I think

1858
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Leet

1859
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,320
Profession

1860
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,600
I think there's that

1861
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,392
It's sexual

1862
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,440
Just about every work

1863
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,000
We get to the bigger issue

1864
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,792
Which brings us to our last

1865
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,840
And that is

1866
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,632
Because everyone

1867
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,984
Doesn't really hurt him all that much

1868
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:23,776
He's going

1869
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,056
Use that to his benefit

1870
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:35,808
Trolling operation for Soros text messaging

1871
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,856
Story of the world

1872
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:52,192
Call Trina

1873
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,520
This is what I

1874
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,080
Like another perfect example

1875
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,896
Earlier in the show

1876
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:04,992
That Bon Iver song is really fun

1877
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,296
I'm glad everyone's having a fun time with

1878
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:09,344
You need to realize how propaganda

1879
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,624
We'll use the response

1880
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,160
That you give it to them

1881
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,256
I don't think Alex is going to follow through with it

1882
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:19,840
That's his way of reclaiming

1883
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:25,216
I got out of that

1884
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:29,056
He claims it is just like always a pop-up

1885
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,104
XVideos

1886
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,384
The screen that's not

1887
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,664
It's not where pop-ups

1888
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,064
Mike Sheehan

1889
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
The store

1890
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:45,184
Go to specific places that'll give you a virus

1891
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
Or they go to places

1892
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,256
AmVet Archer

1893
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:54,656
Covid-19

1894
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,336
So but he's trying to use that too

1895
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
Play mint

1896
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,664
Like I'm going to f*** with people even more

1897
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,688
Indian places

1898
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,760
Piece of Advent maybe I was f****** with them that time

1899
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,112
He's a good propaganda

1900
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:26,656
Lil Bit no one really understands the issue

1901
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,216
And then

1902
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,032
Man you should just not

1903
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
Like gay issue

1904
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
Issues at all

1905
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,200
Resist making it bad

1906
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
That's because he is

1907
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,576
I think that there are like

1908
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,368
The stories that he

1909
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
Wants to cover

1910
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,928
Some of them have

1911
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
Like Blake

1912
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,512
Do a better job like

1913
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,536
About the Catholic Church

1914
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:01,216
Again

1915
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,240
Pedophilia

1916
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,336
Cover that much better because

1917
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,384
Does

1918
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,152
Thrift

1919
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,944
Real big

1920
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
I hate

1921
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
I hate this

1922
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,880
I really do you were

1923
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,160
For not being effervescence

1924
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,208
Earlier in the show

1925
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,488
Because I just got done

1926
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,304
Listening to shopping list

1927
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,608
It sucks

1928
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,632
I know

1929
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,264
Mine is

1930
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,544
Samsung music

1931
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,080
Infinitely easier

1932
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
Cypress

1933
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
God dammit

1934
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,016
This

1935
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,808
Bigger issue

1936
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,344
What is Winnie-the-Pooh

1937
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,160
Oh man

1938
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:57,280
I don't want

1939
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,816
To keep covering

1940
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Present

1941
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,376
I know that I keep choosing

1942
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,680
There's a sick fascination

1943
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
It's like

1944
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,800
Is that

1945
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,104
Schrodinger's podcast

1946
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,384
Or whatever you know like

1947
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:19,296
Maybe it's never Oreo other board

1948
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,064
Until You observe

1949
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,624
And maybe

1950
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,696
Hit hit a reset button

1951
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,720
From

1952
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:33,632
Like maybe it would have felt like we were copping out by doing a

1953
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,168
Jim Bakker

1954
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,728
Yeah yeah if we were just going to clown on Summit

1955
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,520
2 hours

1956
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
I don't know

1957
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,568
There's a lot of issues that I need

1958
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
But

1959
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:57,440
Website

1960
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:01,792
What is that website

1961
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:08,960
Call Manufacturing

1962
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:09,984
The moment I'm just

1963
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,264
I'm just

1964
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,800
Unsure of

1965
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,360
Any other ways

1966
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Forward

1967
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
With this episode

1968
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,736
All of that stuff

1969
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:23,040
If we were if we weren't our show

1970
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:26,112
If we were just a mainstream news Outlet trying to cover news

1971
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,416
All of it I would think

1972
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,184
Is just like

1973
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:31,744
There's more

1974
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,840
You know like all of this s*** every time

1975
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,144
We get a rundown of

1976
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,936
Dumbass Trump

1977
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Tweetstorm

1978
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,288
No

1979
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,824
You don't get this

1980
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
This isn't

1981
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,408
You don't win

1982
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,712
Giving you attention

1983
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,736
So you don't get

1984
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
Did time you lose

1985
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,576
And it's the only way to make you lose

1986
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,856
It's just a f***

1987
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
You were not

1988
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,696
Talking about you grow the f******

1989
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:05,024
Every Trump headline on like Google News shouldn't be like

1990
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:09,376
Trump at 6 a.m. tweeted this Butch bullshittin

1991
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,424
Trump said some dumb s***

1992
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:16,032
Because everybody f****** knows I get doesn't matter

1993
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:16,800
I disagree

1994
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,080
I think

1995
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:25,248
But I think there is probably a hypothetical version

1996
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,528
Covering

1997
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,320
Leica is dumb

1998
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:33,184
Like in a real version there's a way to do it like I do

1999
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,208
For someone to do it

2000
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,744
But everyone does it wrong

2001
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,560
So we keep coming back to about the Alexa

2002
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,608
Natura propaganda and the emotion

2003
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
The two sides of the sea

2004
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:48,288
What is manifesting

2005
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:54,176
I'm going to troll people like that

2006
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,992
No

2007
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,272
People like Alex

2008
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,552
People like Trump

2009
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
People like

2010
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,112
Most of the

2011
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,136
Active participant

2012
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:03,904
In the right

2013
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,952
The alt right now

2014
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
They know

2015
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,024
Dino the game

2016
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:12,096
They're trying to elicit the response

2017
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:12,864
That most

2018
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,632
People give them

2019
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,936
Because it

2020
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,472
Advantageous to them

2021
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,752
They have no shame

2022
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,032
The reason

2023
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
It's not a big

2024
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,824
Bo4 Alex

2025
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,360
In his own heart

2026
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,640
Tubi

2027
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
Seeing

2028
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,248
With a window of pornography open on his phone

2029
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,784
That wasn't history

2030
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,552
Open

2031
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,600
In his phone as a window

2032
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,880
The reason

2033
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
Not shameful

2034
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
There's no shame there's no problem

2035
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,000
He knows what he

2036
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:40,768
He's doing he's

2037
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:41,536
Crazy

2038
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,560
He's just

2039
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,584
He is

2040
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,376
Talking

2041
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
Just

2042
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,424
Dorsey

2043
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:48,960
Transmuting

2044
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,728
Fear

2045
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,008
White identity

2046
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,288
Chauvinism

2047
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,592
Anti-islam feeling

2048
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Into

2049
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,432
Who's the Pope

2050
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,480
Exactly

2051
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:03,296
No I

2052
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,600
They don't all have pill operation

2053
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:08,928
Put all of them quick whether it's

2054
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:13,280
Ben Shapiro height

2055
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:17,120
Exact

2056
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,912
In an order to run the game

2057
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:21,984
You have to elicit the response out of the other side

2058
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,776
That feeds

2059
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,568
Now we don't

2060
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:26,592
Elicit that

2061
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,616
Response like

2062
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:30,432
We hear him

2063
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,760
You're not going to give me

2064
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,576
Petulant child screaming that wants attention

2065
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,368
Giving him attention

2066
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,416
His show

2067
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,440
You could interpret it

2068
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,072
I think it would be

2069
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,864
He would have brought us up and

2070
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,168
Parade around

2071
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
We do is beat

2072
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
His rhetoric on

2073
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,872
Angie

2074
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,664
There is a version of that way

2075
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,688
With all of

2076
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,456
The alt right

2077
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
Trump included

2078
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,088
Just not

2079
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,112
What is Mos

2080
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,184
That is exactly

2081
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,976
How I feel about it

2082
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,768
It's

2083
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:17,792
It's that

2084
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,352
It's at double-sided you know like

2085
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,120
Hey

2086
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,680
To Alex Jones

2087
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,984
This benefit is to elicit that reaction

2088
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,568
The Atlantic benefit

2089
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:31,104
Is to respond to that

2090
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:35,200
Because then they get more click right

2091
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,808
They cover that b******* the way that they

2092
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:46,208
It's pretty lit.

2093
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:48,512
That infuriated me I'd like

2094
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:52,864
I don't know what it is I don't know why Atlantic I think it's just

2095
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,144
Out of pure heart

2096
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,448
Hatred

2097
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,496
Feel like I hate Reid

2098
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:01,824
But this one this one thing this guy wrote was like

2099
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,920
It turns out children don't trust the mainstream media anymore

2100
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:11,552
And there's no reason that I can think of why you guys are a f****** failure

2101
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,112
Why do children need a trust

2102
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,672
You're interested

2103
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:26,400
Linda f****** Ellerbe doing what's wrong with you

2104
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:29,728
My lovely daughter babe

2105
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,520
It is it is not

2106
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,312
It's not that I wanted like

2107
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,968
Like maybe it until until then

2108
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:45,088
Like because now the the martyrdom of the mainstream media

2109
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,648
Praise because

2110
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,952
A goddamn appointment

2111
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
Until the news media

2112
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,120
Until they're willing and capable of

2113
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,400
Exam themselves

2114
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,448
And how it is that they too

2115
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:02,496
Have enabled all of this s*** to happen

2116
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:05,056
How they too are at fault

2117
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:08,640
They're the enemy of the America

2118
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:17,344
Why did this come about how did this guy come about

2119
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,392
Guess what

2120
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,160
You are

2121
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:24,256
F****** culpable to be complicit

2122
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
Never happened

2123
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:28,352
They're just like oh now we're the victims are doing the same

2124
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,912
Fit the f****** idiots did

2125
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,520
They have spell

2126
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
I'm serious

2127
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,408
No response sorry

2128
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,992
Sorry, I'm sorry

2129
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:49,600
You asked me if I had any

2130
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,904
I mostly agree with

2131
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,952
I think I lost

2132
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:54,976
Couple of the points

2133
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:02,656
I do agree at Large

2134
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,192
Doesn't

2135
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:07,008
Because they're not recognizing the game

2136
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:11,360
And I kept trying to interject

2137
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:14,176
I'm sorry for that

2138
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:18,016
The same thing with like

2139
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,576
Especially in the WWE

2140
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
Is that like

2141
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,904
Who cares if it's good or bad if it

2142
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:29,024
So your healer your face

2143
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:31,840
He doesn't matter unless you're getting a reaction

2144
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,912
The worst thing is getting no reaction

2145
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:38,240
You're the best wrestler in the world

2146
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,776
And no one is like

2147
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,312
Interested at all

2148
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:44,384
You're dead in the water

2149
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,456
We've shifted to a place where

2150
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:51,040
Like legitimately understanding pro wrestling

2151
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,576
I think it's going to be

2152
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:57,952
The most important thing moving forward.

2153
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,000
Internal

2154
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:03,328
You can understand why they're doing that

2155
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,608
He's being a shitheel

2156
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,376
You know

2157
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,960
Sphero challenging someone to a debate and then

2158
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:14,848
Bailing on the debate when they didn't reach whatever qualifications

2159
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:17,664
The Cowardly heel

2160
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,992
Or whatever you know

2161
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:24,576
They're all playing by weird wrestling Playbook

2162
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:27,136
And it's not it's not conducive

2163
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,416
Two things going well

2164
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:30,464
And when the media trying to be like

2165
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,024
We are just here

2166
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
Is B

2167
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,168
Trick bike

2168
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,216
Over and over and over and over

2169
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:45,312
Do you make you make a great point at the same time

2170
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,640
End up looking f****** stupid

2171
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,944
Because those are the people

2172
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:57,344
Constantly get tricked by the heels exactly responding to the heels doing obviously evil

2173
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,720
There's nothing

2174
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,768
Things to do other than be I guess

2175
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:07,328
The shity fan who's watching

2176
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:13,472
We are

2177
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,056
You just you just

2178
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,848
Encapsulated it

2179
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,640
Perfectly because I do

2180
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
Professional

2181
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
Is

2182
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,528
Just as much info

2183
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:28,064
Interested in the

2184
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,088
As they are in

2185
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,696
Probably do you know what I'm saying

2186
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,768
Accurate

2187
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:40,608
I don't disagree but what I know

2188
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:44,192
As far as compared to watch wrestling

2189
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,240
In the in the

2190
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,080
Sarah versus now

2191
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,432
Sorry I caused

2192
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,968
Like I'm early 30s

2193
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:56,992
Is your late 20s

2194
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:59,040
I think it's because there's a

2195
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:05,440
Okay because I can play a 26

2196
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,840
There is a difference

2197
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:13,120
Between

2198
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,168
Knowing

2199
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:19,008
While working Arthur Vines

2200
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:25,664
Regal

2201
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,456
You know like wrestling now

2202
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,552
Beautiful mind I retract that

2203
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,320
Entirely

2204
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,648
Without that

2205
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,416
Bulshit

2206
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,512
Tell that book personal

2207
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,048
It is that

2208
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:46,656
Distance of recognizing the Mediterra

2209
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,448
As being

2210
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:49,728
You can watch

2211
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,288
So is recognizing The Meta narrative

2212
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,848
Are our current

2213
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,640
Political propaganda

2214
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,664
Importance

2215
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
Like to

2216
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
Recognized

2217
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:00,992
Even if

2218
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,784
The individual reporters

2219
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,808
At the New York time

2220
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:08,416
And their boss said no

2221
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:10,976
You got to write a thousand words on block

2222
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,280
Somebody at the New York time

2223
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,560
Recognize

2224
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,584
The matinee

2225
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:17,888
I know

2226
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,704
We have to respond

2227
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,496
Just because it's going to get us

2228
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,776
Traffic

2229
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:25,056
Then if we don't

2230
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,336
Bright

2231
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:29,152
There is there are people who recognize that

2232
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,688
Who are playing the game

2233
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,480
And we're not

2234
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:35,040
Like you and I probably are but like

2235
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:40,672
Most people are not playing that game

2236
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:45,536
Wrestling is real like I don't know I don't know what to tell brother

2237
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:51,424
Back then

2238
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:54,496
The metaphorical version were talking about

2239
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,520
Goes over

2240
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,872
In the real world it's like

2241
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,640
Bombed

2242
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:04,480
Yemen people are giant

2243
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:06,528
The rohingya people are still being

2244
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,808
Like Slaughter

2245
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:12,160
Definitely deserve that Nobel

2246
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:17,536
Super sure recognizing similarities

2247
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,328
Incredibly important because

2248
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,608
You can't allow yourself

2249
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,376
Debated

2250
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,912
In the way that

2251
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,680
People like

2252
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:29,312
Bates and what's so f***** up about it is that sometimes there are things that are

2253
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:33,152
He didn't mean for his phone to show that

2254
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,456
Salute

2255
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:42,112
It still provides him an opportunity

2256
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:42,880
Appositive

2257
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
And you need to

2258
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,208
People need to recognize

2259
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,792
Message with large Soap Box

2260
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,608
People need to recognize that

2261
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:57,984
Recognize the instances of like this is a viable thing to

2262
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,032
Like

2263
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,056
And things

2264
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
Yeah like we

2265
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,920
Thousand

2266
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:08,992
Thousand

2267
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,272
About

2268
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,808
