00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
Yeah Jordan what was the last time

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
You saw somebody

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
Truly astonishing

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
I saw that too gymnast

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Gymnastics

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
In the floor routine that was going around

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
On Twitter

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,792
Remember to the young lady's name but that was

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,192
Outstandingly good she's the one that was like 13 years old

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Call CLA

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,176
Holy s*** it's insane the people's bodies

14
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
I can do that

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
Then I guess I'm a recording is on Sunday but last night I watched at NXT takeover Phoenix

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,672
Ricochet ricochet

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,768
Phoenix is alright alright

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:10,912
There's a wrestler Ricochet amazing flips like he could jump over stuff

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
Physically

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,368
Tate's bake shop

21
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,560
Gyros and of course everyone knows that that is already

22
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
And that is what I started playing Hyrule warriors on the switch

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
Rodger Stone got arrested on Friday you got indicted

24
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
People are clamoring for our take on it

25
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
And so we will get to that

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Before we get to that

27
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
To give a shout out

28
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Show possible

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Nice people

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Ewok

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
First I'd like to carry

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
You are now a policy wonk

33
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Las Animas

34
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,152
Terrible

35
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
You are now policy

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
You are now a policy wonk

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,768
I don't know

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
Harley

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
You are a founding member of the John Birch Society or just anybody else

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Amerigroup

41
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Quick nut button

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
The sports show

43
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Please do

44
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Like I said

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Rodger Stone

46
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Is that

47
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
He got indicted

48
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
And being Rodger Stone

49
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
His primary brand is basically being a dick

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,968
So no one's really going to go soft on him

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,344
He's most famous for our the movie get me Rodger Stone

52
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Fastest time in the barrel is coming

53
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
Prior to the John podesta emails being

54
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
So

55
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Things that are so f****** easy

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
For people to make headlines about it's just a sea of people doing like

57
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
Mother said get me Rodger stone or time in the

58
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
That's terrible

59
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
On himself

60
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Itaki

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,208
Becoming the recipient

62
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,167
I wish people be a little more creative but on another level I kind of enjoy it

63
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
He has to just be thinking like

64
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,615
Why is everybody being so mean to me

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,991
I think I'm a nice guy

66
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
You know what you can't even make a 40-year career out of f****** people over without eventually

67
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Happened to deal with

68
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
That's bulshit nonsense in a global

69
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
To get with this information but I guess I should probably just assume that everybody doesn't know any

70
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
We're going to be going over

71
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Friday's episode of Alex Jones Show

72
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
What would that have been

73
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
25th

74
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
25th 2019

75
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
It's in the immediate aftermath of Rodger getting arrested and posting bail

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
You got arrested at

77
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Like 6 in the morning

78
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
I believe

79
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
FBI agents

80
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Which I think is a good idea

81
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,167
I think the based on the things that he's up to and the other contacts that he has I would consider him

82
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
A flight risk for sure

83
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
You're going to want to surprise that's what I

84
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
I wouldn't I wouldn't take any chances

85
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Took him away

86
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,623
Pretty soon after that him and his lawyers were able to negotiate bail

87
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
He posted a

88
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
$50,000 Bond

89
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
YouMail free

90
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
To go to New York

91
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
Florida

92
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
DC in Florida

93
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
That's correct.

94
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
You could have got Austin on that list

95
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
I need it and I think that tells you something

96
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,247
Infowars

97
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Even if you make that argument there nothing

98
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
DC or New York City to close to Canada

99
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Close to any of these arguments would hold water if Rodger Stone wanted to he could have gotten

100
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
And I think that's partially

101
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
Because

102
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
Open large

103
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Addicted

104
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
In many ways

105
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
Now that he's actually been indicted realizes Alex

106
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Can't really help him

107
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Outside of

108
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Tricking his listeners into giving him money

109
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
That's the only thing I can help

110
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
His problems are much bigger than Alex can help with now

111
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
And so it's not a priority for him

112
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
He's going to use the

113
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Infowars Army

114
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Or whatever for whatever

115
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
But he's not going to

116
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
He's not going to be Rodger Stone anymore

117
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
So

118
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Really boring really fat

119
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
And he'll direct his attention on places where like Trump actually

120
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Is listening

121
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
Tucker Carlson on Fox and Friends

122
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Like helping Alex

123
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,695
The troops for their imaginary apocalyptic battle for coming

124
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
To the forest as well

125
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
There is a great moment in the in his press conference

126
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
We don't have

127
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
An interviewer asks

128
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Have you asked

129
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Rogers responses Park

130
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,271
I don't think he was trying to be funny but it's hilarious

131
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
Here we go let's go let's go

132
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
We'll get through it the best we can

133
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
We're going to be going over this indictment here bit by bit as we go through the episode

134
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,055
Unspeakable

135
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Six-count indictment

136
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Against Rodger Stone on Friday

137
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Count to 36 are all lies

138
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
Rodger told the house intelligence committee

139
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Account one is an obstruction charge

140
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Regarding some message

141
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,231
That Rodger sent critico is supposed intermediary with Julian Assange

142
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,119
Reading over this indictment one gets a very strong sense that Rodger is completely f*****

143
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
The obstruction charge

144
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
To carry a 20-year sentence

145
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Each charge of lying to Congress could be up to five years

146
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
But I don't mean that Rogers f***

147
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Because that's a total of fifty years you could look

148
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Be looking at

149
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Which is

150
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
I mean he's f***** because of the in

151
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Information that's laid out in the document

152
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
And more importantly

153
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
The information that is conspicuous in a

154
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Absence

155
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
The text messages of emails that are referenced

156
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,743
Mostly but not all correspondences that had already come to light in some manner or another

157
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,607
Summer messages that came out Windsor on Coursey got in trouble like a month or two ago

158
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Somewhere reported on vacuum

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
2018 when Randy credico

160
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Investigator

161
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
But there are a few pieces of information in the

162
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Take me to bring it all together

163
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Clearly demonstrate that Rodger Stone

164
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Intentionally misled the house until

165
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Maybe

166
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
And gives a strong indication as to why

167
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
There's no fat in that.

168
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Which I think is

169
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Interesting point

170
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,927
Mother clearly has so many more emails and texts

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Then the ones referenced in this

172
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Is because there is enough

173
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Rodger Stone to be charged with a crime

174
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Have some of the other correspondences

175
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Is may contain information related to other crimes

176
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
Particularly the correspondence

177
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
3 Rodger in Jerome Court

178
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
I could be wrong but that's my heart

179
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Either way Rogers f***

180
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,551
Because this indictment lays out a really open and shut case

181
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Did Rodger is

182
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Super guilty of the crime scene

183
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Another way he's f*****

184
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
Is that prisoner's dilemma

185
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,119
The two of them know a lot of dirt on each other and are both really bad people

186
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Each of them knows that

187
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
The other is a threat

188
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
Typically you never want to be in a prisoner's dilemma with someone who you know is untrustworthy

189
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
And there are few people are few people in town who are less trustworthy than Paul manafort

190
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
And Rodger cell

191
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Sodexo

192
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Just a broad glimpse

193
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Right what's going on

194
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
In order to discuss this indictment in its proper context

195
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
I need to give

196
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
You in the listeners

197
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
A little backstory

198
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Flush out somebody aspect

199
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
And other

200
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
Some of these aspects of the story that other non Infowars Focus

201
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Outlets might've

202
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
So

203
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
Alex Jones isn't the only person in our story who has a radio show

204
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Or more accurately

205
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
On August 15th 2016 Genesis communication

206
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Network distributed a press release

207
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
Rodger Stone every Saturday

208
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
The show was short-lived on GCI which isn't suspicious at all

209
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
I say

210
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,119
Field by World crisis radio host by Webster

211
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
The former Infowars Gaston

212
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Early 2016 when he realized the drop was an aspiring fashion

213
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
Very bizarrely the co-host of Rodger Stones show Stone Cold Truth

214
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
Is a comedian named Travis Irvine

215
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Definitely hung out with multiple times

216
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
I've done shows with Travis

217
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
And at no point could I have possibly imagined that he would end up being the co-host

218
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,255
Rodger Stone radio show world is very weird

219
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,863
Weird is I know that he was a Libertarian Dewdney ran for mayor of his

220
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
His child

221
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
I knew that but I imagine he was this far

222
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
Teaming up with Rodger Stone four radio show

223
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
If somebody gave me that offer

224
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
I would

225
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
To think about it hard because

226
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
F****** hilarious

227
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
I agree with

228
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Cupid also you got to consider the idea might end up

229
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Play something something you don't realize you're getting

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Involved

231
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Anytime you agree to a project with Rodger Stone you know it comes with the possibility of a stoop

232
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,567
Calculus

233
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Either way

234
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Number of this episode

235
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
The show

236
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Travis easy

237
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Involved with Rodger Stone

238
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
But the show it really seems like Rodger just has him there

239
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Do use a sort of a millennial stew

240
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Kind of thing

241
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't I don't know I don't want to assume that they're related

242
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
You're back early is

243
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Anything like that but

244
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,655
It's really f***** up I think he's a really nice guy

245
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
Rodger releases first episode on August 20th

246
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
Ventura

247
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,687
I listen to a bunch of episodes

248
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
And way more

249
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Centration

250
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
Wall2wall Trump campaigning

251
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,743
Define whatever you'd like to show itself is like

252
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
It almost is like trying to take Alex Jones and make it my PR

253
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
That's the kind of more like irresponsible with their report

254
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
August 3rd episode

255
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
From September 3rd 2016

256
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Rodger interview with Randy credico

257
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,991
Inconsequential much just talk about how Rodger and Randy sported some

258
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Reform measures

259
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
That's the point

260
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
The only thing that really stands out to me

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Is how Rodger introduced

262
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Decredico on this episode

263
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Incredible

264
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Metaphysics

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
From the dead

266
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
A man who

267
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Swore I would never

268
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
I lived

269
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Renzi's

270
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
You never speak to Randy credico again

271
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,359
This is a piece of the story that almost every single report that I've seen fails to discuss

272
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
This is important

273
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
This is a very big story

274
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
And every articles that I've read

275
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Has basically just said

276
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,343
Rodger Stone had a falling-out mobile

277
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
No one has pulled that thread or at least no one seemed

278
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,255
I'm sure somebody has most haven't seen that article

279
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Majorities articles

280
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Leave that question open and I am

281
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,007
The type of person is very curious I want understand why why the f*** did these two people who are deeply involved

282
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
He said situation about espionage

283
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
It all goes back to 2007

284
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
Note imagine that Randy was actually the one who didn't want to talk to Rodger

285
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,903
Back in 2007 Rodger was working for the New York State Senate Majority Leader

286
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Bruno

287
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
Who is probably most memorable for being Governor Eliot Spitzer

288
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,911
Political differences between a result of Bruno being suspected

289
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
The corruption

290
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
The track is travel records

291
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
In terms of expenses

292
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Flights

293
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,223
Ultimately this was a misuse of State resources and Bruno's cleared of wrongdoing in terms of his traveling

294
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,135
In 2009 he was convicted on two counts of what is honest Services fraud

295
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,439
Failed to disclose conflicts of interest

296
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
Involving

297
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
$440,000 in Consulting fees

298
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
From a businessman he was friends with

299
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Which were alleged to be bribed

300
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,031
He was sentenced to two years in prison but his legal problems were solved by a deus ex machina

301
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
When the Supreme Court ruled in 2010

302
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
It honest Services fraud statute

303
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
The statute regarding

304
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
And that's his convictions were overturned

305
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Any walks for

306
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,879
Legally speaking Bruno is plain but I refuse to accept the $440,000

307
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,695
From a friend who is businessman

308
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
16

309
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
That would be like

310
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Let er Rip

311
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,567
Either way Rodger work for Joseph Bruno the time breaking in a salary of $20,000

312
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,895
And Eliot Spitzer was breathing down his bosses in it

313
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,271
F****** New York State politics man it is a wreck

314
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,207
Breathing

315
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
Rodger Stone went to work trying and succeeding in taking down Elliott

316
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
First he sent the FBI letter on November 19th

317
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
2007

318
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,471
Tipping them off about Spitzer's habit of employment

319
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
This to me seems like a flagrant Act of parkour

320
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,383
Rodger stone is a noted sexual Liberty and a libertarian

321
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,967
I thought you shouldn't be opposed to sex workers being a legal or punished

322
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
That's a Bedrock of principle

323
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Like in terms of libertarianism

324
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,183
I've heard him say before that he believes that button past it analyzed

325
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
Don't matter when you're at

326
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,095
He's a ratfuck of course that's what matters what do you think what you're doing is

327
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
Directly opposed

328
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
This wasn't the only thing that Rodger didn't is Attack on Eliot Spitzer

329
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
Previous destination to the FBI

330
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,919
At about 10 p.m. on August 6th called Eliot Spitzer's father Bernard

331
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
I proceeded to threaten legal action

332
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,295
Bernard Spitzer had nothing to do with Rogers political work

333
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
He called him out of pure ugliness and mallet

334
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
As we listen to this call this voicemail

335
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,791
Remember the call

336
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
Is Eliot Spitzer's eighty-three-year-old father

337
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
Who at the time was suffering from Parker

338
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Bernard

339
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
You will be

340
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Testified before the Senate

341
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Committee on investigate

342
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Campaign

343
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Send it

344
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Sergeant at Arms

345
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
You resisted

346
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Tina you will be rent

347
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Is it brought the Alban

348
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
It's not a god

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Your phony

350
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Psycho

351
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
You got it

352
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Folding lounger back

353
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Ketchup

354
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
You will be

355
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Fruit

356
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
The fact that you're trying to pass

357
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Illogical liar

358
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Sarpinos

359
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,919
Their number of flourishes in the vocal pattern

360
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
F****** Rodger to

361
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,039
I wrote that script

362
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
Flip the script in the aftermath of this called being released Bruno ask Rodger to Steph which Rodger agreed to

363
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
Proceeded to tell anyone who is this

364
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
First Rodger said flatly that he makes

365
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
The call

366
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
It wasn't me

367
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
He was Shaggy in it

368
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Weather

369
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,871
Up up

370
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Showed evidence

371
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Call Rogers Park

372
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
With information on the table Rodger

373
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,183
Anyone could have broken into his apartment and made the call but also no concern about his apartment being broken into

374
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,279
He claimed that he was at a live performance of frost Nixon that nights

375
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,375
Governor Spitzer

376
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
It shows you what Hubris in lying

377
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:57,311
New York Magazine

378
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711
On August 6th to him

379
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Old man lying in Huber

380
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,231
Oh my God demonstrated his own actions is amazing

381
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Crazy is a nut

382
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,375
Nowhere to turn

383
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
For no reason left a threatening message

384
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
Like leaving a threatening message on an old man's phone

385
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
That's not the kind of dirty trickster image

386
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Do you like 2% of self is B

387
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
Brilliant kind of guy

388
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Doing those sorts of stunts

389
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,551
Not be pointless Petty and just abusive for the sake of being abusive store

390
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,951
That's the ladder yourself publicly

391
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
As the as the prior

392
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
Because you need that

393
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
You need that

394
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
It's exactly what you've always responded to the Loki trickster God

395
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,567
A monster he's a horrible person who's made almost all of his money throughout his career

396
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
If you look like

397
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
Manafort Stone and black

398
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
Who they worked for

399
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
It is a who's who who dated work with a lot of murderous

400
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Dictators

401
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
In their in their rank

402
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
I know you look at the three of them

403
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
And then that water got involved with the f****** Willie Horton

404
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
Add

405
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
Slimy

406
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Comical bad person that he likes

407
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Resent because it is

408
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
It's easier for him to do his business

409
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
I feel like as far as

410
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Representing

411
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
That's just

412
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
More like knowing people

413
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Because

414
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
You is like

415
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
The job is open

416
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
You have to have

417
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
0 morality in order

418
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Tijera

419
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
People are clamoring

420
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
But the money is Big Nicholas

421
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Psycho

422
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
From his great hit

423
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
Mobutu Seko

424
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Zaire

425
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,344
Oh boy

426
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
Quote presided over the worst human-rights conditions in a

427
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,512
Bouquet

428
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Publican

429
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Terrorized

430
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,144
Beveled at least 5 billion dollars

431
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,448
From his own country

432
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Rogers

433
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
I meant of course another one it is

434
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
His great clients

435
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Yeah

436
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
What sort of business is involved

437
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Rigid lights

438
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
Define how's it going to get away with this one

439
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
With no other options

440
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
Rodger Stone blamed Randy credico

441
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
The Washington Post relates Rogers rationale

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
You've been on Letterman

443
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
He doesn't incredible

444
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
So his argument

445
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Now as I understand

446
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
Broke into his apartment

447
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Call to Bernard

448
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Perfect

449
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:39,776
Right under the auspices of the people trying to

450
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
To be at this point for Rogers version of Troy

451
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Right

452
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,992
So he goes on to say the credit goes done an impression of him in the past

453
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
That's Rodger Style

454
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
You always include a personal attack

455
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
They've somehow meant to invalidate the person

456
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
You could be

457
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Avoid that refutes your point

458
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Yeah

459
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,192
It's it's very consistent throughout his career

460
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,800
You hear it over and over again his appearances on Infowars even the way he attacked

461
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
People who could provide criticism

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
So funny

463
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
That's hilarious

464
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
I'm absolutely denying

465
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Years

466
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:31,232
In order for Rodger story to work as you pointed out Pro Spencer force does it have two enlisted credico

467
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Credit Karma

468
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,984
Is Rodger to lie about his alibi

469
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,544
Rodger

470
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
He blamed Randy credico

471
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
And this is why Rodger

472
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
I thought they would never see

473
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Speak again

474
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
There's a good chance

475
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
But they wouldn't

476
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
But they did

477
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Because in 2016 Rodger once again

478
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Patsy

479
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
That's important

480
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
On September 3rd 2016

481
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Rogers involvement

482
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Communicating with a song

483
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Was already well underway

484
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
According to Rogers indictment by June or July 26

485
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,080
Campaign officials

486
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
I'm not entirely sure if that's confirmed

487
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,552
Cuz there's multiple references to Trump officials not specified

488
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Same Pride person

489
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
They're not saying person

490
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Campaign official

491
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,584
So it's unclear being able to track whether it's all the same

492
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
So you've already telling

493
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,544
Wikileaks documents about Hillary

494
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,384
On June 22nd Wikileaks released the DNC emails

495
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
And 3 Days Later Rodger email Jerome corsi and told him to quote Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy

496
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
And get the pending email

497
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,672
Course he forwarded the email that Rodger had sent him to Ted Malik

498
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,536
Doing seeing pop up a time or two on Infowars in the past

499
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,400
He's famous for the Declaration yeah he might as well be called Ted Molokai

500
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
He's a bit of a fraud himself week we've gone over him

501
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,544
He's not really all that important

502
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
He's not named in this

503
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
He's not like a person one two or three

504
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Either the document

505
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
He's not a Target

506
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Maybe he's cooperating

507
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
So

508
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
Command is delivered to Coursey doesn't imply this is an unreasonable thing

509
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
He doesn't tell him to try to get to a saint

510
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Get in touch with them

511
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,896
By August 2nd 2016 emailing Rodger with suggestion

512
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
The next right-wing coordinated attack on Hillary was going

513
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:06,112
Quotes would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old memory bad has stroke

514
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,232
Percy also told Rodger that he expected next batch of emails that have to do with the Clinton Foundation

515
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,840
Almost immediately Rodger began telling everyone that he's spoken to us

516
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,656
And the next documents would likely be about the foundation

517
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
Almost as if he was repeating Annabella showing the things course he told him

518
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
Rodger we continue claiming that he had spoken with WikiLeaks

519
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,664
Until Wikileaks put out a statement in mid August 2nd not communicated with him

520
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,504
So his story changed to have him having talked to them

521
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,600
On August 23rd 2016 Rodger was a guest on Randy

522
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Criticos radio show

523
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,488
Echo ask Rodger about how Rodger

524
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
In that interview Rodger told Randy credico quote

525
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
We meeting him and Assange

526
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Mutual friend someone we both Trust

527
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
And therefore I'm a recipient of

528
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
A pretty good information

529
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
The date of this interview is important

530
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Because it predates Randy credico ever speaking

531
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Julian Assange

532
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
The first time that you were in contact with 12 sides with a guest on cryptos radio show

533
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,856
Rogers Communication through intermediaries or not

534
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Predates the possibility

535
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Credit

536
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Jerome corsi with the person who's coordinating with Rodger on

537
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
Misprint blame course

538
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
The connector

539
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
It's under the bus

540
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Too many questions

541
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Kernel of an idea that Rodger

542
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,688
Credico

543
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Accorsi was

544
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
This is why would Rodger testified in front of the house intelligence

545
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:47,232
He said his intermediary with credit and never brought up Jerome corsi

546
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Because he needed that to be the perception

547
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,144
By November 2017

548
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
We claim the credit go with his gobert

549
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
And unsurprisingly credico got a request from the house complete

550
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Come testify

551
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,896
He texted Rodger about it and Rodger replied with a quote from Richard Nixon

552
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Quote Stonewall

553
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,736
Plead the fifth anything to save the plan

554
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,576
This is a paraphrasing over

555
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
This is a former Attorney General on March 20th

556
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Second Life

557
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
273

558
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Approximately 11 months

559
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
For he would be formally impeached

560
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,936
Much like Nixon Rodger was stupid enough to say something like that

561
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
In a manner that would be

562
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Record it

563
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
On November 28th 2017 credico was subpoenaed by the committee

564
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
And he told Rodger about it

565
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Rodger

566
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552
Is later he would run Jerome corsi and ask him to start writing so articles

567
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
About credit card

568
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
Rodger sent but is Patsy wasn't cooperating

569
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
So he planned

570
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
Republic scapegoating

571
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
But he was going to

572
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
Initiate that plan

573
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,584
Corsi reply to his request by saying quote

574
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Why not wait to see what he does

575
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
You might be defending yourself too much

576
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,728
Raising new questions that will fuel new inquiry

577
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
This may be a time to say less not more

578
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,896
Corsi the wisest person in this store

579
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
Because he's so boring a douche I think that we

580
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:16,576
Maybe underestimate how like involved in Shazam

581
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
So his go-between

582
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
How is course

583
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Incontact

584
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
He might also be making all that up

585
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
I don't know but also could be through

586
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Garage door

587
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
New London

588
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,544
I mean until we know more

589
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Think that

590
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Rodger

591
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
Is lying to cover this up

592
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
I don't know what course he's game

593
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,600
He could be making all of it up himself and funneling it to Rodger Rodger thinks it's coming

594
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Massage

595
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
4

596
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
Course he could actually be in touch with a dog

597
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,280
Subway

598
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
It it becomes

599
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Huge disaster for him

600
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
If corsi's in

601
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
So

602
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
Is after 10

603
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Nixon

604
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Quote

605
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
2 days later on November 30th

606
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
He reaches out to Jerome corsi and tells him to start writing about credit

607
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,752
On November 30th 2017 Rodger Stone released

608
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
On the website

609
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
Where he exposed

610
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Randy credico

611
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
There's no byline on the story may or may not have written it

612
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Either way the editorial Tone It Infowars flowery towards credico for long and behind-the-scenes

613
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,536
Manipulation

614
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Strategy

615
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
Rodger seppi's complimentary things 42

616
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
In his statement about credit

617
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
To going along with him and his

618
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
We the fifth plan

619
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Credit Karma

620
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
It's mostly it's a public statement on the website but it's also a message

621
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,600
Should you directly to the website

622
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Use the compliments later to inflict

623
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Further guilt

624
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,120
Emailing him everything I said publicly about you has been complimentary yet you continue to act like nunberg

625
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:43,520
Referencing Sam nunberg the guy who got drunk all over TV

626
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
So the next day after that article

627
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,224
December 1st Rodger Texan Credit Co and told him to do a Frank pentangeli

628
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Referencing the character in Godfather

629
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
But also knows what the compression

630
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Committee wants to

631
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
No

632
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
This is a really damning referee

633
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,744
The jelly was setup by Corleone

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
I was being threatened into not testifying

635
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,656
Also Frank does testified then recant after he's been threatened

636
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
He's threatened his family will be safe

637
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
So he does

638
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:22,432
I don't know about credico but I would not be quick to do a Frank had someone who like

639
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Obviously

640
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
Like I committed a crime

641
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,464
Please help me cover

642
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
You bet

643
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,984
What an idiot Randy credico replies Rodger that Rodger needs to amend his testimony before

644
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
For December 50

645
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
The day he was scheduled to testify

646
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
I was doing this because by this point

647
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
You figured out that you couldn't be Rogers gobert

648
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
Considering

649
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,760
Massage when Rodger was going around immediate early August

650
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
Claiming that he communicated with Wiki Lee

651
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
He knew that his testimony would contradict Rogers

652
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
And was extending a very unnecessary Curtis

653
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,280
It's unclear what happened between December 1st and December 12th

654
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,632
Put on the 12 critico told the committee that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right

655
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
If you was forced to testify

656
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,496
Based on information is public I can't say what happened there

657
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
But it's really hard not to

658
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,408
Indictment doesn't include any interactions between those dates

659
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Is very telling

660
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,528
I know legal scholar but I'm positive that Mueller has those interactions

661
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
You can make your own

662
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600
Conclusions about why they're not at me

663
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
Kill you

664
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
I will kill you

665
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,048
Rogers emailing with Trump

666
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
Ministration of campaign

667
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,728
You have any news about a wikileak

668
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
And he says yes let's go on WhatsApp

669
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,128
Time

670
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,528
That time Rodger was communicating with him

671
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
Encrypted

672
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,696
Horrible just over unprotected

673
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
So whatever whatever the case I'm not entirely sure what all the details are I think some of that will come out as time goes on

674
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
For now

675
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Vague threat

676
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
By the end of December credico

677
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,872
Thought

678
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,480
What time here is interesting because by that Point Fortin Rick Gates have been indicted

679
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
Michael Flynn to just plead guilty to cut it

680
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,440
If you're Randy credico you're seeing all these people going down mixed up with the guy who knows all of them

681
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Got to feel weird

682
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,048
You're being vaguely threatened by the guy who knows all of them

683
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
And you know the guy who

684
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,936
Who knows all that was also one of their lobbying partners

685
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
That would not be a pleasant position

686
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616
Now

687
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
I don't want to I don't want to see I don't want

688
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,040
Who am I

689
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Is it the guy who I know is guilty

690
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Because he texts

691
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Guilty

692
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Or

693
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
Who is

694
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
Proving that a bunch of other people are guilty

695
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:25,984
So critical told Rodger that he wasn't going to let Rogers wise about him

696
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,080
Began making video appearances to clear his name and tell his side of the story

697
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,224
Turn on April 9th 2018 Rodger email credit go to tell him

698
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
He also threatened

699
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,552
Mu

700
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
Just probably records The Killing

701
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Dog

702
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,720
That's my dog you're holding onto and then

703
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:52,352
I'm so ready Let's Get It On prepared c*********

704
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Right back

705
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:02,336
Humor is all over again

706
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,480
Which is a week tonight

707
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,088
Most probably being in there I'm not

708
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
I don't I'm not interested somebody broke into my apartment

709
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,768
Medrite they sent an email Friday to email to self

710
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,632
And perhaps my favorite part of the story when mother emailed back in May

711
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
They reached out for comment from Rodger

712
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Paragraphs

713
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Pure f******

714
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Can gold

715
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,872
In a text message to Mother Jones

716
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
Credico

717
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Stop making a threat

718
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,760
It contends the critical reciting his words out of context

719
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
He told me he had terminal prostate cancer Stone rights it was such a response to that we talked about it to do was pick 4

720
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
Credico says

721
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,600
Chicken Rogers is being like real tuck in Macon

722
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Everything up

723
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,816
Rogers trying to threaten credit

724
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Completing the stamp

725
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Because you knew that if credico Rodger testimony was going to be contradicted

726
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
No contradictions

727
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,384
Timeline would fall apart in Jerome corsi would come into play something Rodger never wanted to happen

728
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,480
The cover-up corsi's involvement in all this

729
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
Interpretation to make sure those lies weren't realize

730
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Turn the charging document

731
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
He's dead to right on there it's

732
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
A open and shut case

733
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,768
The Chrome

734
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Plated

735
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
But here's the important thing to realize why I told you this long-ass story

736
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,008
Compulsive behaviors naturally Trend towards forming a pattern

737
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,360
Serial killer start to develop routine behaviors and habitual Liars due to

738
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
Given the information present it would be a stretch

739
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Me to say that Rodger stone is guilty of deeper involvement

740
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
The DMC in

741
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
But the dissemination bacterial

742
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,160
But his behavior deeply suggest to me that he is

743
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,256
Is a response to early suggestions that he was involved in any of this stuff

744
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
Exact path that his denials of being the one who harassed Eliot Spitzer

745
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
First step tonight expressively

746
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
Live Match

747
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
3rd step keep lying until people don't believe you anymore

748
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
4th step blame Brandy

749
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Be credico

750
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
If you take out of the equation this is also the exact pattern that Rodger followed when he was forced to step down from a position in the night

751
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,440
Africans accused of posting classified ad looking for people to swing with him and his wife

752
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Deny lie

753
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Keep lying

754
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Blame someone else

755
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
An unnamed domestic

756
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,864
Employee you said had a drug problem

757
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
Just like you did with credit go in 2017

758
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,240
We all learn from our experiences as human

759
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,824
I generally speaking repeat successful Behavior

760
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:18,432
In the case of the 2016 campaign and propaganda campaign surrounding it

761
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,248
Rodger replayed them out of trouble

762
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,112
In 1996 2007 and undoubtedly a ton of other time that we're not aware of

763
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,952
In this case though it seems like the underlying crime was too big

764
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
Where is Patsy just to laugh it off

765
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Right

766
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
That is kind of what I feel about the endive

767
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,728
What is that

768
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
What does in rapture

769
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
With your with your room storyteller

770
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
People are making

771
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
And some of it has to do with

772
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
I don't know

773
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Lack of awareness

774
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Curiosity perhaps in some reporting

775
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
And then some of it is

776
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Is just like

777
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
I understand that I'm

778
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Connect

779
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,024
Maybe can't be proven

780
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Leave there

781
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,608
You know the patterns of behavior are definitely there

782
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,216
If you walked me into a quart I probably couldn't make this argument right illegal

783
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
Inspection

784
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
But in terms of how I

785
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Look what's the most likely scenario

786
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,408
I feel very confident

787
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
That this is

788
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
And that's not to say that Rodger absolutely was

789
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
In touch with

790
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
Russian intelligence or anything like that

791
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,464
The way he acted when he started coming up

792
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
That he believes he might have

793
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
Right that's the I think that's as far as I'm willing

794
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
These guys

795
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
I have got to

796
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
They finally have to realize the worst thing that

797
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
To them with Trump winning

798
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
The presidential

799
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
Nobody

800
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
They were just like phuc yea

801
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Show off my

802
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Play skills

803
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
And then use the use that

804
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
Showing off

805
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Spell those

806
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,463
To somebody else feels like the classic like

807
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Builder

808
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
In order to Parlay

809
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
That's what they were real

810
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,079
Italy Italy to tons

811
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Contract

812
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Yeah so I don't

813
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,391
I don't know I think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out

814
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,695
Your articles are starting to come out about Rodger

815
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Same like

816
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Look

817
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,327
I know something I'll talk to mother

818
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
It's already indications that he's like

819
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Get out of this

820
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
Pirate

821
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
I realize that I'm f*****

822
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,127
Alex

823
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Trump

824
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,759
A little extra because there's another important piece to

825
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:08,159
To consider and that is nothing in that indictment relies on credit or even

826
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
It is basically

827
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Hayirli made up

828
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Of these documents

829
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
The emails

830
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
The the

831
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
And stuff like that

832
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,447
If there's no like you said he said about this

833
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
It's entirely like

834
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
We can show

835
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,847
Is this you guys were having this conversation

836
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Your testimony

837
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
Contradict

838
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Therefore

839
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
You lied to Congress

840
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,575
Hawaiian stuff I know exactly

841
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
It it it's telling I'm sure Rodger lied about more stuff

842
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,487
In his testimony

843
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Fetzer

844
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
To cover up corsi's

845
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Involved

846
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,655
I think that you can probably end up

847
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Plead is public case

848
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,335
That I just didn't remember or whatever

849
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
The witness intimidation

850
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
That is a hundred percent

851
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
Borne out by those

852
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Equal standard

853
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
And

854
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Like

855
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Aisha

856
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
If he doesn't cut a deal like I don't I can't imagine

857
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,071
The way he's carried himself throughout this entire like less

858
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Two-and-a-half years or so

859
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:27,007
Yelling about Miller everyday on the radio saying that he's guilty

860
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,567
Reason people would show

861
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,687
They were at least he wasn't

862
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Being an a******

863
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
While they were investigating

864
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Stone is

865
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
Everybody

866
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
I hate them

867
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
Extend the only reason that

868
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Would get off

869
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
If Trump

870
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Pardon

871
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
And the only reason

872
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
Is if he knew that right

873
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Rodger Stone

874
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
And the only reason that

875
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,031
I know that we kind of have

876
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Slightly

877
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
Feelings about whether or not

878
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Pardon

879
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Rodger

880
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Everything is up for grabs nowadays

881
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
If you were to do that it would be

882
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Definitely

883
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Obstruction of justice

884
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Oh yeah

885
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Twitter

886
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
This would be like

887
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Directly

888
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
Pardoning someone who tried

889
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
To derail and investigate

890
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
I don't know

891
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
And nobody would care

892
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
Because the right-wing is like

893
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
Guess what we're going to survive this

894
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
We've we've survived

895
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
So much in the past

896
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,975
2 years it is Non-Stop

897
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,999
All of the elite

898
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,911
Enough for us to not get away with

899
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
We got the indictment stuff

900
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
I think we were pretty

901
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,151
Decent on what's going on with that where

902
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,991
That comes from and all that stuff

903
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
January

904
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
25th

905
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
Alex is immediate response

906
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
2

907
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
His best buddy

908
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
The guy tells him every

909
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
Narrative

910
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,999
Rodger Stone

911
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
Hear it

912
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Have you ever

913
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
I just never told

914
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
11

915
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
11 is time

916
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Rodger got arrested

917
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
Its 6 or so a few hours

918
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Assuming he was awake I've no idea

919
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,159
Harrison Smith

920
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Underling

921
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Infowars

922
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,631
He's the guy who found those antifa Soros documents on 4chan to make a big deal out of it

923
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,239
Brilliant researcher terrible on air 280

924
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,591
Heart attack

925
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:16,735
For a while

926
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
It was

927
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
Like I watched it

928
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Wow

929
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,391
How is Alex not bum-rushed

930
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
The studio

931
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
We are in a crisis

932
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
Stop

933
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Anything

934
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:36,959
Eddie told Joe Biggs backend broken through the wall like

935
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,407
Yeah I mean it just goes to show how shallow his

936
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,015
End of the day when you f****** spin artist in there

937
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
You got Harrison Smith

938
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,463
Good luck ironically the only person who should have been in there that wasn't Alex is Rochester

939
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,791
I like to Harrison Tomatoes trying to come

940
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
Compare the treatment of

941
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
Rodger

942
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,007
Two likes Olsen eaten in

943
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,567
Teleprompter

944
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,895
He tries to stay the gulag archipelago

945
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,735
Trips over the word

946
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,855
It's clear that he has no idea what the words are as reading

947
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Embarrassing

948
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
It's so bad

949
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
And so I was

950
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Expecting like Alex

951
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
You got to right the ship

952
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
His own broadcast like

953
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,983
Harrison Smith

954
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
Performance somewhat

955
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,551
The level of talent is so glaring

956
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,855
That guy is a showstopper

957
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:02,463
I give it two days before they start comparing Rodger to Martin Luther King

958
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
The letters from the Birmingham Jail

959
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
Start the show

960
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,727
And like I said

961
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
Kind of subdued

962
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
There's a little bit of like a

963
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
Almost focused energy

964
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
A little bit

965
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
It doesn't last

966
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,711
Start

967
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Pneumonia

968
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
Kiel Alex's whole things

969
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
At the beginning of the show

970
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
I think he's aware

971
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
How many f******

972
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:36,767
Can people are going to tune in to his show to see what the f*** freaked out that

973
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,583
Excessive traffic coming to his website

974
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
And so all he wants to do

975
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
Is make sure that everybody knows

976
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
He's about to talk to Rodger Stone was just gotten out of jail on bail

977
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,567
Exclusive

978
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
And he's Furious

979
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
That more media Outlets aren't saying

980
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,039
Infowars has the exclusive to start off this year

981
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,135

982

Your cat

989
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Saying that

990
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,551
Rodger Stone

991
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,111
Tamara

992
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:40,255
He said I can just feel it I can see it all all the preparation everything and he sent me a text message saying

993
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,935
Rodger Stone exclusively this is the first interview

994
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
Stop now.

995
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,919
You got the

996
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Morning Show

997
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Great we start

998
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
Not into this interview

999
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
He is he's not Rodger Stone

1000
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,959
The character that we've come to know

1001
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,335
Calling Adam Schiff a c*********

1002
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
Screaming about how everybody

1003
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,247
I think reality has set in and lying is not so fun for him anymore

1004
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Because

1005
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,927
He has consequences in front of him used to that what he's really not used to is being handcuffed

1006
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
To his hand and

1007
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,631
Into a courtroom a little bit later

1008
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:56,543
Change little bit of how you're going to do business real real quick

1009
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,871
World exclusive

1010
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,711
And

1011
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,527
Spoiler alert this is almost exactly the same

1012
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,647
Ends up going out in front of the courthouse

1013
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
That is out there

1014
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
They're so cute

1015
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Alex's

1016
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Exclusive

1017
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
Where should we start with how you were able to predict this last night of the phone what happened this morning

1018
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
Your house

1019
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
I want to dress this really

1020
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,895
He predicted this is not that surprising

1021
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:38,015
Recently mother requested his testimony from the house

1022
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
He knew he'd lied

1023
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,695
If the investigator is requesting those documents that means

1024
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Did they have reason to believe

1025
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,047
This will provide

1026
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
So him being like they're coming

1027
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,423
Of course they're coming Rodger

1028
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Predicted

1029
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,519
Pre-dawn raid

1030
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
What time does

1031
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
Pacification for the

1032
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Make it to my

1033
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,039
Play One More Day

1034
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,879
Once you were in jail then what unfolded after that

1035
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,631
Charges relate to Russian collusion

1036
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
And I actually think

1037
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,567
That's worse for Rodger was like

1038
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Collusion at all

1039
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
Which means they're charged

1040
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
Pink stone with some

1041
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
In order to make

1042
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,223
Conviction

1043
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
Which means when they do charge somebody with

1044
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
They've got that

1045
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Conviction

1046
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
Already there

1047
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
So they can use

1048
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Possible

1049
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:54,047
My feeling about it

1050
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
Conspicuous

1051
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,911
Yeah and not

1052
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,703
It has nothing to do with this

1053
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,263
But he does just on a secondary level

1054
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
So anyway

1055
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,639
Or any other illegal act

1056
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
2016 election

1057
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,879
Prepare to die

1058
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
That's not true

1059
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,543
Unintentional

1060
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
You don't accidentally

1061
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:44,223
Just forget the person that was actually Jerome corsi

1062
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,271
And I'm going to uniform

1063
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,575
Jerome corsi out of this whole thing

1064
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:53,439
I don't know I understand he probably thinks of his defenses going to work

1065
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
But I

1066
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
As an external Observer

1067
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
I think it's

1068
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:03,423
Yeah this is very Hollow when you start your interview with what essentially amounts

1069
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,751
Haha

1070
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Bad day

1071
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,919
You might have been able to tell In that clip their Rogers having a little bit of phony

1072
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,479
He's having some troubles with technology

1073
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,623
Please describe what happened because your phone's breaking up with you said 29

1074
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,975
29 FBI agents

1075
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,191
Automatic weapons

1076
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Sure

1077
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,359
17 vehicles in the Jean

1078
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,687
They terrorized my wife and my dog

1079
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
2 mi

1080
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:12,287
Do you notice I was just describing what I like

1081
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
The result of his actions

1082
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Coincidence

1083
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
Depriving is exactly

1084
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
People with guns

1085
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Of course

1086
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
Bunch cars

1087
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
Of course this is a high-profile Target

1088
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Who is involved

1089
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,719
Something pretty messy

1090
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:37,119
Not that you would expect a shootout to happen or anything like that

1091
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,191
That's cuz you're like

1092
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Is easy

1093
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
If he gets anywhere near that fireplace

1094
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Going to spin around

1095
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:48,895
To be outside you can be able to write

1096
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,175
They searched my house

1097
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,991
Yes is reasonable suspicion

1098
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,807
Further Evidence Fair

1099
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
So like the other stuff is like

1100
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
He is involved with an outlet that

1101
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
Routinely

1102
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,607
Demonizes black use their killed by police snow like I don't care

1103
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
The next

1104
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
Alex

1105
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
But you're not black

1106
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
It's

1107
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,823
Roger's coming from is

1108
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,991
Do you know who I am there's that sort of feel to it

1109
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Whatever

1110
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
If it's necklet what we hear is

1111
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Is that

1112
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,671
Alex

1113
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,951
Rogers Prescott

1114
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
Talk about how awesome

1115
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
But you still only

1116
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
You got to talk to him before the press conference

1117
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,727
Ladies and gentlemen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reporters

1118
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,711
Exclusively Global explosion

1119
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,695
He goes on to later say it's bigger than OJ's press conference

1120
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,255
A couple points on neck

1121
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:13,631
Official event and it was indoors in a small Ballroom

1122
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
Of course there's more people outside

1123
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
The Florida courthouse

1124
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,823
Where do torious process

1125
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
Of course in Florida I would drive a couple hours

1126
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
Great

1127
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
So I can only imagine the tons of people like hell yeah

1128
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
I like is actually like

1129
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Most of them think this is newsworthy or

1130
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Bigger than o.j.

1131
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,887
Just from a standpoint

1132
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
Treasure

1133
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,495
Something that I would like on my phone video of him

1134
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,823
With shackles on like I would watch that anytime

1135
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Sad-eyed watch that be like

1136
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
We got him

1137
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Something gratifying

1138
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
About that when I woke up

1139
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
This news is broken

1140
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,855
It was a tragedy

1141
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,183
I've been in the middle of trying to work on a very in-depth

1142
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,511
Wednesday episode 4

1143
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
I was getting it already

1144
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
University

1145
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,191
Now you throwing me off course I got to do this Rogers Township

1146
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Life progresses at its own pace and

1147
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Follow it

1148
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,151
Exclusive

1149
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,223
He's putting off all those people out there to talk to us

1150
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
Cuz we're amazing

1151
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,599
And here Rodger just gives him what I would describe as a defense

1152
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
And I don't believe

1153
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
Play cheats for statements to the car

1154
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:55,007
Maria

1155
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,831
Today

1156
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
Because

1157
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
The go-between

1158
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,127
This is this is journalism

1159
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
Only if you're bluffing

1160
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
About what the

1161
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,551
Dightman's actually says

1162
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
Alex's

1163
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
But

1164
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
This indicates to me that this is the direction

1165
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,023
Rodger trying to go with his defense

1166
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,071
And I think it's not the right

1167
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,911
I don't know what the right defense it's not my responsibility

1168
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
Come up with it

1169
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:59,263
Is very soft

1170
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
Here's my pic

1171
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,127
Leave a voicemail on

1172
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Every senators

1173
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,759
I think that's not a bad idea

1174
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,575
Kill the dogs

1175
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
Beginning of something

1176
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,535
At Alex's

1177
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
In the entire world

1178
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,375
To believe that he

1179
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Concerned about his own well-being

1180
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,239
Is the aftermath of Rodger getting indicted

1181
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
Not just his own well-being

1182
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
One of his family members

1183
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,967
Uno

1184
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
Washington Post

1185
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,647
When does the special counsel

1186
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,495
Cuz I wanted to work here

1187
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,111
Fathers

1188
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
Give me support

1189
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,303
They know we got elected

1190
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,119
Little bit of Huber's there too

1191
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,935
I don't play I haven't found it I can't find any

1192
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Like legitimate

1193
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Sources talking about how

1194
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
David Jones

1195
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Is going down

1196
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
The

1197
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:43,711
Hrh Infowars

1198
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Is getting together and then

1199
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Amlo has to be like Caravan of white people coming to the Border we're going to have to build

1200
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:59,583
It's interesting here because this is one narrative that I'm not going to be able to release

1201
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,143
Fully tell you what's going on

1202
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,935
But

1203
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Article

1204
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
About course

1205
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
View payments

1206
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,943
And we'll see I think this is a story that's going to develop a little bit over time

1207
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,503
Especially contract

1208
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
I don't think there's actually a really

1209
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
Reasonable argument

1210
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
He made that went course he went

1211
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
Deep down the qanon hole

1212
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,839
I would fire tattoo I don't know there's a d

1213
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
You just got

1214
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,727
Ani and Alex did fire him

1215
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,567
There's a chance that Rodger and corsi we're both pulling the wool over Alex's eyes

1216
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
In terms of their

1217
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,895
Clearly documented

1218
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
Interaction

1219
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,807
So really really

1220
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
Interesting

1221
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Especially in the context

1222
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
Alex

1223
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,951
He told Rodger Stone

1224
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Go get me Wiki

1225
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
Glen Rogers

1226
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:09,215
We've got recalled

1227
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,823
S*** from this Greenwich time article

1228
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,103
Corsi perhaps

1229
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,967
Best known for promoting the false idea that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States

1230
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,271
Has released internal special counsel.

1231
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
Alleged deal offers and published

1232
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
Outlining his account of interactions

1233
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
With his one-time Ally

1234
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,023
The longtime Trump advisor Rodger Stone

1235
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,815
Subject of intense scrutiny

1236
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
In the Mueller probe

1237
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,751
Is $15,000 a month in payments from Infowars

1238
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,823
Special counsel investigation

1239
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
As a deep state

1240
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,895
Proceed to sign to topple President Trump

1241
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
Infowars

1242
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
Confirm that these payments

1243
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Continue for the past 6 months

1244
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
Hi severance

1245
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
Sincerity lost lost

1246
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
As the websites Washington bureau chief

1247
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
A job that stone helped arrange

1248
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,207
According to both Stone and Coursey

1249
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:06,303
The revelation of courses arrangement

1250
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,839
Afraid relationship

1251
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
Between course again Stone

1252
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
And how the on-again-off-again light

1253
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,959
America's foremost

1254
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Conspiracy theorist

1255
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,775
Has drawn the attention of mothers invest

1256
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
When we talk about

1257
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,383
Alex

1258
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,247
Bureau

1259
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,575
Like the whole thing with stone saying we need to have him

1260
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:35,231
Or maybe Alex. We need to get a present in Washington and Coursey was the one stone recommended instead of

1261
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
For the job

1262
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:42,399
Also interesting so much money

1263
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,703
That's so much money

1264
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,543
Journalist get paid like a dollar every week

1265
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,591
Yeah I know yeah

1266
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
Over 100,000

1267
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,479
150000

1268
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,855
Course he would have been pulling in just from Infowars anyone on nonsense

1269
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
He's f******

1270
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,559
Cannot keep it on the Shelf

1271
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,887
Got a copy Mike cernovich

1272
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
It was free

1273
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,239
I got

1274
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
Incase

1275
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
If they call something later

1276
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
I'll let you know

1277
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,551
Percy said in an interview that he doesn't remember being asked by Mueller's investigators about those payments

1278
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,415
After 40 hours of questioning over several days

1279
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Forgotten

1280
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,975
Quote it's pretty far-fetched course

1281
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
C7osure

1282
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
Quiet

1283
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
I'm the guy was talk to the most I have been hushed

1284
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
About anything

1285
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
So

1286
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,519
Last week from Alex Jones

1287
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
Does father

1288
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
That the payments would stop

1289
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
According to a legal complaint

1290
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Defiled this week

1291
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
So

1292
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
It's unclear whether or not

1293
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,367
He was fired in June

1294
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,183
And paid the remainder of a one-year contract to end of this month

1295
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,999
Is Infowars paid already been scheduled to end

1296
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
This month

1297
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
Infowars

1298
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Ernie Mark run.

1299
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,935
So it's unclear I could believe either version of the story quite frankly

1300
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:25,311
I know the course he's up to some s*** but that doesn't prove much money right

1301
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Be a situation where it's like

1302
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
F*** it.

1303
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Raking it in

1304
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,271
Is this past couple of years for him

1305
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
I must he must have bought

1306
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
Six boats out of all the bulshit

1307
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,207
I know I wish I was representing

1308
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:48,607
Quote stonecore seeing Alex Jones all said that the

1309
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,935
Received after leaving or not related to corsi's role in the mall

1310
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Pro

1311
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,543
Whining about being broke down

1312
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,359
Course he declined to comment on Stones character

1313
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Position of his Finance

1314
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
So

1315
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,967
You know it's faces

1316
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
Reels back

1317
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Conforth

1318
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
Put a little away

1319
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
Put a little bit of

1320
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
That's just

1321
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
Now that's just good

1322
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
So it's

1323
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,047
Interesting to me cuz this article has

1324
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,607
Some stuff that I don't know

1325
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
If I was

1326
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Aware of

1327
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,983
Rodger

1328
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Corsi coming together

1329
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:34,175
I didn't realize this and I'm not sure if this is exactly true or if it's a public story but

1330
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,735
Here from this Greenwich time article

1331
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
Conspiracy theorist

1332
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,671
Conservative pose the question to him in 2011

1333
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Who's this guy Jerome corsi

1334
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:51,071
What's don't ask why you wanted to know about corsi Trump responded I've been talkin

1335
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,703
Corset recently published a book titled where's the birth certificate the case that Barack Obama is not eligible

1336
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
3 presidents

1337
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:02,591
Trump became the most public Ardent supporter of course he's a public appearances

1338
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,639
Obama to provide more proof

1339
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
That is burnt

1340
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,991
Goes on to say

1341
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,855
Corsi's relations

1342
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
Continued after Trump's Victor

1343
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
Don't suggest that they both go to work

1344
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
Infowars

1345
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,511
Of course he said in an interview

1346
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:26,911
Told the post the course he was one of 15 people to Stone recommended

1347
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
This possible

1348
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Of the new Washington Bureau for the

1349
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Seaside

1350
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
So

1351
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:37,919
Like I said I don't know

1352
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,783
Interesting glimpses into like the version of the story that people are presenting but I can't

1353
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
The truth out about this

1354
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
I don't know what those paint

1355
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
That's word to Coursey

1356
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
I can't claim to

1357
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,487
It's an interesting thing that I think will develop as the two of them start

1358
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:56,607
S******* all over each other and that course he's indicated that he's willing to work with the probe

1359
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:00,703
Mueller probe this could get really ugly we might learn a lot more in the

1360
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,775
Future

1361
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
And everyone's a liar

1362
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
So for now we have to put a pin in the

1363
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
Corsi payments Meredith

1364
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Although it is something I'm very

1365
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,759
So this is

1366
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,343
This is this is like a Tarantino

1367
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:22,719
Standoff like every one of them has a gun pointed at each other's had and they're both are all going to end up

1368
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
Political

1369
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,519
Text with Alex is still trying to do his world exclusive

1370
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Interviewed Rodger

1371
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
He throws it

1372
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,615
And then

1373
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
To the real world right now

1374
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,783
Your house

1375
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:55,487
Other moving in to your home looking for any obviously there's nothing

1376
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
What's unfolding

1377
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,591
Phone

1378
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,223
Yep my phone all the time

1379
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Going places and doing things

1380
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,927
Probably malware from all the poor and he's looking at

1381
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:31,327
Website

1382
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:37,727
Anyway nightmare

1383
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
S***

1384
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,615
She's not there

1385
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:50,271
This is the best you've ever done was got to kill some time now cuz Rodger that got to get him back on the phone

1386
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,575
Start complaining about his position in life

1387
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
Fan Drive

1388
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,671
He starts talking Finance

1389
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,719
Surprised by some of these number

1390
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Oh God

1391
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
BuzzFeed

1392
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,327
It's three hundred million dollars a year

1393
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,119
It doesn't have the traffic

1394
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
Infowars

1395
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
Network

1396
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,239
Are you f****** kidding those videos

1397
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
The videos about as real as it like 8.

1398
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:18,943
He million views does channels are massive

1399
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,967
People are owned by f******

1400
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
Evil Bratt

1401
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Motherfuker

1402
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:31,231
We shall $40 product but it's literally

1403
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
Show the match

1404
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
Gross $29

1405
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Gross 40

1406
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,215
Are all the crew pay all the services

1407
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:45,311
Literally

1408
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,967
That is a bad setup you are not doing things right

1409
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,367
Tim fruge

1410
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:04,767
I wouldn't cuz you could you could

1411
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,839
Who gives a s***

1412
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:14,239
I'm sure most of Mark Randazzo's work is it shouldn't take too long

1413
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
We could do could really be fit on a Post-It

1414
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:21,663
20 million after paying off the

1415
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Let's assume

1416
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:31,391
I mean rent we saw the studio not where it was

1417
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Boston

1418
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Even though it's a giant

1419
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
But yeah

1420
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,351
Six or seven Grand

1421
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,959
No problem

1422
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
An area of Austin

1423
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
How to be super hot

1424
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
It's not like in the middle of August

1425
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,455
So I think you could probably have a very reasonable but hi

1426
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Right

1427
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,783
Then you got to consider bandwidth

1428
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,831
Cuz he has his own servers and stuff like that

1429
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
That's probably a pretty serious

1430
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
To the tune of

1431
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
Maybe a couple hundred thousand a year

1432
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,047
Something like that if he does get the traffic that he

1433
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
Pretends he does

1434
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,119
Which will suit for this

1435
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:16,959
$15,000 a month

1436
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,287
Totally normal severance pay

1437
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:33,087
Of course

1438
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
There's a much more important piece of the operation

1439
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
You got it

1440
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:41,279
If he's that is a salary that is possible

1441
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,607
Like I'm sure he's not paying David Knight

1442
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
But like

1443
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,775
Become a considered a respectable two or three grand a month

1444
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
I do I bet it's more than that I will put in

1445
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
Category

1446
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Something like that

1447
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
Salary range for someone like course

1448
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
You got a like

1449
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:11,487
You got to cut down on some I hate someone who is a big supporter of workers

1450
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,535
I still think you're paying people to watch

1451
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,935
For what that's about

1452
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,519
Unless part of that is don't snitch on the game

1453
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Something like that like

1454
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
Is life

1455
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
Look it doesn't

1456
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
Me and that the payments after

1457
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,455
The fact of course he's fighting her husband

1458
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
But maybe all of it is like

1459
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
You know where up

1460
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
Here's a lot of money

1461
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,599
Yeah you don't get

1462
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:41,439
Complacent or feel negative about it I feel like maybe I'll

1463
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,207
Rytec

1464
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
Encrypted email somebody with arsenic

1465
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,607
I don't know if that's a possibility cuz of course he is not worth $15,000 a month

1466
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
You can put that on my grave

1467
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
Whatever I would

1468
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,847
Hear those numbers and be like

1469
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,407
I I can give up on my morals for a little while

1470
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,735
Just here I can

1471
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
Freelancer

1472
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
3 years

1473
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,599
I appreciate everyone who donates to our show

1474
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Tremendously

1475
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Concept

1476
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:17,535
$15,000

1477
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Absurd

1478
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,887
He's having phone problems again

1479
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
It's not great

1480
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
And maybe if we

1481
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
Catoctin Circle

1482
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,519
Describe Rogers

1483
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
You in almost

1484
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
In its entirety as being like

1485
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,383
He's channeling marionberry

1486
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
That's what I would say

1487
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
It works

1488
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,623
So Alex got Rodger back on the phone

1489
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
I need gears up to

1490
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,183
Just throw to him

1491
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,743
And this is a little bit of a longer clip but I think

1492
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
It's really important

1493
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,559
I think it's so indicative

1494
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,119
Of where Rodger Stone and Alex Jones's relationship

1495
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,167
He's going to be moving forward

1496
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
It also just made me laugh

1497
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
So f******

1498
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,431
You're fun to talk to you everyday your good friend

1499
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,087
My friend

1500
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,647
About again

1501
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
John Ray

1502
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,511
What she's going through

1503
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
They're moving in your house

1504
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:28,959
Squatter's rights

1505
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,615
There's no doubt they're going in

1506
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,943
All these phones are tapped

1507
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,039
Nope so you better believe they are so pissed right now

1508
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,855
Rodger there

1509
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
Reporter

1510
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
The show me people on the phones

1511
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
What's the chance of

1512
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:12,991
The most obvious thing happened

1513
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:17,855
Out today you can hear that his voice is almost gone he's he's he's been up all night long

1514
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,671
There was just one statement up on infowars.com

1515
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
Check the audio

1516
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
The video this right now

1517
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,535
Exclusive interview

1518
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
Immediately

1519
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,423
Infowars.com

1520
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Denise Lucifer statement

1521
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,287
Is it important

1522
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,639
Mueller Ezra prosecutor sent text message last night said they're setting

1523
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,735
Venetian wasn't

1524
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,599
Meme somebody made myself Faith goldy and Rodger

1525
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
The n word

1526
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,255
I think they're going to probably arrest me tomorrow

1527
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,327
Conversation

1528
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,887
I can just see it because there's all these puppies about

1529
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:07,263
How I've been treated bad Mascota mean for my testimony

1530
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,551
I was just driving me absolutely crazy

1531
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,879
Probably forgot the world is closer but he had a lot more to add

1532
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
Presidential

1533
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,511
Obviously I need to do

1534
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
You're not

1535
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,823
Southern Seas right now

1536
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:48,479
Again. And the cellphone to Grant Smith his lawyer cut out

1537
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,295
Rodger doing that

1538
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,767
Call fer landline

1539
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,815
Text Grant right now

1540
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
Okay

1541
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
See you notice what happened there

1542
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:22,272
Alex didn't know at all that Rodger had passed

1543
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
It was going out to speak

1544
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
To the reporters that crowd

1545
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
That was outside the courthouse

1546
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,304
World Champ I have actual media out there.

1547
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,864
Read my case because I am horse f***

1548
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,912
I am completely screwed

1549
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,984
And I need at least show

1550
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,312
Save myself a little bit

1551
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,616
Alex has a lot of power

1552
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
In a small sect

1553
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:56,320
If you're not in trouble you can pretend you're in a great amount of trouble cottage industry in order to make it

1554
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,112
In order to

1555
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,928
Raise your relatives

1556
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:05,792
You can make your book a bestseller probably by enough insinuation and Alex's world

1557
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Because

1558
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,120
It just is what it is a bubble

1559
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
So you can exploit

1560
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,936
But when the ship gets real

1561
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Alex can't help you

1562
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,776
That is such a strong indication of it

1563
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
He didn't say

1564
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
Hey Alex

1565
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,384
I'm going to go talk to the reporters

1566
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
He just disappeared

1567
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
And left Alex hanging

1568
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,992
And he knew Alex was on air

1569
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:29,600
He knew that and making a big deal out of how this was an exclusive

1570
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,136
Disrespectful

1571
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:40,352
It's a real dick the only thing that I'm really serious about

1572
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Is Raj

1573
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,496
In order for his image to work properly

1574
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:49,824
He needs one of those joint jokey voicemails that's like

1575
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,616
Hey how are you doing

1576
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Lawyers

1577
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,200
Voicemail

1578
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
The people

1579
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
Speed from CNN

1580
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
And

1581
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
I don't know if you watched any of this

1582
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:11,584
Didn't go well

1583
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:20,032
You know what is this was a stand-up outside tough.

1584
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:39,232
Is Inquisition

1585
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:44,352
And no way to Russian collusion

1586
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:50,752
We'll get back to this here in a second but you notice how it's almost exactly what he was saying

1587
01:22:55,616 --> 01:23:01,760
Just talked to Alex for longer than he's able to stay in front of the f*** out of there real fast

1588
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:07,136
Rogers getting food

1589
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,696
You can see it in his face the same thing you see in a comic

1590
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:15,072
I'm usually pretty good at this is

1591
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:21,472
This has gotten away from me

1592
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,640
Wikileaks collaboration

1593
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:35,040
Or any other illegal action connection for the 2016 campaign

1594
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:40,160
Russia

1595
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:59,872
So we need to talk about these things

1596
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,712
The first thing is I really hate to do this

1597
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:07,296
But I might have to give him forward partial credit for starting to lock her up

1598
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Now

1599
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,856
Not

1600
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
But it might

1601
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Yeah

1602
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:17,024
As we learned when we went over Alex's 2015 passwords accepting

1603
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,560
Trump

1604
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
But the whole time he hated Hillary

1605
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:25,984
Trump as Lord and around late December 2015

1606
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
He recognized

1607
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,848
Representative

1608
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,408
2015

1609
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,224
He sent Joe Biggs out to the rally in Texas

1610
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,808
Far we have been able to

1611
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,392
Basically weasel our way into the Hillary Clinton event

1612
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,072
Hillary t-shirt

1613
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,144
Photo of Hillary Clinton

1614
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,032
Penalized

1615
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,184
Okay it's Kishore

1616
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,584
The independent has reported that Michael stoker is credited with starting the Republican

1617
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,912
After October 2015

1618
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,216
I'm pretty easy to see how something that starts

1619
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,496
Was Hillary for prison

1620
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:35,872
To be made more charitable at Redbox

1621
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,920
Predate this field report where Joe big says

1622
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Hillary for prison

1623
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,296
And he's kind of just doing it doesn't really cool shirt

1624
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Got

1625
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:47,904
Rolling Stone was closest to capturing this in their piece about the Republic

1626
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
National Convention

1627
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:55,328
You can hear the disembodied voice of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones through downtown Cleveland

1628
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
From several blocks away

1629
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,960
Now we're going to push even harder with more Hillary for prison shirts

1630
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,520
How many Hillary for prison shirts we got

1631
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
These creatures into the microphone

1632
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:11,200
Good marketing opportunity for him

1633
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,248
Yeah

1634
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,136
It's not terrible OfferUp is much better

1635
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,024
Path could have been charted

1636
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,328
Complain about people yelling stuff at Rodger really tries

1637
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
Give a press conference

1638
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:35,008
On October 6th 2016 Alex Jones contact

1639
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:41,152
$1,000

1640
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,200
Are you get $5,000

1641
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,504
You could be heard saying Bill Clinton is a rapist

1642
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,136
Well now that I know you can afford naturally this took off

1643
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:56,256
A Warrior's began interrupting use remote

1644
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,816
We're honestly probably not even caring about the money

1645
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
How to provide a focus strategy

1646
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,400
Normalized

1647
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,216
They were longing to express

1648
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:11,104
And Alex's Bill Clinton contest it'll Realtors multiple clips of his listeners interrupting speeches and press conferences

1649
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,968
I would say that yelling lock him up at Rogers

1650
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,992
Could be seen as

1651
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,576
Like rooted in the same anti-social

1652
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,136
Impulse

1653
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
I think the context

1654
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
The different

1655
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,744
Yelling at Rodger falls under the heading of parrot

1656
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
As well as

1657
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,864
From a place that's closer to righteous indignation

1658
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
But Alex is

1659
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,704
Insane

1660
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
By doing something

1661
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,104
People to do not 3 years ago

1662
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,152
And in that

1663
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,456
From December from October 2015

1664
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,504
He's going to a Hillary rally

1665
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,808
In trying to create a spectacle and gal

1666
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:55,392
Hillary for prison so it is the same thing it's just

1667
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
You know what it turns out

1668
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,744
A lot more people coming yell at Rodger Stone

1669
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
Not hard

1670
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,888
Mobs but I wish I was part of that Mom

1671
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:10,496
It does seem like it might be a great time

1672
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
I don't know I'd need to Workshop it for a bit off the top of my head nothing really comes to my

1673
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,016
Cut his dick off

1674
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
But that's not really you got that one guy was trying to

1675
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
Just a little bit Albany

1676
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,584
Call of Duty

1677
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,056
Wood Rodgers

1678
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
To be passing out Sports

1679
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,152
RealTracs

1680
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
By the wayside

1681
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,232
It turns into a situation where

1682
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
Maybe like Rodger Stone

1683
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,704
As listeners

1684
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,008
Alex cuts.off at the path

1685
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,080
He said this repeatedly over and over again

1686
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,360
Did the people booing

1687
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,384
Our reporters

1688
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
And they're not

1689
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:27,040
No they're not

1690
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:33,440
Which is a very understandable as this is a liberal media

1691
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,744
Enemy of the media

1692
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,560
They're all in order to create the perception

1693
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,960
He's a bad man with that

1694
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
It's not true

1695
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
You can trick some people

1696
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,360
Usually

1697
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,176
Believe it's like not all journalists

1698
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:05,952
White House Press briefing

1699
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,744
All of the reporters were just like

1700
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,608
It'll be interesting

1701
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,192
So I was mad about that but here's one criticism of Rodger Stone

1702
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,104
Surprise

1703
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
Fpi

1704
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,936
They had some reason

1705
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,128
I love the idea that look like a guilty Criminal

1706
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,200
20 seconds

1707
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:04,064
Nixon I'm not a crook

1708
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,416
That was a weird movie

1709
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,464
Too on the nose

1710
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
You know what Alex

1711
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,792
This is like this is like it's like a movie

1712
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,096
If it wasn't a movie be like

1713
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
Guys

1714
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,704

You still in front of these people in

1717
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
Like doing poses

1718
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Call Rod

1719
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
He's a man address

1720
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,248
He doesn't know what to do right going through like these

1721
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:39,648
Leica MSNBC

1722
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:52,448
It's like real

1723
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,288
Comparison about what the media is

1724
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
Is doing karate

1725
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,128
And those FBI agents who

1726
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
His house

1727
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,944
How they're trying to make him look guilty

1728
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
Comparison

1729
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,528
None of us could have possibly expected

1730
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:09,344
Nope I wish I wish

1731
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
I told you this a thousand times

1732
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
Amish people

1733
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:24,192
Weird milkwort

1734
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:29,056
The government wants their property in Pennsylvania

1735
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Michigan

1736
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184
Scripps

1737
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:50,304
Chipotle year

1738
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
That was cheesy

1739
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,632
Guy goes

1740
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776

1741
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,736
49ers

1742
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,536
Willie must be bad

1743
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:27,680
Close the gate

1744
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,776
Create the appearance that Rodger

1745
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:38,176
And Alex after work is strong good for Amish or Mennonite Farm person or anything

1746
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:44,320
It's really close to that

1747
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,560
Evil laugh about this story he's kind of making things up

1748
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,864
The government is constantly

1749
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,192
Just trying to make stuff

1750
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
That's not even close to

1751
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,776
In the case of these Amish

1752
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,992
Sometimes it gives undercover agent

1753
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,808
The agent then give it to someone in another state

1754
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:21,440
Are nowhere International sales of unlicensed cheese this Amish guy is going to prison

1755
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,976

1756
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,536
Acres Farm with rape

1757
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,352
In the culmination of a drawn-out

1758
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,192
Bakersfield tons

01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:32,960
Raw milk

1760
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,264
Which has been illegal to sell across state lines

1761
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,288
Since 1980

1762
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,128
With discretion

1763
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,456
But federal law prohibits Interstate sales and for a good reason

1764
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
Raw milk is not pasteurize

1765
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:50,880
If there's no good protection against things like e-coli salmonella

1766
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,696
And the pathogen is responsible for causing tuberculosis

1767
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
And typhoid

1768
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,280

104 hospitalization

1771
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,448
Two deaths were proven to be caused by drinking raw milk

1772
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,824
Roanoke proponents claim that pasteurization kills bacteria along with the beds

1773
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,360
Those people are dumb

1774
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,712
Rainbow Acres was selling a lot of raw milk outside

1775
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:22,112
Lancaster Online article about the operation

1776
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,208
$6 a gallon for raw milk from Rainbow Acres

1777
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,536
And she was far from the only one this is a really large operation

1778
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:34,912
What are the ways of these Farms try to get around with known as a cow share program

1779
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,216
Words that have milk

1780
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,264
Farms allow people to pay a certain amount

1781
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:45,664
4th stake claim on part of an actual living cow which is the rights that animals event

1782
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,968
Will milk production literally are 49ers

1783
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:50,272
It's an old saying

1784
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
You need to buy the cow when you can't get

1785
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
Get the milk illegal

1786
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,440
Daughters note Farm in Pennsylvania call Davos Miller Farms

1787
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,304
Rainbow Acres

1788
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,936
Since they're aware they were only on the government's radar because they were definitively Trace down and being thesaurus

1789
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
Listeria outbreak

1790
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,544
They killed at least one of their customers who lived in Florida

1791
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
Outside state lines

1792
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:18,688
There's also Mark north of the nature sunlight Farm in Pennsylvania

1793
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:24,320
For flagrantly violating state regulations by publicly refusing to maintain the state raw milk permit

1794
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:27,648
He also refused to allow routine testing of his cows

1795
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:29,184
Infectious diseases like tea

1796
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,512
He's also selling tons of product across state lines

1797
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:38,144
It was received a fine of $5,100 which is nothing

1798
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:42,496
He liked the other cases that were talking about we're running a large operation

1799
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,824
These are little individual Farmers being targeted by the feds

01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,112
Which was a little bit of a smaller operations outside

1803
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,720
In March 2012 their customers reported getting sick after drinking

1804
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
The same Friday shipment

1805
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
Fromm Family Farms milk

1806
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:09,632
Stool samples revealed the presence of a campylobacter

1807
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,168
Which indicates food poison

1808
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,752
Notification of Amish bus to Pennsylvania

1809
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,312
What stories that like 1 oz

1810
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:23,200
In fact all of them are cases where people who got arrested because it was more profitable for them

1811
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,808
Probably not the hours

1812
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:35,232
Accidentally

1813
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,072
Alright if those diseases

1814
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
Words

1815
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:41,888
Contagious

1816
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,960
A little bit

1817
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
Jacob rabe

1818
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,776
Like

1819
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,944
Are you f******

1820
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:59,808
Except for the part of it being like

1821
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,416
That one case that Maryland

1822
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:09,280
They're still feeding these kids they don't have the right to

1823
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:12,608
Adult

1824
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,144
But you can make your own decision

1825
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,680
If you have all the information in front of

1826
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:22,336
You still want to drink raw milk go I have a fun time whatever you can do your thing

1827
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,384
Once you start having to be like

1828
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,712
This is what if being given to children

1829
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,992
You're an adult

1830
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
Choose if you want to get vaccinated or not

1831
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Except for the

1832
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
In terms of like

1833
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,904
The kids don't have a choice

1834
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
Orchids

1835
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,304
Measles mumps rubella

1836
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
So

1837
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,656
Apply to children

1838
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:49,472
A drought

1839
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,008
It's out.

1840
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,544
Does make a certain logical

1841
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,848
Center of

1842
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:57,664
Then you accept the cut you know it's like it's the principle of

1843
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,760
You're only hurting yourself word

1844
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,600
Got to climb a mountain and then die

1845
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,368
You're like

1846
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:16,352
High-risk high-reward

1847
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,936
Right away because how awesome would it be

Need to get on the top of the mountain

1849
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
I think I differ

1850
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,408
Milk

1851
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:33,504
Whatever

1852
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,320
Just drinking raw milk

1853
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,344
Right

1854
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,440
At this point Alex is furious

1855
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:43,744
Because Rodger Stone went out there and got

1856
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:48,864
Where was

1857
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:52,448
Like what what city was he in

1858
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:57,312
Fort Lauderdale Fort Lauderdale Florida

1859
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
If that was

1860
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:04,736
Like if I got any kind of I would start run

1861
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:11,136
Corsi's salary I would have jumped on the play I would have been on a plane

1862
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:17,536
Myself airline flights

1863
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,328
I'm going to go boom

1864
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,400
It legitimately would be like

1865
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,984
Going to Woodstock

1866
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:32,128
If it came out of nowhere so they prepared

1867
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:38,528
It is the sort of thing we're like 15 years from now based on how my life is going the last few years

1868
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,856
I would love to be able to tell people I was there

1869
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,160
I was one of those people booing Rodger Stone

1870
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,464
Like a badge of honor

1871
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
Grandpa

1872
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,144
What's your favorite memory what time

1873
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,728
You got arrested

1874
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:06,688
It like that but I've saved this one phone I brought my friend along and saved everyone

1875
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:13,088
Alex is furious about Sirius for another reason just

1876
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
The fact that like

1877
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
It went that way

1878
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,928
Which

1879
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,512
He feels that Rodger didn't listen to

1880
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
To his advice

1881
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
Because Alex told him

1882
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
If you go out there

1883
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,888
Zircon a boot

1884
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,704
Witcher 3 Alex

1885
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,240
He said he told it to him off air

1886
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
But you didn't I didn't realize

1887
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
This is going to be what happened

1888
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,480
Tara Lee

1889
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,528
He's mad for another reason

1890
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
And that again

1891
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:49,952
Is that no one is recognizing that before he went out there and got booed he was on Infowars

1892
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:56,096
He's so mad this little bit of a longer clip it again

1893
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,168
Tracking the infuriate

1894
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:03,776
How you getting madder and madder throughout this next 3 minutes I think it's very important

1895
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,944
You should make it about the attack on Free Speech when they do it

1896
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,016
Call Dave Rubin

1897
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
Wonderful

1898
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,608
Amass compliment

1899
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:36,288
Rodger Stones exclusive Global state

1900
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
That they don't want you to hear

1901
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,432
Come out

1902
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,904
Next hour

1903
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,592
We're going to come

1904
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
He doesn't do that I'm going to cut in here

1905
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:18,016
Intuitive are very brilliant about

1906
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
You predict that in a nun

1907
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,576
Controlled

1908
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,624
Environment outside a courthouse

1909
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,184
There's a decent chance at Rogers not going to

1910
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,512
Be able to spend things as well as he does on the phone with him

1911
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,120
Think Bold prediction he's not Nostradamus

1912
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,704
This is where you go Bernie Mac

1913
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,776
You motherfukers

1914
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,056
Defense right there

1915
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,080
Scared

1916
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,664
Rodger Stone 100% could have gotten on Mike and Ben like

1917
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:50,528
Y'all don't even understand I pulled my s*** out this whole room gets dark

1918
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:02,816
In Florida

1919
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,776
Better

1920
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,688
The ticket it's like weird sort of acid techno

1921
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,096
Coming out

1922
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,912
They're so out of control

1923
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,080
Oneplace.com

1924
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Outside

1925
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,064
People in the crowd

1926
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,392
Dallas County

1927
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:04,512
The crowd was steaks at

1928
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,176
The entire interview aired

1929
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
We're going to air

1930
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,552
123

1931
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,832
Swedish pie

1932
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,392
Hear what Rodger Stone

1933
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,512
The world ever seen

1934
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,584
Piranha like have no Russia collusion

1935
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
All of it

1936
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,512
Bastard

1937
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
Relationship

1938
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:18,240
Slow motion

1939
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:23,616
I'm awake

1940
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
I was just say this right now

1941
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,760
You want the globalist to win

1942
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:33,344
Already successfully basically stopped expansion planter Infowars

1943
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,464
Platform

1944
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:45,376
Ahead of the coup de gras

1945
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,400
All those little

1946
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:49,216
Establishment

1947
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:56,896
Is it emergency

1948
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:14,048
So much of this f****** episode is just

1949
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,120
Does black ice bear man

1950
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:21,472
I mean you could see if it's Eurasian there in terms of

1951
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,520
You just so pissed off that no one's giving him

1952
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,544
Except

1953
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,336
Is giving him his like

1954
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:29,664
You got to go to world exclusive

1955
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,760
He's also probably pretty pissed off cuz it's Rodger speaking

1956
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,808
Tattoo of recognized

1957
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,368
When he was talking to Alex

1958
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:44,768
I was being treated like another Outlet friend and I think I was probably has to realize that means

1959
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:49,120
Lip service enough

1960
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,960
He does call Alex back

1961
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,032
Let's not let's not ruin

1962
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:58,336
To do right what am I going to do

1963
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:01,152
Along with my dog

1964
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
I don't know

1965
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,040
Explain

1966
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,624
And they repeat

1967
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,648
Over

1968
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,184
And over and over again

1969
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:14,976
He's wrong

1970
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,080
Who's in jail

1971
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Framer

1972
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:48,512
Downhill

1973
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
That was

1974
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,096
Hundreds of millions of dollars of Wessex

1975
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,936
Sodus

1976
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,472
Put us on

1977
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
Frame

1978
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,592
Now let's look at what Alex

1979
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,456
Alex David with Hillary

1980
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:13,856
He sent out to her rallies as early as October 2015

1981
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:20,512
Making a big spectacle in the audience

1982
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Her speeches in the same way

1983
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:25,376
Video of now complaining about people

1984
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,912
That's Island sauce

1985
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,960
In the way that Alex's describe

1986
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,520
I'm starting to think that you're going to come up with some parallel

1987
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Fremont

1988
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
Alex

1989
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:39,712
He talks about Mueller on the tarmac with uranium

1990
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,992
Which is b*******

1991
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,136
Whether or not they've also committed other crimes

1992
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:51,744
I'm not interested talk about positive

1993
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:56,352
The things that Alex is specifically talking about

1994
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,888
He's trying to them

1995
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,192
Do you think your supporter of

1996
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,008
And his billions of dollars selling

1997
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
Shirt

1998
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,104
Bumper stickers about sending Hillary to jail

1999
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,152
He's tried to

2000
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,176
Frame her

2001
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,712
And put her in jail

2002
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,808
This is literally what most of the Trump energy was about

2003
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,904
Did Alex glommed onto throughout that the attire 2016 election

2004
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:23,744
It's something that Rodger Stone was instrumental in helping

2005
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,536
Create and helping perpetuate

2006
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
So Alex

2007
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:28,608
Repeating this over and over again

2008
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,144
Is if it's what's being done

2009
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,912
Him

2010
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,936
Is b*******

2011
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,960
It is his

2012
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
Tactical strategy

2013
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,800
Now what's happening

2014
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,080
The consequence

2015
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,872
Of other things

2016
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
Cuz they can get away with

2017
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,760
They can get away with all of their actions

2018
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:49,600
Disrupts peaches yelling Bill Clinton's a rapist or whatever that's fine

2019
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,136
That's not illegal

2020
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
That's fine

2021
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:56,256
Lying about Hillary Clinton selling off the uranium

2022
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:03,168
When we get to the bottom of free speech to lie about it

2023
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,800
Who gives a s*** boring

2024
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,360
Making money off of calling for her imprisonment

2025
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,640
It's all under the free speech

2026
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,688
Other things you have done

2027
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,456
Like

2028
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
Lying about

2029
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,016
Sandy Hook families

2030
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
For example

2031
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,880
Tonight at 1

2032
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,904
But that's another one

2033
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,696
There are things you can't do

2034
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,792
The chickens are coming home to

2035
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,352
If you just have never done those things

2036
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:35,168
He could do everything he's doing and no one would care

2037
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,752
Rodger Stone head White House intelligence committee

2038
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
He'd be fine

2039
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:44,640
There wouldn't be a perjury charge port

2040
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Totally on it

2041
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
If he had

2042
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:50,528
Threatened Randy credico

2043
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
Did I making it

2044
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,856
If you hadn't done things that are in that indictment

2045
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,696
Not anything that they're doing on a political level

2046
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,976
That is caused

2047
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
Downturn

2048
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,328
Specifically illegal things

2049
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:06,912
Alex

2050
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,192
That night

2051
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
He asked

2052
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
Rex

2053
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
He's like hey

2054
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:12,800
Hold on a sec

2055
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,616
Did you know

2056
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,920
What goes around

2057
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,456
It comes back

2058
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:28,672
Really really famous and common

2059
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
Called what goes around

2060
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,256
Comes around

2061
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:39,680
Justin Timberlake Justin Timberlake

2062
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:51,200
How to get Rodger back on the phone

2063
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:53,248
Rogers start

2064
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,040
Done his public

2065
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,832
Humiliation

2066
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,136
Day is now a little bit free-er to talk

2067
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,184
To Alex Wright

2068
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,208
Embody

2069
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,000
What happened after the FBI came

2070
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:09,376
Listen to that he's talking about being put in a holding cell

2071
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,680
And he even in the middle of that story

2072
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,704
Have to get in a

2073
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
Very not true plug

2074
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:29,344
American

2075
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:36,256
Presidents

2076
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:45,728
I'm sure but I do believe that happened cuz I don't believe Rodger had that conversation

2077
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:55,968
What do you think about

2078
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:01,088
Rogers given credit for them and then

2079
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:05,696
Pretending that he had a conversation with all of these wonderful black people in his holding cell

2080
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
All of these

2081
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:15,168
These people in this holding cell where black and I will draw zero conclusions from this

2082
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:21,312
I think what he was trying to save might be the benevolent a race head

2083
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,640
Thrust behind it wasn't like

2084
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,200
Hey I was in prison cell and everyone there was black

2085
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:33,856
It was to save it like there are a lot of black people who are jammed up on unnecessary

2086
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,624
Behind it

2087
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:38,720
Who was behind that is trying to support the idea that Trump

2088
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,744
Is making

2089
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,096
Something's right

2090
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:54,848
It's not and then you look a little bit further

2091
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:59,968
Illness that will happen if you drink raw milk

2092
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,040
The fever comes in waves

2093
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:06,112
So big complaint

2094
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,416
Style blog

2095
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:11,488
Lots of funny hat

2096
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:17,888
Yeah it's a style Stone style blog

2097
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
And worst

2098
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,520
So it's not then

2099
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,288
20 years

2100
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,848
And the worst part of that is I will have

2101
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
0 hat

2102
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:33,760
Yeah.

2103
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:40,160
How do you pair them with a

2104
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,304
Yeah perhaps

2105
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,608
Height

2106
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,704
He's mad

2107
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,496
Got

2108
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,800
When the FBI showed up in the morning

2109
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,336
Candyman

2110
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,896
If they just told me

2111
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:03,968
Good

2112
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,296
He's mad about that

2113
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,088
Make this complaint a number of time

2114
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,392
And while he's making it this time

2115
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,416
Alex's response

2116
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,184
Is pretty funny

2117
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,208
And very

2118
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Okay

2119
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:33,920
Call Dad

2120
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,224
I actually

2121
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,760
Telling the truth

2122
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:44,672
But yeah I know I would have

2123
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:49,280
No

2124
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:50,816
. now

2125
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,400
He could be a Flight Risk

2126
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,496
I understand why any law enforcement agency would be like

2127
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,032
Works not

2128
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:03,360
Oh for sure time knowing Rodger his is

2129
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
Extensive history

2130
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,200
The times he's been in hot water in the past

2131
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:07,968
Runaway

2132
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:11,808
So I appear to me that there's a really thinks he can get away with

2133
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:16,416
A lot of moves left to play but it doesn't appear that he does

2134
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:22,048
Probably is sincere in saying that if they just told me I would have shown that

2135
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,840
How is Jonah

2136
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,632
It's one of those things

2137
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:30,496
Cuz you like

2138
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,824
But yeah I believe

2139
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:48,416
Altitude

2140
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:55,072
Did you see that one of the first tweets about him getting arrested with her and Chad Ochocinco

2141
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:04,032
It's so so

2142
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:09,664
Rodger Stone getting arrested

2143
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:12,992
I've only seen s*** like that

2144
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,904
Such an awesome like weird cameo

2145
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,488
Indicted interested story

2146
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,816
In a weird right now

2147
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:29,120
So fun to imagine that like for you

2148
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
The years they've lived

2149
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,424
Nextdoor

2150
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:37,824
Receiver of all-time

2151
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:44,224
Rodger Stone

2152
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
For dinner sometimes

2153
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,768
Good walls make good neighbors

2154
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,792
Call Rodger Stone

2155
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,448
Have you seen the Alex Jones School of quota

2156
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
William Shake

2157
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:11,360
Remember how we mispronounced it

2158
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
Inspire

2159
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,664
No

2160
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,968
In this next clip Alex

2161
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
And Rodger

2162
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
Start talking about

2163
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,552
Rogers Finance

2164
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
End. Store

2165
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
It's real bad for him

2166
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:24,416
Real bad financially

2167
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,952
I don't believe most of it

2168
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,488
And then Alex

2169
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:44,128
Children

2170
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:13,312
Something you didn't do

2171
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:18,688
What's the temp

2172
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:24,064
Dershowitz you smart

2173
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:28,672
So there's two things there first

2174
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,208
How dare you

2175
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:34,816
Itsfunneh

2176
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,584
Four number four

2177
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:40,448
The first is that after Rodger called threatened Eliot Spitzer

2178
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:47,872
Blasted navigation was tainted from the start

2179
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,640
Eliot Spitzer

2180
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,408
For corruption

2181
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
He said

2182
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:56,576
This whole story does not pass the smell test

2183
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:59,648
Is more serious than any crime Spitzer committed

2184
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
So

2185
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:07,584
Description Rodger a little bit of the history also fun fact

2186
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:15,264
They caught Rodger red-handed lying what you did was ridiculous and stupid

2187
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,312
He went on to call Rodger a stone

2188
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:22,432
Any moment now

2189
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:32,160
Who helped them cut a deal on those operations

2190
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:35,488
If that isn't enough to get Alex to not trust the guy

2191
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:38,816
Multiple girls toward Epstein's victims have gone on record

2192
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:42,144
To them to have sex with Alan

2193
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:46,752
Conveniently doesn't care about things like this

2194
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,920
He only cares about using it as a blunt instrument

2195
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
Who taxes

2196
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
Two political enemies

2197
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:58,016
Everything is a means to an end with him

2198
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,296
And it's gross

2199
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,856
I didn't know that

2200
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:02,880
Dershowitz

2201
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,648
What is the per

2202
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,416
Participants

2203
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:10,304
I'm not sure if it's been proven in court but there are multiple victims

2204
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,840
Directed

2205
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:17,984
Alan dershowitz Chiron whenever you should be like

2206
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,752
Accused

2207
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,032
F****** pedophile

2208
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:23,872
Red Blick

2209
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,200
It should roll on the bottom

2210
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,736
Television news

2211
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:35,136
Their policies are on that but I wouldn't

2212
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,256
Everything

2213
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,024
He says

2214
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,304
About all this stuff should

2215
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:48,960
Anyone being caught

2216
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:49,984
Except for Trump

2217
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,008
Of course

2218
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:07,648
He loves Jeffrey Epstein whenever his political enemies are sort of related to Jeffrey

2219
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,976
Subway it's the biggest eel in the world it's proof of

2220
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:12,768
Xy&z everyday

2221
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,096
Someone who supports Trump or is literally Trump

2222
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:21,984
Absolutely.

2223
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:27,616
About this is Rodger telling his sob story about how this f******

2224
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Of crimes

2225
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:32,224
Committed is hurting his book sale

2226
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
And stuff like that

2227
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:37,600
There's an episode of his goddamn radio show

2228
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,184
What are you talkin about the WikiLeaks

2229
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
Stuff it just come out

2230
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,000
And he's talking about

2231
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:46,560
Which was the first

2232
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,328
You gave

2233
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,352
Assange

2234
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:53,728
Beautiful back-channel source

2235
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,008
It's a treat

2236
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,056
The person who gave us on.

2237
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:00,128
You know who else was saying that around that time

2238
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,408
F****** Jerome corsi

2239
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,968
You know who else is episode

2240
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,272
Jerome corsi

2241
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,624
Think about this

2242
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
The stuff

2243
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:15,232
He goes into a little bit of a diatribe

2244
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:19,584
Like

2245
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,144
His time in the barrel was constantly

2246
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,448
You know what's really great about that

2247
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,240
Is that I've been able to go on

2248
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:31,104
So if you're going to exploit

2249
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,128
Disorder Scituate

2250
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,456
The murder of of somebody

2251
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,760
Further your political

2252
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,552
Conspiratorial bulshit

2253
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,600
You're going to be like

2254
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,392
I'm not going to feel any sympathy

2255
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:45,440
For you when you complain about

2256
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,976
I don't have any money now

2257
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:48,768
Because of

2258
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:49,536
Prime

2259
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,144
How many

2260
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,728
Multiply don't know how many kids he has

2261
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,336
Your stone must be

2262
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
Bummer

2263
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:04,896
Man

2264
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,992
From the Press

2265
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:13,088
Holyshit did you know that what goes around

2266
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,136
That's Justin Timberlake

2267
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:17,696
He's not he's one of those dudes

2268
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:19,488
If you ever hear stories about

2269
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,280
The children of

2270
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:25,632
Old school pro wrestlers

2271
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,680
Fake an injury

2272
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:34,080
Emagine Rochester

2273
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,128
Instead of

2274
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,664
Sports entertainment

2275
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,688
It's like

2276
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:43,040
Malicious International propaganda

2277
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
Kids

2278
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,648
I know your ages for

2279
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
But

2280
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:53,792
The first thing I need to tell you and I wish I could have told you when you came out of the womb

2281
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,864
Never Google

2282
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,680
He said that before Google

2283
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:02,240
Next

2284
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,520
Alex reinforces

2285
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,920
You're next in the hopper

2286
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,736
He told everybody that

2287
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
Shmoney

2288
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:18,624
Because

2289
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:24,256
It was for cause though

2290
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,864
He wasn't living up to his application

2291
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,424
His contract could not have been paid out

2292
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,264
The quote from Alex Jones is that article was about

2293
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,056
We decided to pay him out based on

2294
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
Consideration

2295
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,360
Cast for

2296
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,640
So many

2297
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,432
And I believe her too I don't know

2298
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,456
And I'm a dentist

2299
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,928
Shmoney

2300
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,464
Porter's

2301
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:06,240
Silence some

2302
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,544
Put him in jail

2303
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,336
Reporters

2304
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:14,432
Fine petting reporters $160,000 a year

2305
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,224
That's a difference

2306
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,040
Especially when that reporter is

2307
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:19,808
Worthless

2308
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,904
We've been covering Alex Jones

2309
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,952
Jerome corsi has

2310
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:28,768
Done s*** except for tendies opening that watching

2311
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:35,424
I tried to come up with the map it was just a dumb Seth rich

2312
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,704
Yeah yeah

2313
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,728
We've heard him

2314
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,776
Just s*** the bed over and over again

2315
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,544
And then

2316
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,640
Be kicked off being allowed to be on the show cuz he went to into the kiwi

2317
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,664
Disturbed

2318
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,016
No purpose will believe that

2319
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:56,416
I haven't read any of his books but break

2320
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:02,816
Like even before we put this episode out and they want more answers about the Kursi business

2321
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,864
Because I think this is a really big

2322
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:10,496
But unfortunately I regret to say we

2323
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,032
We can't offer much on that

2324
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,336
We will be able to soon

2325
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:17,920
We will

2326
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:23,296
Yeah

2327
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:31,232
As soon as that information is available

2328
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:33,280
I assure you we will do

2329
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,304
Of course he episode

2330
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,656
Although I don't think Alex will even talk about it

2331
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,680
Of course

2332
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,704
Turn South

2333
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:44,800
Chico State's evidence property like Beanie Sigel

2334
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:48,640
Another rap reference

2335
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:55,296
Woke up on Timberlake reference

2336
02:08:55,552 --> 02:09:00,928
Like three episodes of it like Three 6 Mafia references National napping Seagal

2337
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:01,696
Yeah

2338
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:03,744
Jadakiss is coming up

2339
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,792
Next episode Swizz Beatz

2340
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:08,096
Drag on

2341
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:10,912
That means dragon

2342
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:13,728
I'm surprised there wasn't a

2343
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:20,896
When I woke up on Friday one of the things that I

2344
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,432
The Hat in my mind

2345
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,712
First was

2346
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,248
I woke up pretty early

2347
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,296
I'm surprised I woke up pretty early

2348
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
I crack my back

2349
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
Set down

2350
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,672
Got to work

2351
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:38,048
Twitter messages

2352
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:40,096
La Michoacana

2353
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:46,752
I woke up early. Early it up

2354
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:53,408
Aethersphere kind of Rodger is on like an hour ahead

2355
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:59,808
Possible that I couldn't sleep because I knew was going on but also possible that I was just playing Hyrule Warriors

2356
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,088
Who knows

2357
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,584
Like what I woke up

2358
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,168
I was kind of overwhelmed by the amount of people

2359
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:17,472
I appreciate

2360
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:21,056
But my immediate first thought was like

2361
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:23,360
Is imallexx right now

2362
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,968
I took me an hour or so to make an egg sandwich

2363
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:28,736
Process

2364
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,528
Just get my bearings about me

2365
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,064
I started to dig like it

2366
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,832
10

2367
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,136
Alex knows that in an hour

2368
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:35,904
He's got to get on

2369
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,952
He knows that right now

2370
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:42,304
Alex knows he has to get on it

2371
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,608
And secondarily

2372
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,888
Alex Munoz

2373
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,936
Everybody is tuning a

2374
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,472
Alex knost

2375
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,800
He's kicked off YouTube and stuff like that

2376
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:54,080
He can still broadcast

2377
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:57,664
You can still live stream all this s***

2378
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,480
All eyes are on him there is no way

2379
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:01,760
The people are going to be like

2380
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,344
Lo and behold

2381
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,880
It was it was a raid

2382
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:10,208
We were getting 50,000

2383
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,936
Builder

2384
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:36,064
RadioShack

2385
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,864
Give me credit

2386
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,400
For the world

2387
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:53,728
I don't believe we made this point we are on

2388
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,520
The Great

2389
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:56,288
Robert Evans

2390
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:01,408
I don't believe those specific

2391
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
Behind

2392
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
The idea that

2393
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,296
He had massively elevator

2394
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:15,744
He's going to pull out a tree

2395
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:19,584
Obfuscating

2396
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,400
Excuse-making thing I've ever seen in my life

2397
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:23,680
I was watching live

2398
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:28,032
There was at least a number of

2399
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:35,968
Who don't generally watch who like

2400
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,248
Thousands and thousands

2401
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,528
More people were like

2402
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,808
Here we go

2403
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,600
For sure so Alex knew that

2404
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,720
Not nearly as high as

2405
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,304
Bring some

2406
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,584
The focus why

2407
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,376
He's more restrained

2408
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,680
Cuz he realized

2409
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,216
There are a lot of people

2410
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,496
Watching

2411
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,520
They have an expectation

2412
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:00,800
I've got a freak out

2413
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:01,824
Keep it together

2414
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:04,128
Also explains why

2415
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:04,896
You keep asking me

2416
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,688
People for money right because

2417
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,736
There's so many more people

2418
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:12,064
There's a better chance

2419
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,368
So all of this makes total sense

2420
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,904
He knows that this is sweeps

2421
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:19,488
Yeah it's bad

2422
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:21,024
Definitely going to prison

2423
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:24,608
He's still a businessman

2424
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:29,728
I don't do this without Rodger

2425
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:34,592
I don't really either cuz I I use your no like I just use a flat rate

2426
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,920
But from what I understand like

2427
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,968
If you host something somewhere

2428
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:49,184
The traffic goes up in order for the server

2429
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:56,864
Traffic

2430
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,168
The flat rate

2431
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,240
Be the service that I use

2432
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,312
I just need to pay a certain amount per month

2433
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,128
And no matter how many people downloaded

2434
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,408
Or anything like that

2435
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
You pay for the

2436
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,784
Gato however large files are that I post

2437
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,416
And their strategies that they host

2438
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,464
Thousands of shows

2439
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:25,792
No one down

2440
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,096
Rocks that are

2441
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,632
It's called medicare-for-all

2442
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:33,728
They liberated syndication is figured out

2443
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:36,032
Socialized medicine for podcast

2444
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:43,200
It doesn't matter at all it only comes into

2445
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
Play if you're host

2446
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:46,016
Open your own s*** in your own servers

2447
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,808
I got you

2448
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,368
Fine

2449
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,672
Do it yeah I mean the reason

2450
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:54,208
Because then there's no way for anybody

2451
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:58,304
Take that.

2452
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:04,448
Freedom's that you're

2453
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:07,008
You you so desire

2454
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:08,032
Libertarian

2455
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:11,104
Sure Alex has a new guy

2456
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:13,152
Rodger is gone he's got to go take a shower

2457
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,688
Got to shave his hair

2458
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:16,480
All that nonsense

2459
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:18,784
Comfort his dog

2460
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,368
There's no doubt about it

2461
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:26,464
So pathetic

2462
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,000
Is next guest

2463
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:30,048
Is Rodger Stones lawyer

2464
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:33,632
Cheap lawyers

2465
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,080
Okay she's okay

2466
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:47,200
Chinon and Alex Jones

2467
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,000
Do you work here

2468
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:03,328
How they operate

2469
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:16,896
Yeah he's a spokesperson

2470
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:18,944
Spokesperson

2471
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:22,272
It's interesting that Rodger Stones lawyer is named Nixon

2472
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:26,112
I was really curious about this

2473
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:30,720
Real I was really confused

2474
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:35,328
I wanted to know if he was related to Richard Nixon sings Rodger was so connected

2475
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,096
Richard Nixon

2476
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,376
What does it look like

2477
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,912
At least not closely

2478
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:42,240
Neither of them has a kid named Tyler

2479
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:44,288
Husbands names

2480
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,312
When they got married

2481
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,360
Cox and Eisenhower respectively

2482
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:50,944
Nixon's daughter married Eisenhower's grandson

2483
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,504
So it's cool everybody's Great America

2484
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,576
There's no sort of power delete that

2485
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,344
Pitchfork

2486
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:59,904
Pitchforks by white

2487
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,672
Pitchforks up

2488
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:07,072
Hearing whenever we talk or how do we not know that

2489
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:10,912
Stopboor public knowledge

2490
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:12,448
Reindeer

2491
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:16,032
Nixon is a part of Nixon

2492
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,848
Is a second cousin or some s***

2493
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:21,920
Rogers lawyers however

2494
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:24,480
He's a bad person for Alex to have on the show

2495
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,784
Unbiased source of information

2496
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:33,184
Ucpac in November 2018 Tyler Dixon was questioned by Robert Mueller about Rogers connections

2497
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:40,352
Remember all the new stories that Rogers Associates being called in for questioning

2498
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:48,032
You indicated that go with Rogers

2499
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:52,640
This is a problem

2500
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:59,040
Because it means that if credico was not being which he wasn't making up in

2501
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:03,136
30 told Mother about Quantico

2502
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:04,160
And that means

2503
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:06,208
Tyler Nixon is in trouble too

2504
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,024
This isn't a lawyer trying to help his client

2505
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:14,912
This is a man who realizes that he fell into the same perjury trap his client

2506
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:17,216
Maybe with Rodger

2507
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:21,312
Since it's clear they both lied to achieve the same end result

2508
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:22,336
Which is

2509
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:24,128
It might not have been Tyler's

2510
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,920
Primary motivation

2511
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:27,456
But the end result

2512
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:31,552
Does covering up Jerome corsi's involvement with Rodger Stone

2513
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:34,880
Visa V the Wikileaks interaction

2514
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:39,488
Even if your client is even if you have it

2515
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,256
Client privilege

2516
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,024
Jr Direct

2517
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:41,792
By your client

2518
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:42,560
To say something

2519
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:44,352
You still lied to Congress

2520
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,376
So you're kind of

2521
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,680
I'm at I'm at front there's no

2522
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:54,080
Was introduced new

2523
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,360
Because he said that

2524
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:58,176
Key Witness creticos

2525
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,200
Which isn't

2526
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:04,832
Like it's one thing to say Rodger told me this or whatever

2527
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:07,136
Information

2528
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,720
I mean who knows

2529
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:11,744
I don't think that

2530
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,512
He's telling the truth

2531
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:14,048
Austin Rogers

2532
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,584
Fake tan

2533
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,120
Knowledge of Rodger Stone

2534
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:18,400
I feel like

2535
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,728
Rodger bus at this sequence of events

2536
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,752
Must have been

2537
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:26,336
Rodger like accidentally Googling

2538
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:32,736
Like Nixon lawyer in this guy came up and he was like for me to have Nixon lawyer

2539
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:35,808
That's entirely possible

2540
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:46,816
You don't report himself on the show if any kind of a professional

2541
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,632
He's just throwing around the globalist to come in

2542
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:53,728
He's just you might as well be like Alex's

2543
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,520
Norfolk regular gas

2544
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:58,592
He does not hear them say anything

2545
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,896
Who's word like pro bono

2546
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:02,944
Jurisprudence

2547
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:09,344
Illegal words

2548
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,136
Graduate

2549
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,720
Be f****** stupid

2550
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:15,744
Because he says this

2551
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,280
Attacktix

2552
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:19,328
Report on Rodger Stone who would be just

2553
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,352
First I'm sure

2554
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,400
If people have their way

2555
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,192
Would make lavrentiy Beria

2556
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:25,984
And Stalin and Hitler

2557
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:29,824
And the rest of them and Barrister or

2558
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:35,712
I was just a child as far as you know

2559
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:37,760
I would absolutely love to have this type of

2560
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:38,528
Power

2561
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:40,320
Alex Jones

2562
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:42,624
BTU 2 vocab word

2563
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,904
That's not good

2564
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,208
As a lawyer

2565
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:53,376
Hey let me correct you on what it is when you think you're saying help you out of that little pickle yours

2566
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:59,520
To remind you that Stalin put hundreds of thousands of people

2567
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:00,288
Gulag

2568
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:03,616
Rodger Stone

2569
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:04,640
Being embarrassed

2570
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,456
A charge

2571
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:08,224
Almost

2572
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,760
Clearly

2573
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:16,160
That off of how they made Rodger Stone

2574
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:19,488
Whatever's going on right now is

2575
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:22,048
Is well within the abilities of star

2576
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,328
Himmler and anybody else

2577
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:26,144
This is pathetic level

2578
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:32,288
Of of what they perceived to be what's happening to them

2579
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:33,568
In order to

2580
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,592
Convince the audience

2581
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,128
Miss so much

2582
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:36,896
Dyer

2583
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:39,968
Because they need their money

2584
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,760
They want the f****** money

2585
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,576
It's just constantly

2586
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:50,976
Give Rodger Stone legal defense money

2587
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,304
Donate to Rogers.

2588
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:03,520
About that you didn't do it just dawned on me

2589
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,080
That's why he's lying

2590
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:12,480
Pulling this bull was wrapped up in the weed I got the Rodger Stone legal defense fund

2591
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,272
Dot-com probably

2592
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,808
Absolutely

2593
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:20,160
This is so f****** stupid

2594
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:21,184
Like

2595
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:23,232
The idea that they're saying

2596
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,280
Is is still Wild

2597
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:26,560
So nuts

2598
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:31,680
What

2599
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,448
Exact

2600
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,240
Termite

2601
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:35,776
But I'm going to go with

2602
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,712
Ambulance chaser

2603
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:44,992
What is it with

2604
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:45,760
Right wing

2605
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:48,832
F****** lawyers like

2606
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,392
But I think

2607
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:57,280
Exhausted all other possibilities

2608
02:22:57,792 --> 02:23:03,936
Like a real lawyer

2609
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:07,520
I'm going to lose

2610
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:09,568
Turn off

2611
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:12,384
In my name is going to be

2612
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:13,920
We f****** destroy

2613
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:16,480
Alex I think they're just like

2614
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:17,760
He hit his like

2615
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:18,528
The resource

2616
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:23,136
You talk about like the idea like

2617
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:25,696
This is billable hours

2618
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:27,232
You also have to recognize the

2619
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:28,768
Like what you're doing it

2620
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,304
It's a possibility

2621
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,840
You're going to be

2622
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,608
Defending

2623
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:33,376
Alex

2624
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:35,424
Against

2625
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,728
Victims family

2626
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:41,056
And the Optics of that are never good

2627
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:45,152
Talking as a human you know that Alex

2628
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:51,040
Guilty

2629
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,064
He did do that

2630
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:55,904
It's one of those things that you're only going to be

2631
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,208
Just f******

2632
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:14,592
Mystic on some level but those people still do need representation

2633
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:17,664
Everybody has the right to a fair trial

2634
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,016
You are not going to have a trap

2635
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,040
Well

2636
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,320
It's an indication I

2637
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,368
Come to a point

2638
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:28,928
Where you're willing to pay way more than you need

2639
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:30,720
Because no one else will

2640
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:35,584
And you're trying a Hail Mary free speech type app

2641
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,352
And I think that's

2642
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:43,008
A short-term loan like one of those like

2643
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:43,776
Why is he in

2644
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:46,080
Straight 200,000 percent that doesn't

2645
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,176
At this point

2646
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,784
This episode is no longer Subs

2647
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,576
We have reached

2648
02:24:56,832 --> 02:24:58,112
The point where Alex

2649
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:01,696
I don't know what happened to it but he starts losing his mind

2650
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:06,048
Does he start talking about God

2651
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:12,192
He's only got nothing on Rodger Stone because Stone bailed on him

2652
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:13,472
Ghosted him

2653
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:19,104
So Alex can't like pivot other news

2654
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:24,480
What is it going to be there is no news

2655
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:30,880
LaRosa's criticized

2656
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:34,208
Cold

2657
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,072
Inside of himself in

2658
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:39,840
Pray

2659
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,376
Does he also Big Sur

2660
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,144
She's going to get far

2661
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,936
It's pretty amazing that you

2662
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:48,032
Houses done with his

2663
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,312
Is work

2664
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:50,080
Weird

2665
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:51,360
I try and give some sort

2666
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:53,152
Real baby

2667
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,968
Real fun sort of introduction

2668
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:57,504
He starts talking about God.

2669
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:00,320
And next he starts walking talking about.

2670
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:04,416
I should be at least

2671
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:07,232
I complimented your instincts

2672
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:13,888
Mainstream National News host calling upsetting word is Mueller's coming after you next one comment

2673
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:20,288
How to cover up. Being a little kid that kids on

2674
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:36,160
Motor all you guys

2675
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:38,720
Jesus Christ

2676
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:42,304
Salt

2677
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:46,656
End of the show very f*****-up

2678
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:48,960
As it goes along like

2679
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:52,544
What I was listening to this on Friday

2680
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:54,592
I thought the first hour was

2681
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:55,360
Disaster

2682
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:56,384
And super boring

2683
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:02,784
Are we going over it in terms of Rogers Bland statement

2684
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,856
The dynamic of Alex be pissed off that no one recognized

2685
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:06,624
Exclusive

2686
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,952
Pretty interesting but I didn't think there was a full episode out of that

2687
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:12,512
Towards the middle

2688
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:14,048
The end of the show

2689
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:15,072
And Alex

2690
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,376
So unbelievably weird

2691
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,424
In the way that you would have expected him to

2692
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,312
You coming to the show

2693
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:26,336
And what I imagine

2694
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:28,640
Imagine

2695
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:31,200
He did his first hour and a half or so

2696
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:32,992
Lost a ton of listeners

2697
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:37,088
They're like alright whatever whatever

2698
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:39,904
Alex's bringing it whatever

2699
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,952
Broccoli

2700
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:42,976
I'm talking about.

2701
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:45,024
Workout

2702
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:54,240
Weird right we will get to Galactic Quest

2703
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:56,288
By the end of this

2704
02:27:56,544 --> 02:28:02,688
Quest

2705
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:04,224
There's one more clip

2706
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,272
Sort of political nonsense

2707
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,088
Pissing yourself

2708
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:11,648
Polysyndeton Mueller's people

2709
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:16,256
Set us up our daughter Jedi released the big set of stuff yet

2710
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:20,096
Cuz you don't have any

2711
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,144
Close to that

2712
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,704
But it doesn't really matter anymore

2713
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:29,568
Country Organics

2714
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:35,456
If you don't know that everyday

2715
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:46,464
Jostens Soros or La organ or DC

2716
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:52,608
Arch was America's going down

2717
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:57,216
Now it is

2718
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:03,616
Yeah also I like it

2719
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:06,176
America's never great

2720
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,456
He says cherry picking

2721
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:08,480
And you're like

2722
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:10,272
You're really close to same

2723
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:12,320
Cotton Pickin which is kind of

2724
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:13,344
The point

2725
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,672
Just refuses to engage with the actual argument

2726
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:21,024
America will be great

2727
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,560
Until we get to

2728
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,840
You know when we have

2729
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:24,864
You know just

2730
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:26,400
Enough equality

2731
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:27,936
We deal with issues

2732
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,960
Realistically

2733
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:31,776
Those arguments Arts America

2734
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:33,824
It's

2735
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,944
Do you understand

2736
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:41,248
Guilt

2737
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:45,856
You have like a shame is I am bad guilt is I did something

2738
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:49,440
To make between those things

2739
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,464
And when people

2740
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,000
Teak America for like

2741
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:54,304
I don't know our interventions

2742
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,656
Venezuela in Central America

2743
02:29:58,912 --> 02:30:00,704
Our interventions all over the world

2744
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,240
We turned of

2745
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:04,544
Crime against humanity into a wonderful

2746
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,568
Stores

2747
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:08,640
Are deeply deeply racist history

2748
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:09,664
Slavery

2749
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:13,504
It was probably

2750
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,832
Contact leasing programs

2751
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:22,464
Became

2752
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,744
We suck and shoot

2753
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,536
Kill ourselves in America

2754
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,304
Begone

2755
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,352
It's just a weed

2756
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:30,656
We need to own up to

2757
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,448
And that's the only path forward

2758
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:33,984
We won't be great

2759
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:36,544
Until we acknowledge those things and works

2760
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:38,336
And Alex's

2761
02:30:38,592 --> 02:30:39,360
It just is inability

2762
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:40,384
Understand

2763
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,152
You poor thing

2764
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:42,688
Ability

2765
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:43,968
Unwillingness

2766
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:45,504
Understand

2767
02:30:46,016 --> 02:30:50,368
Leaves interview like

2768
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:51,904
Overly simplistic

2769
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:54,976
Are still above

2770
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:56,000
So now

2771
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:57,536
Get to the park for this is

2772
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:01,376
Okay

2773
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:05,472
I'm excited Alex starts fake crying

2774
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:08,544
But what triggers him to start fake crying

2775
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:10,848
Is that he starts talking about

2776
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:11,872
Actually cry

2777
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,408
Which is weird

2778
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,944
Because the memory

2779
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:15,712
Of him

2780
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,760
Talkin about crying

2781
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:18,784
Leads him to

2782
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:19,808
Fake crying

2783
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:22,368
It's very strange cuz it shouldn't be

2784
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:23,392
Memories

2785
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:25,184
Super painful

2786
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:27,744
Whenever I think back on times I've cried that does

2787
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,024
Super emotional

2788
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,584
But when I was crying it was because I was

2789
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:32,864
Else

2790
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,400
That wasn't emotionally resonant

2791
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:36,960
Crying isn't

2792
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:39,520
The emotionally it's a byproduct

2793
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:40,800
Of the emotionally resume

2794
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:44,128
Cuz that's cuz you're a human

2795
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:50,528
Alex talks about crying he's reminded I should probably pretend

2796
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:51,296
Promotion

2797
02:31:56,928 --> 02:32:01,536
Sometimes just leaned up against the wall cuz I've got

2798
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,008
This is a fake

2799
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:26,368
Washington Washington

2800
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,304
I'm not scared

2801
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:43,264
To make sure that goddamn

2802
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,080
Country

2803
02:32:56,064 --> 02:33:00,672
My favorite thing about Alex's when he gets on a roll if you have nothing

2804
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:03,488
The thing

2805
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:06,816
Spielberg's wife

2806
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,864
Temple of Doom level of acting

2807
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:16,800
It's so bad but also it's really interesting because you know you know it's all fake and performative that

2808
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:19,616
The way that Alex can only contextualize B

2809
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:26,528
Fake showing the vulnerability if transitions to rate that the only way to understand

2810
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:28,320
Is the presentation of that emotion

2811
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:29,856
Because he beams itweak

2812
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:31,648
Right thanks it's a weakness

2813
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,696
And then in order to compensate for that you

2814
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:35,744
You have to Pivot that right

2815
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:37,792
And it's pathetic

2816
02:33:40,352 --> 02:33:41,632
It is one of those like

2817
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:45,216
You understand humans

2818
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:47,520
It's one of those like Psychopaths

2819
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:50,592
I don't know if you

2820
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:51,872
Feel human emotion

2821
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:57,248
I know you know it's totally possible

2822
02:33:57,504 --> 02:34:00,832
He feels normal emotions it is

2823
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:03,648
It's so it's so hard to say

2824
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:04,928
She was fake crying in

2825
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:10,560
Pathetic performative aspect

2826
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:11,328
Me like

2827
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:12,608
Calling it

2828
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,656
Psychopath Behavior

2829
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:18,496
I'm up perform felt like

2830
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,288
Absolute garbage

2831
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:23,616
You know you put on the you put on the calendar

2832
02:34:23,872 --> 02:34:26,944
40 million Metro

2833
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:28,224
But not making

2834
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:31,808
Gross

2835
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,344
It's all him

2836
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,368
Yeah no

2837
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:36,928
None of that money is coming in from David Knight show

2838
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,768
Like it's on his back

2839
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,560
But he knows he's going to bring it

2840
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:45,888
40 bucks

2841
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,680
It's kind of like having a big set

2842
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,984
Yeah at least

2843
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,264
Sounds like you got to do

2844
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,288
What you got to do

2845
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:53,824
For this operation

2846
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:57,664
Well if you've ever read the late night

2847
02:34:58,944 --> 02:34:59,712
Oh you guys are

2848
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:02,784
F****** crazy pressure is insane

2849
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:07,648
And like

2850
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:08,416
How bad

2851
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:09,696
He's living

2852
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:10,464
But like

2853
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:16,096
No amount of pressure is going to

2854
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:16,864
To make you

2855
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:18,400
This awful

2856
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:20,704
It's going to reveal that you are this

2857
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:22,240
Perhaps

2858
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:26,080
Talk in a little bit throughout this episode about

2859
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,384

2860
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,968

Just grab Alex

2869
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:19,072
We find this is really what it's all about

2870
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:37,504
We need to be flooded

2871
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:42,624
A regular basis

2872
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:55,936
Rodger rabbit

2873
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,008

2874
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:01,824

I know that in our show it's been a couple hours since we talked about that

2906
02:38:31,936 --> 02:38:32,704
Still

2907
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:36,544

Has come out and said

2931
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,712

02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:05,376
No big deal

2937
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:07,168
Whatever

2938
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,192

If the president

2943
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:23,552
Guilty

2944
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:32,512

Not it in these matches like

2952
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:53,248
She does a great job

2953
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,528
Because it's

2954
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,296
Job

2955
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:56,832
To be better deflect

02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:01,952
No never ends

2957
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:03,744
That is

2958
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:04,768
It really makes

2959
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:05,536
It's me

2960
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,304
Sad for her

2961
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:07,584

02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:13,728
Like that

2963
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:14,752
But that

2964
02:41:15,008 --> 02:41:16,800
That makes me sad for her because I just

2965
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:19,616
The childhood that

2966
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:20,640
Huckabee gave her

2967
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:22,176
Turned her into

2968
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:23,200

2970
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:24,736

02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:27,040
Imagine growing up with Mike Huckabee azure

02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
Because like

2973
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:34,464
Mike Huckabee

2974
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,232
Politics are

2975
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:36,256
Terrible but

2976
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:42,912
His brand does seem to be like he's a good guy

2977
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:44,192
He plays the bass

2978
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,616
Daughter

2979
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:56,224
Hard

2980
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:05,440
So I bring this up is Sarah Huckabee Sanders has come out and said like f*** this noise that's not on

2981
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:15,168
Which is a good thing to say as opposed to

2982
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:18,496
Or like oh yeah working on this or something.

2983
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:20,032
Course that's a response

2984
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:21,312
And it leaves Alex.

2985
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:23,616
F****** pissed off

2986
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:24,640

2988
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:28,736
To Rogers a prize

2989
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:30,528
You know what it turns out

2990
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:31,296
They're just Joe

2991
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:32,064
Jealous

2992
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:51,008
Very angry

2993
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:55,872
To where you are

2994
02:42:57,664 --> 02:43:01,504
My brother

2995
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:09,440
Ossify

2996
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:12,512
I like this

2997
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:13,280
I wish I would have

2998
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:14,816
Did they start making

2999
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:16,608
Jokes by the globalist

3000
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:25,312
All of you

3001
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:27,616

3002
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:31,968
It's very weird still Alex Rogers lawyer Tyler

3003
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,368
I promise you

3004
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:40,672
In a couple of clips

3005
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:42,720
This will deteriorate back

3006
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:46,816
To the god

3007
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:48,096
But this dislike

3008
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:50,656
There's all this f******

3009
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,704
You just love the people

3010
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,496
You're so f****** pissed off

3011
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:56,032
Where is the real power

3012
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,080
That's why they don't

3013
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,360
Respect Stone

3014
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,432
Thumbs up

3015
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:06,784
Problem

3016
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:08,576
You should go to jail

3017
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:10,880
I think he might

3018
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:13,952
I mean based on what I know from his testimony

3019
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:16,768
Like he did get questioned by Mueller

3020
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:19,072
From everything I could tell from

3021
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:21,376
What statements

3022
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,656
The credit go is dead

3023
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,424
Like

3024
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,448
I mean whatever

3025
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:26,240
Does contradict

3026
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:27,264
What is

3027
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,592
Yeah

3028
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:36,736
It's because it's cute

3029
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:37,504
Yeah

3030
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:39,808
It's because Rodger documented it

3031
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:46,208
It's his only out is

3032
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:48,256
Is Mueller being like

3033
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:50,304
You're just a shity

3034
02:44:51,072 --> 02:44:51,584
You didn't

3035
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,376
Year you're just bad at your job

3036
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:56,192
Disbarred

3037
02:44:58,496 --> 02:44:59,008
He could

3038
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:01,312
In situations like this

3039
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,336
I think that

3040
02:45:02,592 --> 02:45:03,872
A lot of lower

3041
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,152
Wrong

3042
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:06,432
People probably are going

3043
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:10,272
I think he might be able to in terms of

3044
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:12,832
Piece of information

3045
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:14,112
Wood glue

3046
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:14,880
From your quest

3047
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:18,976
Has helped us figure out X wires

3048
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:20,768
I don't think

3049
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:22,304
The f****** Tyler Knicks

3050
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:24,096

3051
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:26,912
I would mind

3052
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:33,312
But I put my flag on that Hill though

3053
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:36,896

3054
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:37,920

02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:06,015
I'm sure he's probably

3163
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:08,063
Stupid bucks a week

3164
02:52:08,575 --> 02:52:09,087
Talk about that

3165
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,367
20 bucking minutes

3166
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:11,391
Button

3167
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:12,927
We got to talk about how Ally

3168
02:52:13,695 --> 02:52:14,463
Getting weird

3169
02:52:15,487 --> 02:52:15,999
Now

3170
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:21,631
Next

3171
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:22,911
We have one clip

3172
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:23,935
And then

3173
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:24,959
It's Austin

3174
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:28,031
The

3175
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:29,055
Cliff

3176
02:52:29,567 --> 02:52:30,335
Esoteric

3177
02:52:30,847 --> 02:52:32,639
Weird nonsense Hellyeah

3178
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:36,735
Is spoiler alert going to essentially the voice of God

3179
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:38,015
There is a tree

3180
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:39,807
It's in the River of Life

3181
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:44,671
Because that's vague

3182
02:52:47,231 --> 02:52:47,999
Towards the end of this

3183
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:49,535
But

3184
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:50,559
Before he

3185
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:51,327
He does

3186
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:55,167
She's got to talk a little bit more about what we learned on Christmas

3187
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:56,191
2018

3188
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:57,471
About how Alex

3189
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:58,495
Call Rodger

3190
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:01,567
Alex

3191
02:53:02,847 --> 02:53:03,359
And I think that's

3192
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:04,383
6 mm into

3193
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:06,175
Like full-on freakout

3194
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:16,927
Cassandra

3195
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:25,631
You got your job back with a Fox News contributor

3196
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:29,983
Pay $50,000 a year

3197
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:34,847
Was that why

3198
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:56,351
We don't take it seriously happened

3199
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:01,471
To make it look like it's legitimate

3200
02:54:05,567 --> 02:54:06,335
Mike manafort

3201
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:08,639
You're going to walk into that

3202
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:12,735
Wheelchair

3203
02:54:13,503 --> 02:54:16,831
Show show

3204
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:19,647
Real persecution

3205
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:26,559
If America fails his test

3206
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:44,223
I don't know I am tired of Alex

3207
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:44,991
She's like lions

3208
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:52,415
Trump

3209
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:58,815
More real than the others

3210
02:54:59,071 --> 02:55:00,095
Only because it's like

3211
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:01,887
It affect his bottom line

3212
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,935
But I still I still don't give a fuk

3213
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:08,287
A hundred percent

3214
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:12,639
Like believes Rogers version of the timeline

3215
02:55:19,295 --> 02:55:25,439
I'm almost there

3216
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:29,279
I have a special investigation

3217
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:31,327
You directed yourself

3218
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:33,887
Two years ago to learn more about that

3219
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:36,959
I've been I've Been Told

3220
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:38,239
Teasing you a little bit

3221
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:42,335
Cuz I was freaking out a little bit earlier

3222
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:44,895
And he does freaked out really hard

3223
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:48,735
But I kind of forgot as we were going through it there a couple of those like

3224
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:49,503
Substance

3225
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:55,135
The clips like how I gave Rodger

3226
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:57,439
This job and I told him to get

3227
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:58,207
Condition

3228
02:55:58,463 --> 02:56:03,583
Of getting this job I hired him

3229
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:05,887
Alex is going to say he didn't

3230
02:56:07,935 --> 02:56:12,031
Is eats the grounding aspect of but then

3231
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:15,103
Clip Jordan he goes up there goes gravity

3232
02:56:16,127 --> 02:56:17,919
Mom's spaghetti company

3233
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:20,735
Because Alex accidentally

3234
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:23,807
Starts talking about why he does his

3235
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:24,575
Haha

3236
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:25,599
Why does Alec

3237
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:28,159
He admits why

3238
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:33,023
I have one skill I have

3239
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:35,839
What is a crime

3240
02:56:40,447 --> 02:56:41,471
And I'm ready to die

3241
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:43,519
In fact

3242
02:56:50,431 --> 02:56:53,759
Unlimited data so I can show you hell I'm inside

3243
02:56:55,039 --> 02:56:56,063
I just got to figure

3244
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:59,391
There's no way to join them and get out of this

3245
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:02,463
The only thing you can do is resistant

3246
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:07,839
I told you that a discernment last-lap shows up that is fine. Right now you can't understand

3247
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:10,399
Championship

3248
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:15,007
Now there are those of us

3249
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:18,335
But have to stand in the gap

3250
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:35,487
Character side with your imagined

3251
02:57:35,743 --> 02:57:36,511
But I'm against

3252
02:57:38,815 --> 02:57:39,839
Pull himself off

3253
02:57:40,351 --> 02:57:40,863
Has like

3254
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:43,167
What if Obi-Wan Kenobi

3255
02:57:44,191 --> 02:57:45,471
Was Alex Jones

3256
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:50,079
It's like that the only corollary I can pick OB was racist

3257
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:53,919
What if what is Obi-Wan Kenobi in

3258
02:57:54,175 --> 02:57:56,735
Instead of being a wise Jedi Master

3259
02:57:56,991 --> 02:57:58,015
Who helped

3260
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:59,295
F****** the Empire would

3261
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:03,391
What if he instead was a f****** lunatic

3262
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:05,183
Lake Yosemite

3263
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:06,207
Damn in the desert

3264
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:12,607
What is a controlled opposition Draculaura Skywalker

3265
02:58:12,863 --> 02:58:14,399
False flag

3266
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:17,983
The best Star Wars movie

3267
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:23,359
You know

3268
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:24,639
Is is

3269
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:30,015
Is that

3270
02:58:30,783 --> 02:58:32,831
Like Alex is admitting operate off of

3271
02:58:33,855 --> 02:58:35,647
I only do this because I'm scared

3272
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:40,767
Performative but I think there's kernel of Truth

3273
02:58:43,583 --> 02:58:44,095
Feeder

3274
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,119
B drives

3275
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:50,239
And what are the problems that I have with that is that his fear is based on an imagined

3276
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:52,543
Right now this idea of these globalist

3277
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:53,311
Turn all this stuff

3278
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:55,615
When are you really break it down you start

3279
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:56,383
Horse Woody

3280
02:58:56,639 --> 02:58:57,407
He's talking about you look at

3281
02:58:57,663 --> 02:58:59,199
Get the documents that your references realized

3282
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:02,015
Look at like

3283
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:04,575
Did the things that are formative

3284
02:59:05,087 --> 02:59:08,415
Naked capitalist by skousen

3285
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,183
Conspiracy

3286
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:11,231
Right then you realize

3287
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,511
Crawfish it

3288
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:14,047
Communist

3289
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:15,839
Conspiracy theory bulshit

3290
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:17,119
From decades past

3291
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:19,935
It's all just warmed over

3292
02:59:20,191 --> 02:59:21,471
Protocols of the elders

3293
02:59:21,727 --> 02:59:23,519
Zion.

3294
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:25,055
Worked into a

3295
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:25,823
New framework

3296
02:59:26,591 --> 02:59:30,431
Directions and eyes in a way that is

3297
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:31,711
Resonated through the

3298
02:59:33,247 --> 02:59:35,295
Modern

3299
02:59:35,551 --> 02:59:37,599
Russian

3300
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:41,951
You you start

3301
02:59:42,207 --> 02:59:43,231
To recognize that

3302
02:59:43,487 --> 02:59:43,999
You start to think

3303
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:44,767
Think about it

3304
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:46,559
That's where Alex got the

3305
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:47,327
Conception

3306
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:50,399
Of these imagine

3307
02:59:51,167 --> 02:59:54,239
And you start to look at it a little bit

3308
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:55,263
A little bit too much

3309
02:59:55,775 --> 02:59:56,287
I know I

3310
02:59:56,799 --> 02:59:58,335
I try to practice radical MP

3311
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:00,895
With Alex

3312
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:01,663
The only way to go

3313
03:00:01,919 --> 03:00:02,431
Approached him

3314
03:00:02,943 --> 03:00:03,967
You don't deal with

3315
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:04,735
Exactly

3316
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:07,039
Things you say about a literal base

3317
03:00:07,295 --> 03:00:07,807
Right

3318
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:10,111
You deal with Insanity by bringing

3319
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:12,159
Acceptance of that insanity

3320
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:19,327
If you respond with anger

3321
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:21,119
You dismiss it you're also never go

3322
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:23,167
So when I

3323
03:00:23,935 --> 03:00:25,471
Like this I recognize

3324
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:26,239
What he saying

3325
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:29,823
There are these

3326
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:30,591
Demonic

3327
03:00:31,103 --> 03:00:33,151
Enemies that I have

3328
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:34,687
There are based on this misunderstanding

3329
03:00:34,943 --> 03:00:35,967
Understanding of History

3330
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:36,735
Was based on

3331
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:40,319
And when I sit with it a little bit longer

3332
03:00:40,831 --> 03:00:41,855
And I hear clip like that

3333
03:00:42,879 --> 03:00:44,671
I am motivated by fear

3334
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:47,743
It's hard for me not to

3335
03:00:47,999 --> 03:00:49,023
You think about

3336
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:50,047
Did

3337
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:52,351
Hugh

3338
03:00:52,863 --> 03:00:54,143
Encountered these ideas as a

3339
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:54,911
Child

3340
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,471
You got f****** terrified

3341
03:00:58,751 --> 03:00:59,775
But I don't

3342
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:01,055
I don't

3343
03:01:01,311 --> 03:01:02,591
Off the hook at all

3344
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:03,615
Like

3345
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:05,151
As much as that

3346
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:07,711
Sleep apnea brain damage stuff like

3347
03:01:08,223 --> 03:01:10,271
I'm not letting him off the hook for his ideas

3348
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:14,111
Just possibly his behavior is explained by that

3349
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:15,391
In the same way

3350
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:16,671
You look at this

3351
03:01:17,183 --> 03:01:18,975
The brain of a child could be

3352
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:21,023
Traumatized by the eye

3353
03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:23,839
Of this demonic World Force

3354
03:01:24,095 --> 03:01:26,911
That's against you and they have tendrils everywhere

3355
03:01:27,167 --> 03:01:27,935
The idea of a

3356
03:01:28,191 --> 03:01:28,703
12 year old

3357
03:01:28,959 --> 03:01:29,983
Find taking a

3358
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:31,519
This

3359
03:01:32,799 --> 03:01:36,639
Every single powerful entity is working against you

3360
03:01:36,895 --> 03:01:38,431
Commit genocide

3361
03:01:38,687 --> 03:01:39,967
All that stuff right

3362
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:41,503
There's a really decent chance

3363
03:01:42,015 --> 03:01:42,527
Book

3364
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:44,063
F***** his mind up

3365
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:45,599
And you've been living at me like a

3366
03:01:46,623 --> 03:01:47,647
Kind of states

3367
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:49,439
He operates off beer

3368
03:01:49,695 --> 03:01:50,719
Because of that

3369
03:01:50,975 --> 03:01:52,511
Child brain

3370
03:01:52,767 --> 03:01:54,815
Note that I have

3371
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:56,095
Occasionally

3372
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:57,119
Fourth on

3373
03:01:58,143 --> 03:02:00,191
Are we a true crime podcast

3374
03:02:00,703 --> 03:02:01,471
Do you know what I mean

3375
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:05,311
Like two are watching a serial

3376
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:09,151
We are tracing we probably killed

3377
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:13,503
Individual

3378
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:17,087
Art racing

3379
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:21,951
Facts

3380
03:02:24,255 --> 03:02:25,023
Have had

3381
03:02:27,839 --> 03:02:28,607
With some

3382
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:29,887
Like that

3383
03:02:30,143 --> 03:02:31,423
I feel like that is a layer

3384
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,983
The first layer is if

3385
03:02:34,495 --> 03:02:35,007
Literally

3386
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:35,775
He is afraid

3387
03:02:37,055 --> 03:02:37,823
Active layer is

3388
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:39,103
This is a performance

3389
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:40,127
He's not actually

3390
03:02:40,895 --> 03:02:42,687
But the bottom layer is

3391
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:44,735
Was

3392
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:45,759
Or is

3393
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:47,039
Actually friend

3394
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,343
Hiding this reality

3395
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:50,367
Like a try,

3396
03:02:51,135 --> 03:02:52,927
Yeah because what

3397
03:02:53,183 --> 03:02:53,695
Do you have

3398
03:02:57,023 --> 03:02:58,815
Like it it's just not

3399
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:01,631
Question becomes after

3400
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:09,567
Like going down that road though the further and further you get down that road the more you realize

3401
03:03:11,103 --> 03:03:12,639
This is just been

3402
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:19,039
And

3403
03:03:19,295 --> 03:03:25,439
No endpoint like no preparation WBEZ

3404
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:30,047
Care

3405
03:03:31,327 --> 03:03:32,351
I think that's really fun

3406
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:35,935
Volume

3407
03:03:37,471 --> 03:03:37,983
This is where

3408
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:43,615
This

3409
03:03:43,871 --> 03:03:45,151
This next to clip

3410
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:46,687
I think our

3411
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:47,967
Sofa

3412
03:03:48,991 --> 03:03:54,367
I'm saying it means you a resume

3413
03:03:56,159 --> 03:03:56,671
Fat

3414
03:03:56,927 --> 03:03:57,439
Eve

3415
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:58,207
Deeply

3416
03:03:58,719 --> 03:04:00,255
I believe it was Jesus

3417
03:04:00,511 --> 03:04:02,815
Who said Alex Jones would be the rock of the

3418
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:04,607
I believe that

3419
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:06,143
Alex Jones is the loads

3420
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:07,935
Stone who holds up the

3421
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:09,215
That sounds right

3422
03:04:09,727 --> 03:04:11,007
Like on a very basic

3423
03:04:11,263 --> 03:04:12,287
Level one

3424
03:04:13,823 --> 03:04:14,335
Icepeak

3425
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:15,359
For God

3426
03:04:17,407 --> 03:04:18,431
Then you resonate

3427
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:19,455
With God

3428
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:20,479
That's

3429
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:25,855
This isn't the political show man this is

3430
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:29,695
If it wasn't on the radio

3431
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:33,791
Is being said in a small room

3432
03:04:34,815 --> 03:04:37,375
If Anderson Cooper goes on TV and says

3433
03:04:37,631 --> 03:04:39,423
If you understand what I'm saying

3434
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:41,215
You understand what God is

3435
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:44,543
Holyshit entire world would f***

3436
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:46,079
Can you explode

3437
03:04:48,895 --> 03:04:49,407
Scene

3438
03:04:55,295 --> 03:04:56,575
When he was on

3439
03:04:56,831 --> 03:04:57,343
Social media

3440
03:05:00,415 --> 03:05:02,207
This is

3441
03:05:05,791 --> 03:05:06,559
Forgot

3442
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:11,423
Implies that

3443
03:05:11,679 --> 03:05:12,191
Infowars

3444
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:13,727
Forgot

3445
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:16,031
Decide which side you're on

3446
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:18,591
That's why this is all here

3447
03:05:19,103 --> 03:05:20,127
God made sure

3448
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:25,247
Platform in the last hour

3449
03:05:25,503 --> 03:05:26,527
Play shining we're here for you

3450
03:05:27,551 --> 03:05:28,063
We love you

3451
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:29,599
Inclusive

3452
03:05:31,647 --> 03:05:32,415
Don't go with Satan

3453
03:05:39,583 --> 03:05:40,607
The part about like

3454
03:05:40,863 --> 03:05:41,375
God

3455
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:44,447
Is going to provide platforms and

3456
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:48,799
That's crazy

3457
03:05:49,055 --> 03:05:53,919
The other the other like more ground part of it

3458
03:05:54,175 --> 03:05:55,967
That part is even crazier

3459
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:59,039
Because you can you can you can possibly side do you like

3460
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:01,599
God and delusions

3461
03:06:02,111 --> 03:06:03,647
Maniac

3462
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:05,439
He's like put that in a box

3463
03:06:05,951 --> 03:06:07,999
The idea that he thinks he's inclusive

3464
03:06:08,767 --> 03:06:09,535
So inexcusable

3465
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:11,071
Okay

3466
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:12,607
There is

3467
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:15,423
Just from a

3468
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:18,495
Literal definition

3469
03:06:19,007 --> 03:06:20,799
Inclusion does not miss

3470
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:21,823
Sara Lee

3471
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:24,383
Excuse

3472
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:27,199
Sure Limited

3473
03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:27,967
Conclusion

3474
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:32,575
But if your inclusion is only white people

3475
03:06:32,831 --> 03:06:33,599
Play Ura

3476
03:06:33,855 --> 03:06:34,367
Inclusive

3477
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:37,183
I should say before that clip he did say

3478
03:06:41,535 --> 03:06:47,679
As long as you are awake

3479
03:06:47,935 --> 03:06:49,727
It doesn't matter what skin color yet

3480
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:52,031
Or where you from

3481
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:53,055
He was trying

3482
03:06:53,311 --> 03:06:56,895
It up to that that that comment there

3483
03:06:57,151 --> 03:06:57,919
Wytheville you like

3484
03:06:59,455 --> 03:07:00,735
Whatever

3485
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:04,063
Standard boilerplate but I really don't think it's

3486
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:05,855
The fact that he said that

3487
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:07,647
That's why I didn't include in the cliff

3488
03:07:10,207 --> 03:07:11,487
No

3489
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:16,607
I don't care how we prefaces back

3490
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:17,631
Passivity is

3491
03:07:17,887 --> 03:07:19,167
Is so exclusive

3492
03:07:20,447 --> 03:07:24,543
It's the only good Islam is Christianity

3493
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:26,079
So Alex is getting into the

3494
03:07:26,335 --> 03:07:27,103
This really weird heads

3495
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:28,127
He's like

3496
03:07:28,639 --> 03:07:29,151
Icepeak

3497
03:07:29,407 --> 03:07:30,687
You forgot if you

3498
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:32,735
Listen to what I'm saying

3499
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:34,783
A boner

3500
03:07:35,551 --> 03:07:36,063
That's great

3501
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:37,599
And then also God

3502
03:07:37,855 --> 03:07:38,879
Is made it so

3503
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:39,903
There will be

3504
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:40,671
Places

3505
03:07:40,927 --> 03:07:42,463
Where you can come

3506
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:44,511
Until the last days and that's me

3507
03:07:44,767 --> 03:07:45,279
That's awesome

3508
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:46,303
That's what we're doing

3509
03:07:46,815 --> 03:07:48,607
We are an outpost section

3510
03:07:48,863 --> 03:07:49,375
Buy guide

3511
03:07:49,887 --> 03:07:50,911
Which is really

3512
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:52,703
Really deeply f***** up

3513
03:07:53,215 --> 03:07:54,239
And we have one more clip

3514
03:07:54,495 --> 03:07:56,543
I want to be clear this last

3515
03:07:58,335 --> 03:07:59,615
Straits entirely with Alex

3516
03:08:00,127 --> 03:08:00,639
Entire Opera

3517
03:08:01,919 --> 03:08:04,991
I wouldn't we enjoy these sort of like weird esoteric

3518
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:05,759
Dalliance

3519
03:08:07,295 --> 03:08:08,063
It's important

3520
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:09,599
Realize why there's

3521
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:10,367
Is there

3522
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:13,439
I meant also realize that Alex

3523
03:08:14,719 --> 03:08:15,743
I mean there's indications

3524
03:08:15,999 --> 03:08:17,023
Struggling to

3525
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:18,047
But he's struggling

3526
03:08:20,607 --> 03:08:23,167
When you struggling with that are

3527
03:08:23,423 --> 03:08:23,935
Realizing

3528
03:08:25,215 --> 03:08:25,727
Created

3529
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:28,287
Is on like Roblox

3530
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:32,895
Is a full demonstration of like

3531
03:08:33,407 --> 03:08:34,687
Where is that like fun in

3532
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:36,479
Interesting esoteric nonsense

3533
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:37,759
Pivots back

3534
03:08:38,271 --> 03:08:38,783
The real world

3535
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:40,575
It's the same thing when he's faking

3536
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:42,111
Crying

3537
03:08:43,135 --> 03:08:44,415
It's always

3538
03:08:44,927 --> 03:08:45,439
Something that he

3539
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:46,975
Marginally in

3540
03:08:47,231 --> 03:08:47,999
Controller

3541
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:51,583
Operation

3542
03:08:53,887 --> 03:08:55,679
Protect into it and actually

3543
03:08:56,191 --> 03:08:57,983
Look at it I do it

3544
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:04,383
Complaining

3545
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:07,199
I really should

3546
03:09:07,455 --> 03:09:09,247
Looking

3547
03:09:15,391 --> 03:09:18,207
It's really horrible.

3548
03:09:18,719 --> 03:09:22,047
You see what they're doing the kids and everybody Associates

3549
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:25,119
Trump

3550
03:09:26,911 --> 03:09:33,055
I'll do what I speak on all I'm telling you is we need your prayers with your support now

3551
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:35,359
This is it

3552
03:09:35,871 --> 03:09:37,151
Fishes the big plush

3553
03:09:37,407 --> 03:09:40,735
Planet planet

3554
03:09:42,783 --> 03:09:43,295
Spirit

3555
03:09:43,807 --> 03:09:46,111
Divide those up from good for the bat

3556
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:48,671
Quest

3557
03:09:49,183 --> 03:09:52,511
I'm just very blessed

3558
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:55,583
Talk to you

3559
03:09:56,607 --> 03:09:59,423
How are you have a shot at you you're focused

3560
03:10:00,959 --> 03:10:03,263
You understand potential you have

3561
03:10:03,775 --> 03:10:07,871
Ashley support us

3562
03:10:08,383 --> 03:10:10,175
Boo

3563
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:12,479
You see

3564
03:10:13,247 --> 03:10:14,527
He's in control of that

3565
03:10:15,807 --> 03:10:17,599
Sing a bunch of s***

3566
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:18,879
A bunch of nonsense

3567
03:10:19,903 --> 03:10:25,535
It's funny he's getting esoteric

3568
03:10:25,791 --> 03:10:29,887
Quest we're on destruction of our very planet

3569
03:10:30,911 --> 03:10:32,959
The hinges on Rodger stones

3570
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:34,495
Somehow

3571
03:10:36,287 --> 03:10:42,431
Because he's able to weave it forward

3572
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:44,991
It's like yeah you have to financially support

3573
03:10:45,503 --> 03:10:47,295
He hasn't add pivot out of

3574
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:50,367
Deeper esoteric nonsense

3575
03:10:50,623 --> 03:10:56,511
Kind of like I'm going to look into the enemy's mind I try to but it's it's

3576
03:10:58,047 --> 03:10:58,815
Maybe tonight

3577
03:10:59,071 --> 03:11:01,119
And he's still doing the exact same voice

3578
03:11:01,375 --> 03:11:03,423
He's doing in that weird esoteric breakdown

3579
03:11:03,679 --> 03:11:04,703
When you get that you like

3580
03:11:04,959 --> 03:11:07,007
You have to give us support

3581
03:11:07,263 --> 03:11:09,055
Financial

3582
03:11:09,311 --> 03:11:10,591
The battle is now

3583
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:11,871
And so

3584
03:11:12,127 --> 03:11:12,639
I know

3585
03:11:13,151 --> 03:11:14,175
Break myself away from

3586
03:11:14,687 --> 03:11:15,199
Optical

3587
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:16,479
Ideas about

3588
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:21,343
I don't know just it anyway feeling sorry

3589
03:11:22,367 --> 03:11:24,159
Because when you see stuff like that

3590
03:11:26,719 --> 03:11:28,255
There's there's nothing

3591
03:11:28,767 --> 03:11:29,535
He's not into

3592
03:11:29,791 --> 03:11:30,303
Tensional

3593
03:11:30,815 --> 03:11:33,375
About how he's using his f*****-up

3594
03:11:33,887 --> 03:11:37,727
I don't think there's anything wrong about you and I

3595
03:11:38,239 --> 03:11:40,031
Taking time out of our day

3596
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:42,079
To wrestle with a possibility

3597
03:11:42,591 --> 03:11:43,871
That were wrong in Mockingjay

3598
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:48,991
That clip was going on I was getting back

3599
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:50,783
Today's like weave

3600
03:11:51,295 --> 03:11:52,063
So many times

3601
03:11:53,599 --> 03:11:54,111
And this is he

3602
03:11:56,415 --> 03:11:56,927
Truly

3603
03:11:57,183 --> 03:11:57,951
Even while we

3604
03:11:58,975 --> 03:11:59,487
Gears

3605
03:11:59,999 --> 03:12:00,511
Secting all the

3606
03:12:00,767 --> 03:12:01,279
Dumb

3607
03:12:03,839 --> 03:12:04,607
Proving

3608
03:12:05,631 --> 03:12:08,959
Wallows listen if I was kind of halfway

3609
03:12:10,751 --> 03:12:11,263
Really

3610
03:12:12,287 --> 03:12:13,055
Is this all

3611
03:12:14,847 --> 03:12:15,871
What is

3612
03:12:17,919 --> 03:12:18,431
We need your

3613
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:19,967
Support your like that

3614
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,735
That's it

3615
03:12:24,831 --> 03:12:25,855
Is trying to defend Rodger

3616
03:12:26,111 --> 03:12:26,623
Obviously

3617
03:12:26,879 --> 03:12:27,903
He doesn't want any

3618
03:12:28,159 --> 03:12:34,303
Mostly primarily concerned with

3619
03:12:37,631 --> 03:12:42,239
Yep

3620
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:45,823
It's kind of pissing me off and then as The Show Goes On

3621
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:46,591
You loses

3622
03:12:46,847 --> 03:12:47,871
How to the f****** audience

3623
03:12:48,127 --> 03:12:50,175
Cuz like he's not really even talked about any Rogers

3624
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:59,647
Weird f****** place 3 says that he speaks for God and Infowars and outpost

3625
03:12:59,903 --> 03:13:00,927
Forgot

3626
03:13:01,183 --> 03:13:01,951
Getting to the enemies

3627
03:13:02,975 --> 03:13:03,743
Painful but it's

3628
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:05,279
Really just away

3629
03:13:05,791 --> 03:13:06,303
Continue what is the

3630
03:13:06,559 --> 03:13:07,327
You do the whole show

3631
03:13:07,583 --> 03:13:08,863
Which is try and get people to

3632
03:13:09,119 --> 03:13:10,143
To give him more money

3633
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:12,447
Because he's making less money than

3634
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:13,983
Yep so

3635
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:15,007
F*** all of this

3636
03:13:16,287 --> 03:13:17,567
I meant to say at the end

3637
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:18,591
My summation

3638
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:19,615
I think

3639
03:13:19,871 --> 03:13:20,895
First of all

3640
03:13:21,919 --> 03:13:23,455
My point clearly Rodger Stone

3641
03:13:23,711 --> 03:13:24,479
The indictments

3642
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:28,319
Pretty open-and-shut

3643
03:13:28,575 --> 03:13:30,879
In the future talking about course

3644
03:13:31,135 --> 03:13:32,415
Free stuff

3645
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:33,695
Information is available

3646
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:34,719
Right now

3647
03:13:35,231 --> 03:13:36,511
I don't think there's enough for us

3648
03:13:36,767 --> 03:13:37,791
Position on it

3649
03:13:38,047 --> 03:13:38,559
Although if I

3650
03:13:42,143 --> 03:13:46,239
I would bet that corsi

3651
03:13:46,495 --> 03:13:47,775
Is probably

3652
03:13:48,031 --> 03:13:48,543
Cooperating

3653
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:49,823
Substantial way

3654
03:13:50,079 --> 03:13:51,871
And there might be a lot of information

3655
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:56,479
I think

3656
03:13:56,735 --> 03:13:58,783
Yeah sure

3657
03:13:59,039 --> 03:14:00,319
It's probably over

3658
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:01,087
Trusted

3659
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:03,647
In that world and also

3660
03:14:05,951 --> 03:14:07,743
It took forever to break

3661
03:14:07,999 --> 03:14:08,511
Manafort

3662
03:14:09,279 --> 03:14:11,327
When the FBI called courses

3663
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:14,143
He was like you're the FBI I will tell you

3664
03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:15,679
Literally everything

3665
03:14:15,935 --> 03:14:16,959
Right now over the

3666
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:18,239
The phone I don't even

3667
03:14:18,495 --> 03:14:21,823
Manafort manafort

3668
03:14:24,127 --> 03:14:25,151
Literally has worked

3669
03:14:25,407 --> 03:14:25,919
Dictator

3670
03:14:26,687 --> 03:14:27,711
Like murderers

3671
03:14:28,223 --> 03:14:30,015
He has lobbied for

3672
03:14:30,271 --> 03:14:31,551
Gotten paychecks for

3673
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:32,319
Blood

3674
03:14:32,831 --> 03:14:33,599
He knows that

3675
03:14:34,111 --> 03:14:35,135
You have done that

3676
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:36,159
Rodger

3677
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:38,207
Known

3678
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:39,487
That's their business

3679
03:14:40,255 --> 03:14:41,023
Is built on

3680
03:14:41,535 --> 03:14:43,839
The death of people in other countries

3681
03:14:44,607 --> 03:14:46,399
Peace with that

3682
03:14:48,959 --> 03:14:49,727
Hundreds

3683
03:14:49,983 --> 03:14:51,519
100 and hundreds of

3684
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:52,799
Thousand

3685
03:14:53,311 --> 03:14:55,359
And yes absolutely

3686
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:58,943
Like the things that

3687
03:14:59,199 --> 03:15:02,015
Even just a year in in Philippi

3688
03:15:02,271 --> 03:15:02,783
Yeah

3689
03:15:04,831 --> 03:15:07,391
The specifics of what

3690
03:15:07,647 --> 03:15:08,927
Those people were doing

3691
03:15:09,183 --> 03:15:10,975
Contracted by their fur

3692
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:13,279
Like if unfit

3693
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:14,047
Speakable stuff

3694
03:15:14,303 --> 03:15:15,583
Lake Burton

3695
03:15:16,351 --> 03:15:17,631
Legitimately had a policy

3696
03:15:17,887 --> 03:15:18,655
In place where

3697
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:19,679
What he would like

3698
03:15:19,935 --> 03:15:21,215
To do is he would take

3699
03:15:21,983 --> 03:15:22,751
And then he would

3700
03:15:23,007 --> 03:15:23,519
Disfigured

3701
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:27,103
And kill them

3702
03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:29,919
I didn't leave their bodies in the open for people

3703
03:15:30,175 --> 03:15:30,687
Find

3704
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:32,223
In order for them to find it

3705
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:33,247
Terrified

3706
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:35,295
About this is what happened

3707
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:36,575
Rodger Stone

3708
03:15:37,087 --> 03:15:37,599
He's firm

3709
03:15:37,855 --> 03:15:40,159
Still were fine taking their money

3710
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:43,231
Disorders like

3711
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:46,559
Real distillation of the brutality

3712
03:15:46,815 --> 03:15:48,607
Oh people Rodger Stones comfortable work

3713
03:15:48,863 --> 03:15:53,471
Is it supposed as ice water in their f******

3714
03:15:54,495 --> 03:15:55,263
They don't give a s***

3715
03:15:55,519 --> 03:15:56,287
Yep like

3716
03:15:56,543 --> 03:15:57,055
Bait Wilkes

3717
03:15:57,311 --> 03:15:58,079
Protect their ass

3718
03:15:58,335 --> 03:15:59,615
Is best

3719
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:02,175
Is there

3720
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:04,735
A courtroom or smaller is talking to

3721
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:06,783
They have face

3722
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:09,087
People who have murdered

3723
03:16:09,343 --> 03:16:10,111
Thousands of people

3724
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:13,951
Say some experience with that high-pressure situation

3725
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:15,231
Course it is written

3726
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:17,023
Bailey

3727
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:20,095
Coursey Road of bulshit book

3728
03:16:20,351 --> 03:16:22,399
About Obama not being a citizen

3729
03:16:22,655 --> 03:16:23,423
Yeah like

3730
03:16:23,679 --> 03:16:25,215
Poses like someone who's like

3731
03:16:25,471 --> 03:16:26,751
I have all these contacts

3732
03:16:28,543 --> 03:16:29,055
Whatever

3733
03:16:29,823 --> 03:16:31,871
He's not made of the strong stuff

3734
03:16:32,127 --> 03:16:33,407
And I'm not saying that is positive

3735
03:16:33,919 --> 03:16:35,199
That manafort and stone are

3736
03:16:35,711 --> 03:16:36,479
They have been

3737
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:38,271
Mixed up with people

3738
03:16:38,527 --> 03:16:39,039
Who

3739
03:16:40,319 --> 03:16:42,111
Are much more dangerous

3740
03:16:42,367 --> 03:16:43,647
Then even the United

3741
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:45,183
Judicial

3742
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:48,511
Joe Arpaio

3743
03:16:51,583 --> 03:16:53,631
Because you went through line-by-line

3744
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:56,959
Same number of

3745
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:57,983
Torturous

3746
03:16:58,495 --> 03:16:59,263
Murderous

3747
03:16:59,775 --> 03:17:01,567
F****** b*******

3748
03:17:04,639 --> 03:17:05,919
Arpaio is a

3749
03:17:06,175 --> 03:17:06,687
Truman

3750
03:17:07,455 --> 03:17:08,223
Absolutely

3751
03:17:08,991 --> 03:17:10,015
Rodger Stone

3752
03:17:10,527 --> 03:17:11,295
And Pullman

3753
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:13,855
Himmler

3754
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:16,927
Many

3755
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:17,951
Dictators

3756
03:17:18,207 --> 03:17:20,511
Like even Himmler was just

3757
03:17:22,815 --> 03:17:24,863
Only one dictator

3758
03:17:25,119 --> 03:17:31,263
Call Marie cell.

3759
03:17:33,823 --> 03:17:34,335
Because

3760
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:42,527
Rodger Stone

3761
03:17:42,783 --> 03:17:46,367
Images like I'm a f****** dirty trickster whatever

3762
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:49,695
And I think that it's so important to draw a line

3763
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:50,975
Like

3764
03:17:51,231 --> 03:17:53,279
What is the fun image

3765
03:17:53,535 --> 03:17:54,303
And the reality

3766
03:17:54,559 --> 03:17:55,839
Because it's different

3767
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:56,607
It's different

3768
03:17:56,863 --> 03:17:58,655
Like he's like

3769
03:17:58,911 --> 03:18:00,191
Like back when he works for

3770
03:18:00,703 --> 03:18:01,215
Bucking Nixon

3771
03:18:01,471 --> 03:18:03,263
Re-election campaign

3772
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:04,287
Impatience

3773
03:18:04,543 --> 03:18:05,055
The Democrats

3774
03:18:05,311 --> 03:18:07,871
Do a fake dinner

3775
03:18:08,383 --> 03:18:10,175
You like that sort of stuff like okay

3776
03:18:10,431 --> 03:18:11,199
Cool

3777
03:18:11,455 --> 03:18:12,991
You were also involved in Watergate

3778
03:18:19,135 --> 03:18:20,671
Let's do it it's cantankerous

3779
03:18:20,927 --> 03:18:22,719
That's not who he is Benson

3780
03:18:23,231 --> 03:18:24,255
And it's not being who

3781
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:25,535
Has been

3782
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:27,327
The f****** age

3783
03:18:28,095 --> 03:18:32,959
I mean there's a ton of people who are involved with Infowars that we could do an episode that would be like

3784
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:33,983
Gave

3785
03:18:35,775 --> 03:18:37,055
And just because it's

3786
03:18:37,311 --> 03:18:38,335
Knock the most

3787
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,615
Pressing thing ever

3788
03:18:42,687 --> 03:18:43,711
Wow we just got to keep

3789
03:18:43,967 --> 03:18:47,807
Process moving Roberts

3790
03:18:48,063 --> 03:18:49,343
Yeah

3791
03:18:49,599 --> 03:18:50,111
Histories

3792
03:18:51,135 --> 03:18:52,415
F***** up things that they've done

3793
03:18:54,719 --> 03:19:00,351
We will do a whole episode

3794
03:19:01,887 --> 03:19:03,167
Is that he is no joke

3795
03:19:05,215 --> 03:19:05,727
End.

3796
03:19:08,287 --> 03:19:11,615
Him as if he's a monster in a fun way

3797
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:14,431
Well it's

3798
03:19:14,687 --> 03:19:15,455
8

3799
03:19:15,711 --> 03:19:16,479
One of those things

3800
03:19:16,735 --> 03:19:17,247
Kingswear

3801
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:20,575
And this is

3802
03:19:20,831 --> 03:19:22,367
Is the hard part of

3803
03:19:23,135 --> 03:19:24,159
Your morality

3804
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:25,695
If you want to go with

3805
03:19:29,279 --> 03:19:30,815
When you talk about the dick

3806
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:31,839
Haters that they suck

3807
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:33,631
Sure

3808
03:19:34,143 --> 03:19:34,655
Tortured

3809
03:19:36,191 --> 03:19:36,959
Hundreds of

3810
03:19:39,519 --> 03:19:40,031
Never

3811
03:19:41,311 --> 03:19:41,823
End

3812
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:42,591
Shouldn't

3813
03:19:42,847 --> 03:19:43,359
Have happened

3814
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:45,151
It should never have happened

3815
03:19:45,407 --> 03:19:46,431
No matter what

3816
03:19:46,687 --> 03:19:48,735
But somehow there are people

3817
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:51,039
Truly done enough

3818
03:19:52,575 --> 03:19:53,599
Deserve that

3819
03:19:54,623 --> 03:19:55,647
And they will never

3820
03:19:55,903 --> 03:19:56,671
Ever ever

3821
03:19:58,207 --> 03:19:59,231
Lego

3822
03:19:59,487 --> 03:20:00,255
I don't care

3823
03:20:00,511 --> 03:20:02,815
I don't care as far as look Rodger

3824
03:20:03,071 --> 03:20:03,583
Stone

3825
03:20:03,839 --> 03:20:04,863
Deserves

3826
03:20:05,375 --> 03:20:06,143
The worst

3827
03:20:06,399 --> 03:20:06,911
Of what

3828
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:09,983
I hope he gets a you know

3829
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:12,543
Federal Prison

3830
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:13,823
Where are the states

3831
03:20:14,591 --> 03:20:15,359
Survive for the rectum

3832
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:16,127
Is life

3833
03:20:18,687 --> 03:20:20,735
So Jordan we're at the end of episode we're done

3834
03:20:22,015 --> 03:20:24,063
I don't I don't know I think

3835
03:20:25,343 --> 03:20:28,415
I'm exhausted I don't know how to summon this up

3836
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:29,951
Rogers screwed

3837
03:20:30,207 --> 03:20:31,231
We'll see what happens

3838
03:20:31,743 --> 03:20:33,535
Corsi stuff will play out over the next

3839
03:20:34,815 --> 03:20:35,327
We'll see I don't know

3840
03:20:35,839 --> 03:20:36,351
8

3841
03:20:36,607 --> 03:20:38,399
I would like you to some this up because

3842
03:20:39,935 --> 03:20:41,983
Okay

3843
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:43,007
Bestest on this up

3844
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:43,775
As well as I can

3845
03:20:45,311 --> 03:20:45,823
Stone is 5

3846
03:20:46,847 --> 03:20:47,359
Corsi's

3847
03:20:48,895 --> 03:20:49,407
Everybody's

3848
03:20:50,687 --> 03:20:51,199
Somehow

3849
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:52,479
Alex

3850
03:20:53,503 --> 03:20:54,527
Not f***** in the same

3851
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:55,295
What

3852
03:20:55,551 --> 03:20:56,063
And I think

3853
03:20:56,319 --> 03:20:57,087
He is broke

3854
03:21:00,159 --> 03:21:00,671
Go to prison

3855
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:03,743
Like and I think that is both something

3856
03:21:04,255 --> 03:21:05,023
He is jealous

3857
03:21:05,535 --> 03:21:07,583
As well as something

3858
03:21:07,839 --> 03:21:08,351
Sulphur

3859
03:21:09,119 --> 03:21:10,143
Send it

3860
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:11,167
Place for him

3861
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:12,703
So for him

3862
03:21:13,471 --> 03:21:13,983
Do an epic

3863
03:21:15,519 --> 03:21:16,287
He is watching

3864
03:21:17,311 --> 03:21:18,079
People become

3865
03:21:19,103 --> 03:21:19,615
Murder

3866
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:21,151
In their own mind

3867
03:21:21,919 --> 03:21:22,943
In a real way

3868
03:21:23,711 --> 03:21:26,271
And bumped him out because he is a martyr

3869
03:21:27,039 --> 03:21:28,831
Steakway

3870
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:29,599
But he's not getting

3871
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:32,927
Exclusive with Joan Park so

3872
03:21:36,767 --> 03:21:37,279
His bottom line

3873
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:40,863
Interested

3874
03:21:41,375 --> 03:21:43,423
He's concerned that no one's giving him credit for

3875
03:21:43,679 --> 03:21:44,959
You got arrested

3876
03:21:45,983 --> 03:21:46,495
I wouldn't

3877
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:48,287
Come on the podcast doing emerge

3878
03:21:48,543 --> 03:21:49,311
Episode

3879
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:51,871
Hey Jordans on the phone hey Jordan has gone

3880
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:53,919
I've been doing interviews

3881
03:21:54,175 --> 03:21:55,455
F****** 40 minutes be like

3882
03:21:56,223 --> 03:21:56,735
No one is Rekha

3883
03:21:58,015 --> 03:21:58,783
Two Georges

3884
03:21:59,039 --> 03:22:01,855
But that's a weird impulse

3885
03:22:03,391 --> 03:22:03,903
It's a

3886
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:06,463
Perfectly logical impulse

3887
03:22:06,719 --> 03:22:07,743
For their religion

3888
03:22:07,999 --> 03:22:09,791
Kinship as both of them being Psychopaths

3889
03:22:10,047 --> 03:22:11,327
Because Rodger

3890
03:22:11,583 --> 03:22:12,863
Was on the phone with

3891
03:22:13,119 --> 03:22:13,631

F****** bailed I don't get no with no like Da Costa.

3893

Alex's on errands

3895
03:22:27,199 --> 03:22:28,223
We should take

3896
03:22:29,503 --> 03:22:30,015
Mustang

3897
03:22:30,271 --> 03:22:30,783

3898
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:36,159

Twice

3900
03:22:37,951 --> 03:22:42,047
Infowars orbit

3901
03:22:43,071 --> 03:22:43,583
Million

3902
03:22:43,839 --> 03:22:46,143
And most the time to donate stones

3903
03:22:46,399 --> 03:22:47,935
Fundies also then

03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:49,471
Into like we also

3905
03:22:52,543 --> 03:22:53,567
It's two parasites

3906
03:22:54,079 --> 03:22:55,871
Sucking off each other's stomachs

3907
03:22:56,127 --> 03:22:58,175
Untenable like unsustainable

3908
03:22:58,431 --> 03:22:58,943
Situation

3909
03:22:59,199 --> 03:23:00,735
I don't know we'll see what happens

3910
