1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Alex

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
Joan

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
King of the Road

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
How you doing

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,848
Better than you

10
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,712
You need it

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
My bright spot is last night I went to cysk

12
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Would you are an alumnus

13
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,256
Sure you ask me to Meredith

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,400
I hosted a couple times

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,752
Redefined what it means to debut at zysk

16
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,128
Regenerist Recovery album by Drake

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
I think that's just cuz I ran the light accidentally by like

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
Twilight 3 minutes

19
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
I got to see Marty DeRosa the aforementioned hehehe

20
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't stand up in a long time

21
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
First time up in forever and I

22
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Can't believe how Hardy Crush days great was ridiculous Kristen to me

23
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,032
Since I started comedy years ago

24
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
Amazing I love her she was

25
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Awesome

26
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
It's just

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Great to see him

28
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
Fun my car got towed

29
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
And I walked around

30
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
Downtown Chicago until about 1 a.m.

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Just got on

32
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
The trade-in what

33
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Yeah that's fine but there's no resolution

34
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
We're awesome when your car gets towed you stumble around trying to

35
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
Get out of lockup and I give up

36
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
And then I was like I'm not going to do this tonight

37
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032
Not going to happen that does suck I know that like it's

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
It's not good

39
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
Experience Xavier car towed anywhere

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,224
But I think in Chicago with a particularly miserable.

41
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
No it's the worst

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,136
I've never had a car while they lift yourself never had to suffer this but I've been around

43
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
A number of people who have that fate has befallen them

44
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
And yes

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,144
Bad news the first time I lived in Chicago when I was 19 I had my car towed and

46
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
It was about 1 a.m. my cousin had already gone to sleep I'd walked about two miles to his

47
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Consciously

48
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
So I had to walk another three-and-a-half miles back

49
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Back to my place

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Is Not Great there's a bad night

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Is bad night sounds pretty bad

52
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Don't don't

53
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Get your car towed in Chicago

54
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,928
Anyways with your wife

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,512
Stuff I can't really get into yet by project

56
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,144
Be kind of stuff maybe coming down the road but I feel like that's teasing and not appropriate

57
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
My bright spot is my car didn't get towed

58
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
Just having a little fun

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,000
2022 extreme

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Zuppardi's very scared

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
About that stuff and that it really blows up in his face

62
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
I'm excited to get into it

63
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Let's take a little over to say hello.

64
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Somebody walks that's great idea

65
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Do first

66
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
Tallest purple

67
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Knowledge fight for 50% off at my pillow.

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
Is Mike Lindell really did want to f*** with us that would be a good way for him to do it

69
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,303
There's actually a dad

70
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,191
We don't own two words X's the books that burn podcast currently reading River of

71
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
Teeth by Sarah Gailey thank you so much you're now about

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,871
Thank you very much I had to do that

73
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Is the otherwise it wouldn't

74
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Currently

75
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
That's true

76
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
That's true

77
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
We got to take Amtrak to the mixture

78
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
Never realize how to Alex's

79
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Technocrat

80
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
I have

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Risen above

82
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
A little breaking for me

83
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
And then we're going

84
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
To come back

85
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
And I'm going to

86
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Start the show over

87
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
F*** you

88
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
I got plenty work for you but

89
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
At the end of the day

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
F*** you and your new world order

91
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
She wrote in on

92
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
And all your s***

93
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

94
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
I'll walk out of here tomorrow

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
And you never see me again

96
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Really what I want to do

97
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Back here again

98
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Apologized

99
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
To the crew in the western Chester

100
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

101
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Better tomorrow

102
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
He may be better he may not be

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
I appreciate

104
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
One thing about that

105
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Drop more than any other witches

106
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Is Dan you have broken

107
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Both mine

108
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
And every other policy wonks brain

109
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Because I cannot get away from

110
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Take a little break a little break easy

111
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Breakout video

112
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
I'll take a little break

113
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,663
Vomiting

114
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Brutal

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Your drops have

116
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,807
Broken the brains of many of many of of walk I'm just doing my part

117
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Appreciate it

118
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Alex

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,511
Has a overarching narrative on this show

120
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,399
And this is before Alex's actual show bumper starts

121
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
He's just muttering over

122
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
So here's how we begin

123
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,615
Ladies and gentlemen this is a Maxima Red Alert

124
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Worldwide thermonuclear war

125
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,159
Meadowlark maximum alert TuneIn now for the word Infowars the most banned Network

126
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
In the world

127
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,583
So that's the sting and then it goes into his bumper and he starts the show so that is that how you know this is

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
Sirius total thermonuclear war

129
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Infowars

130
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Either worsens there were some comments that Putin made after his press conference races in the Press

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,967
After his meeting with Emmanuel macron recently

132
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,551
Some talk of moving to missiles and what have you

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
This may be interpreted as a direct

134
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Threat of nuclear war in escalation but

135
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
You know either way

136
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
It's not great

137
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
I think Alex might be a little

138
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
The Buckwild on this

139
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
It's important to understand

140
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Any kind of threat

141
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,239
That Russia may be making Visa V discussing their nuclear capabilities

142
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
In the context of political history

143
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Does Putin that his administration do this

144
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
A lot

145
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Them to exist

146
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,271
2014 foreign minister Sergei lavrov

147
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
I'm against Ukraine if they tried to take back for me yet

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
In 2007 they warn Poland of the Czech Republic that they could

149
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
Still nuke them even with Western anti-missile defenses

150
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
Attempt to dissuade the countries from letting the US

151
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
In their country

152
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
This happens a lot

153
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
And there's a pretty simple

154
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,079
It's one of the very few pieces of Leverage that Putin in Russia actually have at their disposal to

155
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
To use

156
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
And because of that it's become a state policy to use threats of nuclear war in order to

157
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Deescalate situation

158
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
It couldn't be the acolyte D escalated otherwise

159
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
So I came to power in 2000

160
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
And shortly after that that April he put in place a new military Doctrine which replaced

161
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
The previous doctor and they did have been put in

162
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Ian 1993

163
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
What are the main

164
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,287
Pieces that's relevant to us now is that in the original version nuclear arms could only be used

165
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
Quote in case

166
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Of a threat to the existence of the Russia

167
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Confederation

168
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
The new version

169
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,759
Expanded this tool a further use quote in response to large-scale aggression

170
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Utilizing

171
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Conventional Weapons

172
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
In situations critical to the National Security of the Russia

173
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Confederation

174
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
They opened it up a little bit

175
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Which is what you want from nuclear

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Consolidation

177
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
The former head of Poland's National Security Bureau status

178
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
In practice

179
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
An article from Politico Europe

180
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
The numerous events of Russian nuclear blackmailing add up to the Russian strategy of information

181
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Warfare which aims to intimidate the West

182
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Enable Russia to reconstructed

183
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Soviet Union

184
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
ER Tech

185
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
Right and also its

186
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
A bluff

187
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
But

188
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
It's not one that you ever want to risk

189
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
Calling all the fun

190
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Don't f*** with that Bluffs

191
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
Speak on the matter of you this as a propaganda

192
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:20,799
Because ultimately this nuclear deterrence also exists within the nuclear deterrence that many NATO countries

193
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Also have

194
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Nuclear capability

195
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Goes both ways

196
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,503
And Russian knows that if they were to actually use those nukes at their posturing like they're going to

197
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
The responsible Swift

198
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Devastating

199
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
For all part

200
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
Their ultimate goal of protecting the Russian Federation

201
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Confirm

202
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Reserved

203
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Provide the Russian Federation getting

204
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,375
The goal can be served by threatening to use on that threat being enough to intimidate

205
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
And change the behaviors of NATO

206
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
And the countries in the region that wish to join it

207
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Situation

208
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
But it's important to recognize a little Alex engages with any of this s***

209
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Pumas Ebony's going to move some missiles

210
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Perhaps

211
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
Alex starts his Joe do this grotesque movie trailer voice

212
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Thermonuclear war

213
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
When you recognize that

214
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
These threats the Putin is

215
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Is deploying or part of his information Warfare strategy

216
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,351
You have to realize that all Alex's doing it either wittingly or unwittingly amplifying and playing right now

217
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Into that strata

218
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,751
The more of this thread is hyped the greater the chance of forcing an 80d escalation and

219
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Capitulation

220
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
To Putin's demands

221
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Then again the world

222
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Completely insane

223
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
2022 and many things that would have been

224
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
By conventional wisdom of the past 20 years as being to being a possible

225
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Anymore

226
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
So I don't want

227
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Entirely downplay this

228
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Situation

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
The point I want to make is just that if Alex were half the geopolitical

230
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
He pretends to be

231
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
He wouldn't engage with this

232
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Piece of news this way

233
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
Right

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Are you going to get really extreme with

235
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
I mean I think it's

236
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Probably a bad idea

237
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
That's just because I've never seen total nuclear war before so maybe there are some positives that I

238
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
I haven't considered you know I've lived through one

239
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Yeah

240
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,647
I think that Alex really likes to use the Specter of that possibility as like a way to

241
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Excite people

242
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
Come on baby let's get it up

243
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
So Alex has this

244
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Story about poop

245
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
And he has a sorcerer

246
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Actually isn't

247
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Bratz

248
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
The source

249
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Isn't

250
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
The Daily Mail art

251
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Okay

252
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
That's worried start

253
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
Brown's it's so much more digging on this thing man

254
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
We'll see

255
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
All right here we are on the edge of thermonuclear war

256
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
This this morning

257
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Daily Mail

258
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
I had trouble believing it

259
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
So I went and searched

260
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Some of the quotes

261
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,311
Nowhere else can the Western news

262
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Spend some time

263
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Found it in Russian

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,551
Translated and indeed we found a version that has subtitles

265
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Vladimir

266
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
President of Russia has threatened nuclear war

267
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
And said within the blinking of an eye

268
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
He says you won't have time to Blink

269
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Your eye

270
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,983
You've NATO continues its Article 5 takeover I got the clothes right here on the video

271
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Proxy war

272
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
You're going to

273
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Basically

274
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Stop

275
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
But basically is in there

276
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
So Alex is trying to pretend that he did all this leg work

277
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,367
In the crew dug up and found until about this Putin speech

278
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Spoiler alert

279
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
That's all bulshit

280
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
Eventually Alex plays this translation that they supposedly came up with

281
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,375
That's just a literally the video that's embedded in the Daily Mail article

282
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
Even has the Daily Mail logo on

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
You know they got it from Russia

284
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,687
Alex's is reading the subtitles to veteran that discount

285
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
What a

286
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
What a dick

287
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
He's pretending to work on this story because he wants to create the impression that he has access to information that the rest of the world

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
The media doesn't have access to or

289
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Choosing not

290
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
What to talk about

291
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
Exactly you can really easily find it English translation of this entire speech to the Putin gave us

292
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
The kremlin's website

293
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Announces version is

294
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Is just the daily male version

295
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
It

296
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
Really match the claims even that he's making

297
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
It still doesn't match up

298
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
I just like hearing that the

299
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Kremlin has a website

300
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Isn't that kind of silly like in your brain

301
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
I think most

302
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
Government pository

303
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
I don't know

304
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,303
I don't I don't know

305
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
Sure at least it's not like a blogs

306
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Traveling. Substack

307
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
11

308
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,687
Because there's a new shut-off

309
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
Isn't really accurate to the transcript provided by the Kremlin

310
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
There is a reference

311
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Do something happened

312
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
Speedily in this case in the heartbeat

313
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Instead of a blank

314
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
But it's not necessarily about nukes

315
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
It's about how if

316
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
Ukraine goes into NATO

317
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
And Russia attacks Chromeo which they interpret

318
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
As a defendant Premier cuz Russia

319
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Abused it as their own

320
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Then cook in a heartbeat

321
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,567
All of the NATO countries would be drawn into a war with Russia

322
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,663
Because of the rules of Article 5 which state that if one country is attacked

323
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
In the group everyone comes to their tooth

324
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
That's right

325
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:53,343
There are slight differences but these are the Fingerprints of a lack of exploration that Alex did on the topic

326
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
But he seems to like

327
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
You want to make it look like he's taking this very seriously and did a lot of digging into it

328
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
And he's missing like

329
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
The actual Contours and context

330
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
Of what is being talkative

331
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
That right

332
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Kind of irresponsible special

333
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
The topic is

334
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Impending nuclear war

335
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah

336
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
So Alex is coverings

337
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Like he is done

338
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Intensity

339
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
And

340
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,271
That he's he's really gotten to the bottom of this thing in a way that no one else has

341
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
And he feels like no one else no other media Outlet

342
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Covering it the way that Infowars is

343
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,047
Russia makes a fool of macron Biden

344
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
That's not what the headline really should stay

345
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Infowars

346
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Quotient

347
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
Vladimir Putin warns a nuclear war

348
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Breakout

349
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
If Ukraine joins NATO

350
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,135
Headline that Alex has of like humiliating macron The Daily Mail headline

351
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Of 1

352
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Their articles

353
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
The other article is

354
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Putin threatens

355
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Nuclear war

356
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,143
So they have two articles one of which is essentially the same headline as the one that he is arguing

357
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Right

358
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Synchrony just didn't look

359
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Look for anything or he's lying about what Outlets used as their headlights

360
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
Metro

361
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,711
Muse's dire threat of nuclear war in Europe is he doesn't get his way

362
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
The Daily Beast

363
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Nuclear war over Ukraine

364
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Vaden

365
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Saying for Stuff

366
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:36,255
Newsweek at quote Ukraine crisis could lead to nuclear war under new strategy

367
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Before this the financial times

368
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
Us believes Russia plants nuclear exercise to Warren West over Ukraine

369
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Untraditional used by Putin

370
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
Alex isn't discussing any exclusive

371
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,199
Snooze plenty of other outlets are running with the same lead as him and more importantly

372
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Single unit of effort into this reporting

373
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,831
Says it's just him riffing on a Daily Mail article

374
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,183
While pretending to the speech and translated it

375
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
This is just a performance of trying

376
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Mets Braves

377
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
It is phrase

378
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Nobody really thinks you did that

379
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
About research man

380
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
It's funny to imagine that

381
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
This is

382
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Altru is the result of all of his digging

383
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
What book did it's like let's play a fun game

384
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
This Daily Mail article that's like I don't know I can't take this I can't seriously

385
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:35,135
Searching can't find anything else on the internet so all of his people finally find it in Russian

386
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
And they translate it and they dig even deeper

387
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
Find a find a video that has subtitles happens to be the same video that's in the Daily Mail article

388
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
I'm going to go even further down the stupid Rabbit Hole I'm going to say they went to The Daily Beast article and then

389
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
I would like there's no way this can be true

390
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,943
So they went to Daily Beast. Are you we met

391
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
And got it in Russian

392
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Had diarrhea Translate

393
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,855
Back into English sheet that's that

394
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
That thing that makes any kind of Rush

395
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
And translation seem believable because Dario

396
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,143
Ability still doesn't

397
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Make any of this make sense

398
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,519
Do any of this work now but anytime we talk about anything address

399
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,615
He's going to have to be like we had somebody who I had a crack team translate again

400
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,759
So we get to this Daily Mail

401
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
The subtitle

402
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,879
I over it and there's some very slight differences

403
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Between this

404
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,255
Had me Kremlin transcript that I want to discuss cuz I think it does actually change some of the meaning

405
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Video app

406
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Licorice root

407
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Match one

408
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
You to finally hear me

409
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Deliberate

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
To your audience

411
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
TV online

412
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,855
Email video matches the Kremlin transcript pretty closely where there's is quote

413
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,975
I want to reiterate I've said this before and I would really like you to hear me this time and convey this mess

414
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Switch to your readers viewers

415
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
And internet users

416
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Contacts

417
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
It's missing however because this is just where the Daily Mail video begins Alex has no idea of what happened right

418
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Play before this

419
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
The question that Putin is answering a squad

420
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,639
Is mr. macron your only dialogue partner in Europe

421
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
You said you was a good conversationalist

422
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Do you consider him as an

423
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
Intermediary to convey your message

424
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Which two European

425
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Try very good question

426
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,159
So this is something that will matter later as it relates

427
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
To the larger point of Putin

428
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
He saying

429
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Would you get you here in a moment.

430
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
That gives

431
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Got some

432
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,911
Idea of why do you say

433
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
Has a response to that question

434
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
So here here's where we get a little bit more

435
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Right immediately after this is all straight through

436
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,807
Convenience later this week she totally silly Dilly.

437
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Play my Julius to do you understand

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
It or not

439
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
Ukraine's going tonight

440
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Military memes

441
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
The European countries will be automatically

442
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,336
So this is really the point of Putin's answer

443
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,944
If Ukraine joins NATO Russia is not going to respect you

444
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Ukraine's claim to Chromeo which will lead to

445
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Conflict

446
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
And because Ukraine will be then a member of NATO all the other native

447
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Countries will have to defend them

448
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
Which puts them immediately in pecans

449
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Conflict with Russia

450
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
This is important to understand that

451
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
The context of the question because

452
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
It has to do with the message that he's helping

453
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
To send to these leaders of European

454
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
In countries that would be affected by this and suck

455
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
Into that war

456
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,128
It's essentially an attempt to Blackmail the European countries do not support Ukraine joining NATO because if they do

457
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
The questioner Cormier will become their problem

458
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
Signaling in advance that he's not going to budge on it

459
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
That's

460
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
Did Messi leave listen I'm not saying that anybody is going to do any harm for you if you join NATO I'm just saying

461
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
And the other things that are already in place could be a problem for you I'm just saying don't join

462
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,704
And all I'm saying is we'll see what f****** happened

463
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,288
It's less even a message to Ukraine to not join NATO it's like

464
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
I don't support their during this is going to be on you

465
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,552
Plus now you're in a fight with

466
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,648
Or you want that France for NATO and Germany

467
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,280
Well we are going to let Russia take from

468
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,144
Then there's no point in maitopia will spoiler alert there have been a number of times in the face

469
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
Everybody come to the aid of the party is not necessarily happen

470
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
So the the clip goes on

471
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Unity skis

472
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,432
To my stitches keyboard

473
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Can you sniff

474
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Of course in Russia

475
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
Potentials are incomparable

476
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Abby Newman

477
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,096
Understand

478
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Companion

479
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Perform

480
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Is a subtle hint

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
But it's not really a direct

482
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
This is expressing that he's well aware that NATO's

483
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Combined military strength

484
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Outweighs his butt

485
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,112
He has a nuclear deterrent so pure military strength isn't the only determining Factor

486
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,208
This doesn't read to me to be a strong threat to use a nuke

487
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Because you have to remember the

488
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Context

489
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,584
This is about chromia and the Dominos that will fall

490
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
If Ukraine joins NATO and Russia does

491
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Don't give up their claims

492
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
To the area

493
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
This will lead to war but

494
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,544
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to lead to a nuclear war because

495
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,664
That would kind of be counterproductive towards settling what's essentially a regional territorial.

496
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Spirit

497
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
I'm not saying that I couldn't

498
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Spiral out of

499
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Control

500
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
You're what would they do

501
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,112
Nuke Premiere that's not in their interest no no

502
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
Look Crimea is

503
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Part of the Russian Federation

504
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
And that's why we

505
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
We have to Nuke all of Europe

506
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Does that not make sense to everybody

507
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
It makes perfect sense

508
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
It's

509
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,472
I understand how did the fear

510
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
The anxieties around

511
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
Regional conflict

512
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Getting out of control too

513
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:52,224
To the point where they absorb absorb the entire world

514
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Anxiety

515
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
I understand

516
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
It was a problem last time

517
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
The same rhetoric was flying around in the advance of the 2008 war with Georgia and the 2014

518
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Hostilities and Cormier

519
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
And even though there was active

520
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
Happening

521
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
Nukes used because

522
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
That Weaponry didn't match

523
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
The goal of that

524
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
These

525
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
These coming to these making kind of read the same way

526
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
It's too much that released to me they do is it

527
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
He's going to Nuke anyone over the conflict

528
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
But that the rest of the world shouldn't get involved

529
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
Because you wouldn't want to be at war with a nuclear power

530
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
No matter what

531
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,768
North Korea

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Fight and then we'll get this s*** out of the way

533
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Nobody's doing

534
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
This is kind of how this nuclear comment

535
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,520
Reads to me but an entirely different way

536
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
I think a fair amount of it too is just

537
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Getting out of

538
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Hand man

539
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Alex has taken listen directions that it does

540
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Does not need to go

541
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Winners

542
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
So just

543
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
Hypersonic

544
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Chris vessels and

545
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Ballistic missiles

546
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Both

547
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Horse the United States has he would stop

548
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Secret

549
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
The point is is that

550
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
It doesn't matter which nuclear weapon

551
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
Russian suicide Soldiers with suitcase

552
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
Party in Yoruba

553
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Does it matter

554
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Space space system shoot

555
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Levothyroxine

556
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Ballistic missiles or submarine launched

557
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Doesn't matter

558
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
The nukes are all over the place

559
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
The point where Alex

560
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,000
Start freestyling his own doomsday narratives

561
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,864
I barely somewhere in this transcript that he's translated there's information to Putin is embedded

562
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Suicide agents with suit at 2

563
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Suitcase nukes

564
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
All over Europe

565
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
That's definitely not a James Bond plot

566
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Right

567
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
I don't know about you but leaving aside the important point that I don't believe any of that

568
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
How can Alex

569
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
Possibly ever think that someone would have

570
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Sleeper

571
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,296
Suicide suitcase nuke agents all over foreign countries

572
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Scooby anything less than a f******

573
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,440
Supervillain honestly think that Putin is some kind of force

574
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,816
A good bringing back the west but he's also creating elaborate high-tech situations like this

575
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,960
It would essentially allow him to hold the entire world hostage again like you said like a f****** Bond villain

576
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Possibly think

577
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Stop

578
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
So tell me

579
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
None of these cuts

580
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Trees have any idea

581
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
That

582
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,368
Putin of all people is just having people carrying around suitcase nukes wherever they go

583
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
Or all the countries are like well there's nothing we can really do

584
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
If you want to carry a suitcase nuke

585
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
In f******

586
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Nebraska

587
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Go to town man

588
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
How can you tell the difference between a suitcase in a suitcase

589
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
Change the risk possible possible to tell

590
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
Havasu

591
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Suitcase ching

592
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
It's an achievable goal

593
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Very easy to do you can do it

594
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Just need a

595
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Suitcase in handcuffs

596
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Oh

597
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
So look

598
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
This is silly

599
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
I don't I don't really think

600
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
That this it I think this is a

601
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
Real real serious escalation in

602
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:24,192
Consensus sensationalization of the topic that Alex is covering and I think it's a little bit

603
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,520
Disrespectful to the actual series

604
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Of the situation.

605
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
What's going on in Ukraine

606
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,456
And it goes on Putin clip

607
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,088
And you will be pulled into this conflict against your will

608
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Who's pitching

609
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
We won't even have time to Blink

610
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
Your eye when you execute article

611
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,264
So here's where there's a slight difference in the translation I think in this context

612
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
The Daily Mail

613
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Seems less Act

614
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Info on Alex's reading

615
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,016
Certain The Daily Mail want you won't even have time to Blink your eye when you execute Article 5

616
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,136
Where is the transcript from the Kremlin says quote you will be fulfilling Article 5 in a heart

617
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Be even before you know it

618
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
Brothers around a context that makes more sense the boot movie saying that if Ukraine joins NATO these European countries would have

619
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Invoke Article 5

620
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
And come to Ukraine's Aid involving chromia in a heart

621
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
That conflict

622
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,824
Existing it isn't going away so if Ukraine is involved in the collective Alliance of mutual protection

623
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,408
The secondly join all of these governments will have to enact article

624
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
Conversely The Daily Mail translation makes it sounds like

625
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
Something else that will happen

626
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,136
After Article 5 is invoke Article 5

627
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Nukes are on their way to your house

628
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Then kind of what the Daily Mail

629
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
When you execute Article 5

630
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
Heavily implies that

631
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
Was that day after tomorrow thing

632
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
A second

633
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
Suitcase nukes you guys you guys sign the papers everybody's taking the picture and nukes are on their way to your

634
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Quite match

635
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
How the train

636
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Scraped itself reads

637
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,720
Larger picture

638
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Itself kind of more is

639
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Realpolitik

640
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Idea of like this in this is

641
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
How it is

642
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Are we the aggressors

643
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
No one can say really what is aggression

644
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,944
I just saying that Alex is not dealing with this Acura

645
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Yeah that be weird if

646
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
All the sudden we're Putin apology

647
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
I will be strain

648
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,928
Here's another clip as it goes along

649
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
President macron course

650
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Doesn't want that

651
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
And I don't want

652
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Brimstone

653
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
And I don't want it

654
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Which is why

655
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
He is here

656
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Was Maine

657
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
4/6 straight hours

658
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Alchemist read the subtitles are

659
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
He didn't say that macron have been touring with him Putin said the macron

660
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,720
I had caught been tormenting me for 6 hours now with a

661
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
His questions guarantees and solution

662
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
Email translation

663
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Ring instead of Torment

664
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
This is where Alex is understanding

665
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Comet's begins and ends

666
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,312
It's because all he has to go on his that Daily Mail video and that's where the video cuts off

667
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
Immediately after this clip in Boonton

668
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Set of macrons

669
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
The Diplomatic visit

670
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,248
Quotes I believe his is a lofty mission

671
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,416
For our part we will do our best to find compromises that suit everyone

672
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,024
There's not a single point that we consider unachievable in the proposals we sent to Nato and wash

673
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Seems like somebody who has

674
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
You know that least

675
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
Rhetorically

676
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
Uninterested

677
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,824
Keeping negotiations open

678
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
Yeah yeah yeah that mean altimate Lee listen

679
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
Here's how we want to get you

680
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,272
Because it costs a lot of money to actually fight a war

681
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
Maybe I threatened you with nukes you guys will be just like

682
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
You can have you

683
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
You know it's really expensive

684
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,792
Getting nuked I mean imagine you're in Moscow

685
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:39,680
Right and you're just going along your day and then you're getting nukes that's like at least 50 to $60 to rebuild

686
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Definitely

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Baby drop

688
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
The contact

689
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
Threatening nuclear war

690
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
That's what Alex is doing

691
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Do you read the full transcript that doesn't

692
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Bill Acura

693
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
That feels

694
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Like a bit of

695
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
Maybe some clickbait nonsense

696
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
Alex just trying to make everyone afraid

697
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
Which is a smart idea if you're helping Putin

698
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:07,584
Do you want to drive traffic I think people like in a state of

699
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Impotent

700
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Fearly Alex

701
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Have you ever

702
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Well I mean if you practice

703
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Does ducking and covering lately

704
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,568
You have a desktop

705
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
Is there bars on my side so I don't have any ducting

706
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,528
Car flip over the air

707
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
Nobody got to go to Freestyle sometimes

708
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
Tell Alex he's doing his little breakdown of the Daily Mail video that he intend to get some product of

709
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
Deep freezer

710
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Andy comes back from break

711
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Why don't you think this misreporting

712
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:46,752
Vladimir Putin officially threatened to use nuclear weapons against Europe Ukraine

713
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
An official press

714
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Warren the last V Article 5

715
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,272
Within a blink of an eye shed the West will see

716
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
A massive military response

717
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Russia

718
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
Which invention

719
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
Nuclear weapons

720
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
And that you will strike

721
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Western Europe

722
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,888
Breakdown the timetable on this if this starts

723
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Listen to

724
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
This isn't accurate based on the actual press conference

725
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,592
Even accurate to the Daily Mail video that Alex is using as a source

726
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
And there's two really critical things

727
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Things that

728
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
I need to talk about

729
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
The first is that Alec doesn't

730
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
You seem to even understand

731
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
Conceptually what he's talkin about

732
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:38,208
The way he's talking about Article 5 shows that he thinks something to absorb into the group

733
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
But that is not correct at all

734
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Articles

735
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
State score

736
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,704
The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack

737
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Attack against them all

738
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,312
And consequently they agree that if such an attack occurs

739
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Each of them

740
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,968
An exercise of the right of individual or Collective self-defense recognized by article 51

741
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
Of the charter of the United Nations

742
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,064
Will assist the party or parties so attack

743
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
By taking

744
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Forthwith

745
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,416
Individually and in concert with other parties

746
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
Such action as a deems necessary

747
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Including the use of Armed Force

748
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
To restore and maintain the security

749
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Of the North Atlantic area

750
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,216
It's the rule that natak on one member state is an attack on all member

751
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,568
Perseids not a mechanism by which an 80 can absorb countries into itself like it

752
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
The Blob

753
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
This was a part of NATO

754
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Core cause

755
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,224
And it's been in place since 1949 but it's only

756
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
It was never in Polkton

757
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Until 9:11

758
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,088
To tell you this is not a universal thing that happen

759
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
All the time

760
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
Not a ton of people are stoked about getting into Wars

761
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Not usually

762
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
The fact that Alex doesn't seem to

763
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
Grasp this conceptually like what article 5 is

764
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,888
Really makes it difficult to trust that he has any understanding

765
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
The conversation the boutin was

766
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
He's covering

767
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
And that leads me to my second point

768
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
This is a serious story one that involves

769
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
The Safety and Security of a ton of people in Ukraine and Russia

770
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
In particular

771
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
But it could have ramifications

772
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
People outside the region

773
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
As well

774
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,808
According to Alex himself this is a story that I

775
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,160
Potential consequences in the neighborhood of a worldwide thermonuclear war

776
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,488
He can't be bothered to know the basics of what he's talking

777
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
This is something that's at the center of a lot of Alex's

778
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Contact

779
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
Intense and terrifying sensationalization

780
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
And decided not to look at

781
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
Is embarrassing and it serves to give the audience

782
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
It's not an absent event

783
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Information but actually

784
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
Bad information that they

785
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
I think is good

786
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
They think their information

787
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
That everyone's about to

788
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Is more accurate

789
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Then the information

790
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Maybe everyone's about to die

791
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
It's like he's not

792
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:52,096
Not not having food is having food that will make you sick

793
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
It's just

794
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
When it's around this kind of

795
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Subject that is

796
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Conceivably very serious

797
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Like I am not

798
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,688
Convinced that this is going to lead to nuclear war but Alex seems to be

799
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
That's the way he presented the story and he

800
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Even

801
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Get himself

802
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
MultiCare passed

803
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
His normal routine of finding a headline

804
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
Lying about what he's done

805
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,744
Prepare the store and then ripping about his own

806
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,328
Paranoid and terrifying fantasy

807
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah and I I mean

808
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
You know the more you think about it

809
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Galaxy

810
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
With love

811
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,288
Thermonuclear war that would be a great button on his career

812
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Well you still working on that bunker

813
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,248
I need to get out that would get him out of a lot of s*** if all of a sudden nukes were dropping everywhere

814
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,856
He be like I mean obviously my Skin's going to melt off but

815
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
I'm out of these lawsuits

816
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
It would probably put a delay on on those

817
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Yeah little bit

818
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Alex

819
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,120
Alex takes this misreporting these doing of this

820
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
This, and he just turns it into like just

821
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
Bucking terrifying story

822
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,544
Breakdown the timetable on this

823
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
If this starts

824
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
When the Russians get overwhelmed by the NATO forces arrayed

825
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Heavy weapon

826
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
The forces

827
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
10 minutes

828
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
The orders will go out

829
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
Cruise missiles

830
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
Sonic Russian military

831
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
What's the Russians make the decision to use

832
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Cruise missiles ready their icbm's ready

833
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
And the minute

834
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
Weather radar satellite

835
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Missile launchers they will have a total commitment release

836
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
Other weapons or submarines

837
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
All of

838
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,912
Directions cities will be

839
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Verizon's well

840
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
Western Europe will be vaporized

841
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,872
Here's onto like really lay out this like I won't even have time to go find my daughter like

842
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,480
Really highly dramatic okay really

843
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Aiming to scare

844
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
You know okay

845
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,160
Suitcase nukes you can conceivably say that it's

846
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,744
Easier to get a single person with a nuclear bomb

847
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,536
Device in a suitcase around

848
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Then

849
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,424
Having a f****** nuclear submarine off the coast of New York City

850
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,496
You know what I honestly don't know

851
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,152
What Harbor

852
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
Near New York City

853
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
But they allowed rushing to get what what world are there people walking around with

854
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,464
Suitcase a little bit more noticeable

855
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Probably probably

856
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,608
13B like elaborate masking technology that the aliens

857
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,192
If you know what I had not considered the aliens

858
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,056
I agree it's a little far-fetched but I

859
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Not sure it's more farfetch

860
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,176
Text Ed suitcase with suicide bombers

861
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
I don't know which that'll be tough contest

862
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Cast

863
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
But like Alex

864
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Houses just like

865
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Really trying to drive home the sphere

866
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Maybe the cikaracak f***

867
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Most of us will just get

868
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
Knock-down

869
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,584
May the roof caved in on you but when you come outside we breathing all that

870
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Delicious radiation

871
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
Give me when you get up again

872
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Won't be coming back on

873
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
4 years if you're lucky

874
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,848
That's where we are and where the evil decadence satanic Society

875
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
I mean really

876
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,504
What yeah okay

877
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
Maybe it started I didn't expect that turned you know what I was thinking I was just thinking

878
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
I think everybody

879
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
Time to die

880
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,048
Maybe we should all

881
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,352
You know what go find a spike

882
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,704
Just f****** do it man I believe in humanity

883
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
What is this

884
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
Maybe it's time for all of us to die

885
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
You know what weird mood

886
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah I don't I don't really know how to read this

887
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Other than like

888
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
I guess he's depressed

889
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
No

890
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
You'd have to be a little depressed

891
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:33,952
To be very blase about the extinction of the human race there's some financial news

892
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,768
That will be discussed later that my plan for this

893
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
Okay I might have something to do with his head

894
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
Nolet's

895
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,544
Actor from the past makes it appear in ham

896
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
All right for that

897
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Alex's discussing

898
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,759
Like maybe we all deserve to die from nukes

899
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
He starts rambling around

900
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
He drops

901
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
Drops a bomb of his own

902
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
That's

903
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
A little bit unbelievable okay

904
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
The CIA

905
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,999
Georgetown University

906
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
Literally has sick an army

907
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
5 / 10000 Muslims

908
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,751
Run through the school and given degrees

909
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Intelligence badges

910
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
What games are Muslims

911
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Okay

912
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
They've got list of judges that got list of people

913
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Captains

914
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,559
We're a lot more trouble than you know okay

915
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
So I guess it's a we're all going to die episode

916
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,471
Yeah it's not a

917
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
So this mood his is flipped

918
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
That's pretty clear

919
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
This is really dumb

920
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
We've done this narrative already

921
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
But it was a year-and-a-half ago but

922
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,831
Instead of a brigade of Muslims

923
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
While the Patriots and we're going to go door-to-door taking them out

924
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,999
And now I guess enough time has passed that Alex to be sure that his audience

925
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
Forgotten that he said that s***

926
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:21,471
We don't need to worry about the migrant Caravan anymore

927
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,335
Becoming brigades or even when Alex was saying that was a way to get Ebola

928
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Yes yeah it's all there

929
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
You know that old adage

930
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,503
The best way to keep a secret it between more than

931
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
2 people is

932
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Just to kill the other two or whatever

933
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
You know what I'm saying

934
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
I'm going to go with

935
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
Having entire Brigade

936
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
Forced to keep their own participation

937
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
In secret

938
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
I might be

939
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
That might be tough to do man who is to give them badges to easily identify

940
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Bouquet

941
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,359
Why would you leave 10,000 of them to take out Alex

942
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
I mean if you got a secret army

943
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
Part of the reason that you have it apart of

944
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
The best

945
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
Having a secret armies

946
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
You know

947
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Cuz it's Secret

948
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
Right

949
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,695
I like specialized unit to maybe usually

950
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,023
People who

951
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,095
Solve the problem and then are gone

952
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:26,495
I need a tech guy absolutely Nations person

953
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,871
10000 mobile drive to get Alex

954
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,199
That's very weird I love it with a religion

955
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,039
Together Alex sub another subject

956
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Text Gabby

957
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
The Capitol Police share

958
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
They're out of control

959
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
Social media

960
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
Meet with lawmakers

961
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,911
You read the article it says yeah they also didn't respond

962
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,495
But now the documents are coming out being released by Congress

963
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Any

964
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Investigation of the

965
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
Spectre General

966
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Michelle

967
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Are the Capitol Police

968
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
Unbelievable

969
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
Members of Congress has

970
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Offices at night

971
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
The plumbers

972
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Nixon dead

973
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Having

974
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,839
Gordon Liddy and others break into the psychiatrist

975
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
To find out about him

976
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,079
Pictures of Capitol Police breaking in people's officers

977
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,895
Closing is capital repair

978
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
Photographing and stealing material

979
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:50,207
There's a tough narrative route to be dipping into because it might clip there within one minute he's essentially gotten into trouble with two

980
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
With his friends

981
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,119
Rodger work for Nixon and Watergate didn't go down like that

982
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
Now based on Alex's reporting

983
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
Then Alex's describing what these folks in the Capitol Police allegedly did going into offices dressed up like maintenance people

984
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,895
And that's exactly what James O'Keefe got arrested

985
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
Super doing to Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu

986
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
Play Wild how many friends Alex has

987
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Who do the precise evil shanty

988
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
He's so mad at his enemies for

989
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Supposedly doing

990
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,975
The only way to your enemies are doing evil ship

991
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Is to be the p

992
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
People who do that either

993
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Sure

994
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:32,191
That makes sense to me article it's a disturbing Revelation that the Capitol Police

995
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
Been doing some digging into the social media and other public

996
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Information

997
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,103
That's available for people who meet with members of Congress

998
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
And I'm not into it

999
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
But Alex is lying about what this article covers

1000
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,807
There's nothing in the article that's buying in plain clothes that's just Alex adding to the recipe for

1001
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
Buy more flavor

1002
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,951
Also it's Alex referring to allegations made by representative Troy meals

1003
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,535
Who claimed that the police were caught snooping in his office

1004
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,631
Capitol Police released a statement saying that no one was snooping

1005
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,447
But someone did a his office to secure it

1006
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,775
Because he left his office door open when nobody was in it

1007
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
When that happened

1008
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,591
It's protocol for the Capitol Police

1009
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
Security office

1010
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
And close the door for him

1011
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
It's not safe

1012
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:19,039
The Capitol Police has come out with a statement this dude's a big dumb dumb

1013
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,647
Close your f****** door. Maybe we won't have to show up

1014
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Also Alex can't possibly read the inspector General's

1015
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Report that he's claimed

1016
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
Going to have on the Capitol Police looking

1017
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,559
Get folks social media

1018
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:35,167
Investigation cuz that just began this week and there's no info that's come out about it yet

1019
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,055
He may be confusing with this with the IG report about the Capitol Police regarding January

1020
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
Text but I'm also sure he

1021
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Read that right

1022
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
I don't know

1023
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
It just

1024
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
This is

1025
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Ridiculous

1026
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
I think I've only interested in nightclub

1027
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,647
Because it's funny that this guy just didn't close his door turned into a conspiracy theory

1028
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
And then the second thing is

1029
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
So how much Alex's friends

1030
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Are implicated in the same Act

1031
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,607
Evil

1032
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,679
But it is it is somewhat of that that like

1033
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
I know they must be doing it because we are

1034
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,079
It is kind of that Vibe of like

1035
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Well obviously I know what the

1036
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
The evil people are doing

1037
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
My buddies are doing the same thing

1038
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
That would be fine

1039
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
If there wasn't

1040
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Also the denial of what his buddies are doing doing the evil s*** that they I say the other guys are doing

1041
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,815
My buddies are doing the single shape

1042
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
Haha now that I'm telling you that I

1043
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
Think they didn't do it you won't get mad at me

1044
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
It's it's convoluted

1045
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
Alex gets back into the Caravan

1046
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
A little bit

1047
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
The trucker is up in Ottawa

1048
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Popular novel

1049
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
A good time

1050
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
Population of aw not having a great time

1051
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
It's like the Brooks Brothers Riot with

1052
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Trucks

1053
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,463
Awful and longer and longer

1054
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,047
So my heart goes out to the folks that I have to put up with this

1055
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,375
Alex has a guy on to talk about how great

1056
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,703
The the Caravan is and how how how awesome

1057
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
They're getting free to everybody

1058
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Jeremy Mackenzie

1059
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
And he

1060
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,247
Is joining us

1061
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
Here on air

1062
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
Popular podcasts

1063
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
He's joining us to talk about

1064
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,951
The latest incredible developments in

1065
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,535
I don't really want to get more in-depth

1066
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
We already have

1067
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,423
The trucker Caravan if my position has changed

1068
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
On it since the last time we talked about

1069
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:50,591
But it's interesting to Alex's got busy to talk about the news from the front lines

1070
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,175
Alex called in this guy named Jeremy Mackenzie

1071
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Wouldn't you know it

1072
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
He's not the trucker he's

1073
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
Actually a piece of s***

1074
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:03,391
I'm not totally sure that McKenzie has a podcast but he definitely is a livestream that I was able to find

1075
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
Interesting comments that he made on stream

1076
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,511
Thanks to their being collected by anti-racist Canada

1077
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,559
Here's one of them that is

1078
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Not good

1079
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,935
Like that you watch that movie like Schindler's List actually is based on

1080
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Fictional book

1081
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Oh my God

1082
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Wright's really

1083
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
Oskar Schindler was a

1084
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Black the movie

1085
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Was based on a

1086
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Digital Book

1087
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
But they presented as though

1088
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,783
This is what happened 10 Dark 30

1089
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Make it very

1090
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Jessica Berry

1091
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,159
So you're learning about a

1092
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Something new for the first time

1093
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Now you're seeing this visual fuc

1094
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Sprayed in there

1095
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
This becomes memory like this

1096
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
What happened

1097
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
It's like you're watching

1098
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
You're watching a

1099
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
Production either actors in costumes and if none of this is real

1100
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
Now you believe that that would That's History when that's not what

1101
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Place

1102
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,663
It's f****** crazy like yours that you're the great example there's a movie there's a guy

1103
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,991
I need to call in a revisionist nnn all all of the

1104
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Things you can do

1105
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
The guy's a historian it is David Irving

1106
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
From the UK

1107
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,927
Oh boy I just want to know

1108
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,511
So he went over to Germany and winter any interviewed all kinds of people didn't

1109
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Like a c

1110
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
Elektra

1111
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Any road

1112
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Schwarzenegger

1113
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Yep stuff from people you never ever hear about otherwise

1114
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Jerry

1115
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,991
Is based on the non-fiction novel Schindler's Ark

1116
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:37,087
The events of the story are true it's just that some of the dialogues been dramatized

1117
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,927
Really weird the way this guy's calling it a story of fiction

1118
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,743
It also seems to have trouble understanding the people know

1119
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
That there are actors in movies

1120
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Scariest movies ever

1121
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:53,471
I mean it is so much like a you can hear it when they talk or you're like oh

1122
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Of course

1123
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,591
You think other people think movies are real you think

1124
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,223
Think movies are real sir

1125
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Not what David Irving did

1126
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
No that's

1127
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
This guy is very wrong

1128
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
David Irving is a

1129
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
A full-on holocaust

1130
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
Austin IR

1131
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Famous in the world

1132
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,327
He tried to sue journalistew called him a holocaust denier for defamation Auntie loss

1133
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:25,727
He very publicly argued that there were no gas Chambers at all schwitz which landed him in jail in Austria

1134
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:30,335
He's been banned from entering multiple countries because of his anti-Semitism in Holocaust denial

1135
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,639
He's associated with the Neo-Nazi group

1136
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
The National Alliance

1137
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,479
Enemy here since like 1990

1138
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
His entire public Persona has been

1139
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Open pro-hitler anti Jews

1140
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
And denying of the Holocaust

1141
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,207
You look is Mackenzie guys who are neo-nazis jorian

1142
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,767
Neo-Nazi

1143
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
Generous as possible he's

1144
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
Idiot who seems to be drawn like a boss

1145
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,167
The flame towards any.

1146
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,239
Information that makes these look good

1147
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
To act

1148
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Honestly

1149
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
He is not an illness

1150
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
He's just a regular Nazi

1151
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
That's just

1152
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
Out of time

1153
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,039
It's like he time traveled from 1939

1154
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
There's any way there's an issue of semantics

1155
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
6 against to get into but

1156
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Flabbergasted

1157
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:23,583
Delete plenty more interviews of him pal around with white nationalist folks like the host of Red Ice

1158
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Stevie

1159
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:30,751
I was doing interviews about how the protocols of the Elders of Zion are actually real with the anti-semetic ahdoot

1160
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Could have chose

1161
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:42,527
To come speak out about the trucker's in Autobot given update

1162
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
The guy you find we got to find the most Nazi

1163
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
C10 most likely travel and similar ideological circles as they do if you know a lot of

1164
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:56,351
Nazis and you been a lot of Nazis know you and they like you and you like them

1165
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,887
I'm going to throw this out there

1166
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
Maybe you are also an

1167
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,751
Hey there could be a part of the interview where he's like

1168
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:08,895
They said there were Nazi flag there was one guy with a knife

1169
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
It is

1170
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
Listen to too much about

1171
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
Interview

1172
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,039
Really

1173
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,879
Care and I don't think he brings a lot to the table or any interesting information

1174
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
Really funny thing that keeps happen

1175
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Have italics

1176
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:26,303
Keeps saying this guy's Special Forces

1177
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
And he has to keep correct

1178
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,887
And because he doesn't want to engage in Stolen Valor

1179
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
Right right cuz he wasn't

1180
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,031
Very short. Of time where he was in a special forces

1181
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Does unit or something along those lines

1182
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
But Alex will not stop getting it wrong

1183
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,711
Has it he's had to correct him and I believe this is the second

1184
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
Gametime Alex

1185
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
F****** loser

1186
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Mike's after this

1187
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:54,463
Yeah I saw that that was one of the aspects of the I can brief you when it was a Special Forces Unit

1188
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
You're in my bed be right now

1189
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
You got

1190
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
God help me

1191
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,711
I'm just telling people who you are

1192
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,599
Can you tell me don't say I'm this and then you say don't say that

1193
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Let's just say you're in

1194
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
Each other

1195
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,847
Man-in-the-middle

1196
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
But like

1197
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,783
No no.

1198
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
This is

1199
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
Deadly serious if you know what is it what is it with you guys and you don't like me lying about what it is you did in the military

1200
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:04,607
I think it's probably because a lot of people that Alex knows get accused of lying about their military history because they are

1201
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:09,471
I think that's probably why he's hypersensitive about this point

1202
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
Like him for any other reason but this

1203
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
Mackenzie guy seems like

1204
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Like that

1205
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,455
That's the right thing to do

1206
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,503
Senior military service

1207
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,319
You probably don't want to be seen

1208
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Playing along with that less

1209
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,439
Everybody else think that you're also inflating

1210
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Flying rice

1211
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,583
Your service absolutely which is why Alex hates military guys because the real ones actually do that

1212
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
He likes non-military guys who claim they're in the military because when you say they're in special forces that like

1213
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,823
Like f*** yeah I was exactly

1214
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:51,455
I was all over the Special Forces they come on man improvised with me don't

1215
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:55,295
Don't downplay this I need to present you as the greatest

1216
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
Best possible source of information

1217
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:02,207
Therefore you started the Special Forces took down an entire Brigade of muscle

1218
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
10000

1219
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
They were in Austin

1220
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
I was busy

1221
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
See you at that's

1222
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
That was just a little bit of fun

1223
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
After this

1224
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
Alex

1225
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
As a familiar face

1226
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,335
Come around, around

1227
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
It's not author

1228
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
Then the the former gold salesman

1229
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,039
Henderson spend some time on

1230
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,831
Who he is what he's doing

1231
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
He was a sponsor of mine

1232
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,159
In 1997

1233
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,231
A year later he started the gcn radio network

1234
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,535
Pictures already sent he was already

1235
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Financing a bunch of shows he already had a production

1236
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,167
Popular on AM FM shortwave

1237
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,079
He already set up as Network

1238
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,871
Two years before was getting it ready

1239
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,175
I was already doing another show on everyday

1240
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
9 years ago 10 years ago in a gold bar

1241
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Anymore

1242
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
Parted ways with Chad but said you can still carry my show

1243
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Educated

1244
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
Crustaceans

1245
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
And

1246
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
Any more side to go out

1247
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,055
Michelle Morin and try to get money in

1248
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:25,151
Stop being able to pay Alex because a gold market took a dip

1249
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
Lily's nuts there's no indication

1250
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:32,319
It seems like it was because he got sued for the fraud and customers Minnesota took away his license

1251
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
Sell precious metals

1252
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
Also we've been over this at length but

1253
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
Their relationship

1254
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
Some good buddy is just trying to help each other out

1255
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Alex Azar

1256
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,095
Shameless gold salesman for large stretches of his career

1257
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
Mysteriously

1258
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
Begin blast gung-ho about

1259
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,447
I want desperately needed to buy gold

1260
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
More recent career

1261
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,031
That's after Ted stop selling gold

1262
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
It's crazy how

1263
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:59,455
Quickly went from gold will save your life and protect you from all diseases

1264
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Zinc will save your life

1265
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:06,623
Protect you all from diseases it seems like the focus has shifted and it's like

1266
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,671
It's you know I also like whenever

1267
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
The relationship

1268
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,511
Of money changes with Alex or it's like

1269
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
Ted Anderson when he's giving money

1270
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Is the greatest

1271
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Person

1272
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
That ever lived

1273
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,679
Incredible when he's not getting money

1274
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,519
This guy I remember him he couldn't pay me anymore

1275
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:29,919
That's how broke this guy was this guy couldn't pay me me but I'm such a good guy

1276
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:35,295
Exactly he's going with them

1277
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
So guess what

1278
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
He got wrapped up in

1279
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
The Sandy Hook

1280
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,231
It's not working out well for him

1281
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
Pikachu

1282
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
4 years ago

1283
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
The Shandy

1284
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
And

1285
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,471
Nothing to what I said on-air did and I was already off

1286
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
He was only a satellite provider

1287
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
I don't care about that

1288
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,151
And now we know now.

1289
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
Plus

1290
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
I just want to get this out now

1291
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
What's 700 + affiliates

1292
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
100 shows on it

1293
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
But we talk radio in

1294
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,167
For couple years it's been losing money but because it's a

1295
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
Project he started

1296
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
He's losing hundreds of thousands a year and that number is going up

1297
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
And so they say that's fine

1298
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,991
Just give us your whole network

1299
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Eucerin

1300
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,135
Syncing directory off the air which it would be a crippling blow

1301
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:48,511
Surrender surrender

1302
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
In the Connecticut Sandy Hook case

1303
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,887
And that simply because he was disseminating and profiting off of Alex

1304
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
Defamatory content

1305
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
Did targeted harassment

1306
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
I'm not positive that Alex's Shady business

1307
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,055
Miss practices are going to salvage this case

1308
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
It's because I feel like

1309
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,663
You know if they have an existing syndication agreement

1310
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
I meant I can't afford to pay Alex and Alex's why don't you just

1311
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
Keep on doing it not pay me

1312
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
That seems likely agreement is

1313
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Phelan Place Alex has just agreed to forgo payment

1314
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:22,559
I'll just leave that just means the Ted's making even more money off Alex's lies about Sandy Hook families

1315
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Need to cut Alex in for a taste

1316
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:28,447
He's essentially gotten rid of his overhead for lies

1317
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:34,847
Stocks to beat a drug test

1318
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,895
It's it's

1319
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
It's interesting I mean like

1320
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
I guess maybe

1321
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,783
Do you know his his radio network is a

1322
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,319
I asked that they could be

1323
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Beamed

1324
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:51,999
Possible something you need to sell for whatever damage

1325
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,791
Bankruptcy they're going to take them ass up

1326
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
Yeah and I thought it was really strange

1327
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,631
Because Alex is like he's going to fight

1328
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,911
This case but like

1329
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:05,823
Part a day even like I don't know this to be true because I I don't have a whole lot of understanding of the inner work

1330
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
Kings of the Connecticut case

1331
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
They say that he got the

1332
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
Defaulted along with them

1333
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
Like

1334
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,599
Like Alex says that he's already lost the case

1335
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,439
He just would be fighting the damages portion I guess

1336
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,999
I don't know that's not the case.

1337
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
What ink

1338
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,327
The name are they doing

1339
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Crazy

1340
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Absolute lunacy

1341
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
Alex

1342
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
He wants to build Ted up as a

1343
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
The hero right

1344
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
Why does

1345
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Money

1346
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
All the people

1347
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,343
And then they come to him

1348
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
Thomas for a while

1349
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,463
You know what screw this I'm not going to shut down

1350
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,399
But because they're trying to shut him down and because they're trying to silence those other Rose

1351
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
Sometime you had you down the road I know.

1352
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
What other places

1353
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
Better than ever

1354
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,223
He's here with us today ladies and gentlemen

1355
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Talk about that

1356
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
Appreciate

1357
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Kids already spent

1358
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
300-plus thousand dollars

1359
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,535
About to go to trial and vitamins going to cost him a half million dollars

1360
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,607
He's already losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year

1361
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
I'm getting judgments on him you know he's totally innocent

1362
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:42,847
Give the shopping but he's in America because the first amendment believes he's going to do it but he needs your help

1363
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
This is sad

1364
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,967
Do the last person who's come around begging

1365
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
On this shows

1366
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,855
You literally the guy selling them gold for the last few decades

1367
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:59,231
This is where he's got to like this makes me really distrustful of precious metals investment

1368
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,095
Deeply involved in Golden

1369
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Silver

1370
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
Iceman

1371
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,983
I mean it's hard to hear Alex say anything other than

1372
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,055
Ted Anderson is a really bad busy

1373
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
Businessman

1374
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,871
Who is also kind of a fraud

1375
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:22,015
And f***** up by allowing me to say whatever you want

1376
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
Give him

1377
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Free market capitalist

1378
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:31,743
This guy is losing hundreds of thousands of dollars of year a year running a business

1379
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
You should do

1380
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
Is give it to you to fail

1381
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
With no review duration

1382
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
Just bail them out

1383
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
He's a great businessman to promote this this website save gci.com

1384
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,711
Which is actually just a redirect to give send go campaign

1385
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Right

1386
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
But like

1387
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
The

1388
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
B wildbuddies Oz

1389
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,951
He's going to put commercials on all of his shows on the gcn network or people to go to that website and have to work

1390
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Yeah but like

1391
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,023
He was already doing

1392
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Sort of

1393
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
But he was like

1394
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Selling space

1395
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,983
Marshalls on TV commercials for buying ads

1396
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
On gcn

1397
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,799
Basically like

1398
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,127
That is give me money but then you get something out of it get mad

1399
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
This is just like

1400
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,527
Donate donate to keep my business afloat right

1401
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
If there was

1402
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,647
Potential for this business

1403
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,207
Need to do this because people would be buying that at

1404
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
And I would be getting him

1405
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:41,119
Yeah I mean I can understand these people being scammed by like

1406
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Religious

1407
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,935
People you know the the gospel

1408
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,471
The Prosperity Gospel people

1409
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
Cuz they don't have an actual business

1410
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,079
No you can always just be like all I'm giving it to God

1411
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,663
Not like I'm giving it to a failed business man who lied

1412
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,271
History of broad

1413
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:03,135
To pay my rent but goddamn this man's failing business needs me to

1414
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,159
Give it money

1415
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,231
I keep chat on the air

1416
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
Important for democracy

1417
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,583
Elephant in the room

1418
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
And that is that Alex

1419
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,911
Could just give Dad money

1420
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,239
Then dude you don't get rich by giving money away

1421
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
URL backup

1422
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,079
They're saved ccn.com

1423
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
Gcn.com one word

1424
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
Don't make a donation

1425
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
1500 2000 dollar

1426
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
Depending on

1427
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
Because you don't

1428
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Money

1429
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,487
Do you want to try to help me or what

1430
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
Turn the network

1431
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,471
He needs money

1432
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,543
So basically if you take this version

1433
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Of the story

1434
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:58,687
I need $300,000 in Alex's like

1435
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,991
Let's get the audience pay for it

1436
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
You got it

1437
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Yep

1438
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
And I wouldn't be too surprised

1439
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,951
If it wasn't a situation with the behind-the-scenes conversation was more like Ted being like

1440
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Hey Alex

1441
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,999
You f****** a******

1442
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
You got me into this trouble

1443
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Like you

1444
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
I'm on the hook for this because of

1445
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,631
Love you

1446
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:22,495
I buy syndicated you're so I made your f****** career right I know so much about you

1447
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
You're going

1448
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
To find a way to

1449
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,591
To pay my legal fees here because

1450
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
It's your fault you better

1451
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
I wouldn't be too surprised if there was something along those lines

1452
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
NSAID

1453
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,319
Man you know I don't know I would imagine that he does

1454
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,623
Didn't get to talk to Alex like that anymore

1455
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:46,559
Well I mean Alex has that you know when they're when it's 10 Anderson and Alex you can't really say oh well reveal

1456
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,119
Information about you because the answer to that is

1457
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,703
I'll reveal information about you I mean we're both

1458
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Scamming Liars

1459
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,311
He been through true Court

1460
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
What is fraud

1461
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:05,247
I'm not seriously suggesting that I really had to have been some kind of

1462
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Tractor reveal information

1463
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,343
But I would be very surprised if there was

1464
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,647
The conversation surrounded

1465
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
This is your fault Alex

1466
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,023
You're going to do something to help me to do something yet

1467
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
And if it

1468
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,631
All it is is giving me an hour to beg your audience for money

1469
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,423
Then I guess that's what I'll take

1470
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
These aren't used to give

1471
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
Ted money and Alex Wood

1472
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
He doesn't have any money

1473
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:32,639
And that means you should give him money same person gives a millionaire money

1474
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
That's why we have shave

1475
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Infowars.com

1476
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
It also takes you to give shimko

1477
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,559
Amazing it's a plug to support

1478
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,655
We can't cuz he don't have any money so you got to give him money to

1481
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,567

We got pills

1483
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,919
Who is Scott

1484
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:12,575
People can buy a lot of Revenue

1485
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Streams that involve

1486
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
No one getting anything for anything

1487
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:22,047
Weird coin of are selling

1488
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,607
Didn't work out surprised

1489
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,631
I'm shocked

1490
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Step

1491
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,447
So Alex got to break

1492
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Viking news

1493
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,775
Here

1494
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
Where is Sturgis

1495
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,407
Hey I got some

1496
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,991
10

1497
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,295
So Alex got some but some breaking news

1498
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
But it isn't

1499
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,183
I just received information in the last 10 minutes

1500
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,303
This is all coming out of wire

1501
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,607
That leaves us I'm going to bring the shop

1502
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
Weather

1503
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
Joel skousen but it's a

1504
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
And I was reading the.

1505
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Biden DHHS declares terrorism threat

1506
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,103
Due to fall some asleep

1507
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,663
Document

1508
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
Ascension speech

1509
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
Is Terrorism

1510
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
Sanctioned means authorized by the government

1511
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,975
The bulletin that the DHS put out the day before this episode

1512
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
Resume doesn't say that unsane

1513
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
Can speech is now a legal

1514
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
That it would be surprised

1515
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,191
I think Alex is just surprising for the DHHS

1516
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,519
I think Alex is just misreading the word unsubstantiated

1517
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
Like unsubstantiated narratives

1518
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
It's

1519
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
Yeah yeah

1520
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
I think it would have

1521
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:40,895
Pantry

1522
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,247
This is just a bulletin expressing the awareness that there are Terror threats

1523
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,599
That are growing out of the covid in Iowa Community the 2020 election fraud community

1524
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,207
And some other communities that are largely driven by rampant online misinformation

1525
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,559
This is not a controversial statement and soon as long as it remains a threat assessment

1526
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
And not a call for the DHHS

1527
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
The police the internet for misinformation

1528
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,679
This story is a zero

1529
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
It's kind of sad too

1530
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
See this

1531
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
And be like

1532
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Wow

1533
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,847
If this was 2009 you could turn this into a mayak.

1534
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
Totally

1535
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,967
You just don't have the chops anymore you're going to forget about this in a we know

1536
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
You just doesn't have it

1537
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Man

1538
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,391
The last people I would want policing

1539
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
Anything on the internet rdhs

1540
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
Yeah yeah

1541
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,255
But

1542
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,887
Recognize

1543
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
Spheres and communities are

1544
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Places

1545
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
Is where

1546
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,031
Their potential Terror threats are developing

1547
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
I think of that

1548
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,871
Rio within what they're meant to do

1549
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,895
True absolutely

1550
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,943
Just like okay why are you

1551
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Putting out a press release saying water is wet

1552
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,319
Alex gets back into the

1553
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Open story

1554
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
Because he's got Joel skousen

1555
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,159
Coming up

1556
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,231
Hear this you read that Daily Mail article and he was like

1557
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,887
Get me Scalzo leave that man has my expert on these matters

1558
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:11,007
But also Alex Tidwell

1559
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
Obviously

1560
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,591
We already played this several times the first shower but

1561
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,175
If Calvin once we can reread this on air

1562
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,247
My interpretation of it is

1563
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
He said

1564
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
NATO

1565
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
Claire's Article 5 in baseball

1566
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
Retakes in Ukraine

1567
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,487
800 overwhelms us were going to use nuclear weapons

1568
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,279
And I said

1569
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,327
Very very chilling

1570
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
And

1571
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,679
The video when I saw it

1572
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,775
I wouldn't actually found the video of Putin indeed saying that

1573
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:48,895
There's such an agenda that Alex has to create the appearance that he didn't do nothing

1574
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
It's it's

1575
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
Kind of

1576
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,271
Understandable because I think he is self-conscious about how

1577
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
Little he does

1578
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:01,695
Yeah yeah how much he wants to have the appearance of somebody who takes the shitz and

1579
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
Enterprise

1580
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,767
I mean I get it

1581
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
It's sad because he didn't

1582
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
City.

1583
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
No

1584
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,959
No I mean but if you're the emperor and you're not wearing any clothes

1585
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
It's really smart

1586
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
How to tell people that

1587
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
You totally are

1588
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,335
You're totally I'm wearing so many f****** clothes

1589
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,871
This morning

1590
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,175
Tried on a million different clothes

1591
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,711
And I'm wearing all of them right now

1592
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:30,111
I didn't just trust that Daily Mail are dug around I found the video that was embedded in

1593
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,719
The Daily Mail article from to Elmore Leonard gumshoes

1594
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
So 1000 comes in

1595
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Immediately

1596
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
Just punctures

1597
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,143
This entire bubble

1598
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,751
The whole narrative goes away okay

1599
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,311
Charles and thank you for joining us

1600
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,127
What in the world is really going on with this Russia situation

1601
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:00,063
There's a lot of posturing going on especially by Putin and in that particular

1602
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Understatement

1603
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:07,487
He knows that the United States is not going to invade by does already said it's off

1604
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,071
The tables are going to be no troops coming into Ukraine

1605
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:16,447
When it's attack they're going to let us know they're going to wring her hands are going to do sanctions

1606
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,039
You don't handle their future gas needs but

1607
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,087
I'm still

1608
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
This is going to lead

1609
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,231
Two nuclear war because the US will not go to war with Russia

1610
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
For Ukraine

1611
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:46,399
So 1000 comes in with whether or not any assessments are correct or anything

1612
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
Voice of authority cuz Alex's build him up as the one of the best geopolitical expert

1613
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
Just contradict Alex

1614
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,919
Across-the-board

1615
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Alex spent like

1616
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
10 minutes doing it

1617
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,807
Bizarre fantasy about how quickly nukes will kill us all

1618
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,463
I'm in Skyland company like that it's not good as his posture and did you not listen to the early part of the show

1619
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Corsicana

1620
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Thousand

1621
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
Said

1622
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,607
That we all deserve to die

1623
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,911
And now you're telling me we're not going to

1624
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:25,567
It's deflating XXX weather

1625
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
Word of God

1626
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
I think the scouts and can tell

1627
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:35,551
That maybe Alex is a little bit disappointed

1628
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Big news

1629
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Skim something

1630
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,719
Take the wrong collapse in 1990

1631
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,791
Orders due

1632
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,863
It'll let the Wall come down let the riots go forward

1633
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:52,703
They even gave orders for the Communist dictators to step down

1634
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,519
Chow chesko ever met anyone who

1635
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Refused Indians wife

1636
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:09,087
Wow sothi the fall of the Soviet Union flag

1637
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,671
When I heard that is like don't tell Steve

1638
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,255
Cuz he took down

1639
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:21,119
This is a man this is a complicated mythology that is occurring

1640
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
Out-and-out in

1641
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Violent conflict with itself right

1642
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,847
Possible that Steve pieczenik was then in on the false flag

1643
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:38,527
Felling of the Soviet Union Audi killed Aldo Moro so he probably faked

1644
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,111
I think that this is this indicates a

1645
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,415
Lack of seriousness

1646
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,207
Well I mean

1647
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Full marks

1648
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
You're saying we're not going to go

1649
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
To Total nuclear war

1650
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:55,679
And didn't even say that we deserve to die in a true nuclear war

1651
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Going to have

1652
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,799
Give him an asphalt in the Russia false-flag two-tone collapse

1653
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,919
So you can give him another little bit of a Mark here and that is the 10,000

1654
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,247
For what other all the problems that he has

1655
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Does not trust poop

1656
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
And Rec

1657
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,367
Noises certain

1658
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,927
That are clearly propaganda

1659
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,255
Pro Christian talk

1660
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,607
People to have children

1661
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Sushiman on TV

1662
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,191
Why do you say

1663
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,031
George Soros coming out

1664
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,615
And really dabbling

1665
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,175
China was before

1666
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,199
Why are they admitting it now

1667
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,039
Answer the question

1668
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
This is Matt

1669
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
To deceive

1670
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
This is a major

1671
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,183
Conservatives

1672
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,231
In the United States into

1673
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,863
Is our savior and I get emails all the time.

1674
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
Wilshire is against the New World Order

1675
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,239
Exposing at least partially

1676
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,871
The globalist in their support of Isis in Syria Center bombing those convoys

1677
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,943
But the whole thing about building churches

1678
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,783
And the support of Christianity is a total fraud

1679
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,599
This is

1680
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:23,999
Don't listen to the show anymore

1681
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
You've got too much going on

1682
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:29,119
You really run

1683
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:35,519
Ginger when you have been on for years

1684
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,871
For you to take them seriously to take them as actual experts because

1685
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
This isn't

1686
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Just like some

1687
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
Some assholes saying this

1688
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
You lying about the

1689
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Does religiosity

1690
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:52,927
Conspiracy second-generation conspiracy absolutely

1691
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Alex is not happy

1692
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,279
I think you so unhappy that he just

1693
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,351
Basically like I'm done with this in it

1694
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,167
Where can I pick up seats in the House

1695
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,471
And will retain control of the Senate

1696
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,335
Complete

1697
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
Air Forces

1698
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:16,735
Going to make a very sophisticated and get prepared to make sure that we don't win

1699
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
The presidency again in 2020

1700
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,111
What else should we watch

1701
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
Back to eating lunch

1702
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,303
During interview

1703
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,839
Bulshit people

1704
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:35,679
God damn it I can't be mad at you

1705
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,215
I can eat

1706
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
My feelings

1707
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,567
So we've got this guy's I'm coming in

1708
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,407
Just destroying the fear of nuclear war narratives

1709
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,967
Putin's not a good dude calling out that

1710
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
PR

1711
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,319
Propaganda campaign that Alex has fallen for a man

1712
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,647
Oh no scales and just to make the

1713
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
Hat trick

1714
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,695
Has to

1715
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,231
If you makes a point to bring

1716
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,047
Basalt

1717
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,119
Because he he doesn't like that these are these

1718
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,399
Conservative Outlets

1719
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Conspiracy sites

1720
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
Have been promoting

1721
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,360
That weirdo G giant giant do it no no no no no you can't do that man

1722
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,640
Hellboy

1723
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Let me throw this out cuz I

1724
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,968
I cover the Saturday and Sunday

1725
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Gathered that they were doing a

1726
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
People's grand jury

1727
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,232
198 waves Pentagon talks about

1728
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,048
Civil disobedience

1729
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
Put the song to the show grand juries

1730
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
In other bodies the blueprints

1731
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
Are you saying

1732
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,336
That that you saw area for wasn't in Clearwater or what's happening

1733
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,456
The entire internet is alive

1734
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:56,576
Impression that he's actually filed students

1735
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:03,232
And I want to make sure people understand that isn't true

1736
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,144
Cute as a model for other grand jury so then

1737
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:17,568
Yeah but you can't do that and it's not a model there never will be a grand jury in the first place

1738
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,456
Should be filing a civil suit where you don't need a grand jury

1739
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
They just common citizens

1740
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,832
And the prosecutors

1741
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,952
Grand jury to really discuss the conspiratorial evidence

1742
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,024
Then you got a house conspiratorial proof

1743
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:41,888
Which none of that open

1744
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,704
You don't have Sansa transcripts

1745
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:51,360
A collusion between fauci and the vaccine manufacturers and you can't prove they're lying excetera

1746
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:59,296
First of all there is a logistical reality that skousen recognizes that Alex doesn't which I think is really funny

1747
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
But

1748
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,648
And a little bit too much at the a witch

1749
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
You can't really do this in a grand jury cuz you don't have proof

1750
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
Reduce conspiratorial proof what's going on what happened to skousen did he get hit in the head

1751
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:18,496
Maybe somebody hit him in the head with a pan like a cartoon and he just woke up one day was like

1752
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
Maybe I should tell people that they don't have proof

1753
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,664
That's that's what's fascinating about his tone

1754
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,736
He's recognizing there is no proof proof

1755
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,808
But he also seems to be of the mind that

1756
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
Quote on quote

1757
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,112
Conspiratorial proof

1758
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:37,696
Is good enough away shyn

1759
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,488
Belief

1760
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,096
Yeah I mean his literal point is

1761
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:50,240
You can't take this to a place where a grand jury is required who have to go to a different

1762
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
Court you have to go to a civil court

1763
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
So a grand jury has nothing

1764
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
To do with it

1765
01:22:55,104 --> 01:23:01,248
I think you didn't have trouble in a civil court but I think you have a lot of trouble as it'll go

1766
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,320
Too much of an awareness

1767
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
That there's no proof for the thing

1768
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,696
They believe him

1769
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,560
I have not heard him really just start saying throwing around we don't have proof

1770
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,144
Well we know that fauci did all this stuff

1771
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Movie Cabaret

1772
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,776
We'll see that's a problem because you say you can prove how we know if we feel it

1773
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,360
Feels right I agree

1774
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
Again

1775
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,920
Okay

1776
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,480
Wait what

1777
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,856
Prove okay well then prove it

1778
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
So this dirt bikes

1779
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,000
This interview with the skeleton was a little

1780
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
For Alex

1781
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
And

1782
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,840
I feel like he got a little delayed

1783
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,400
And

1784
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,216
You said that though

1785
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,752
You've got the

1786
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
The Alex

1787
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,288
Signal

1788
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Waylon Richardson

1789
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
For some reason I'm sure it's important

1790
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
I'm going to be on the 1st

1791
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
Alongside

1792
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,344
I'm coming up

1793
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,184
So is Ben like we need to Alec we got it

1794
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,488
I'm hosting the fourth hour but

1795
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
Bombshells

1796
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,584
Too big to not have AJ

1797
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,936
Right there big news is that he is a interview Trump

1798
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
And so he's got to

1799
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,848
Big Newman hot guy

1800
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,200
This is about how I believe

1801
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
The trumps

1802
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
Be the Speaker of the House

1803
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,064
And I'm sorry what hold on okay

1804
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,600
Not only does

1805
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,880
Wayne Allyn root believe this

1806
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,464
Other people ascribe the idea to someone else

1807
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:52,352
People say that Steve Bannon came up with that idea it's my idea

1808
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
Dammit

1809
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,936
I want to take credit for the warts ideas

1810
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
Well

1811
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:01,056
It's debatable if there was a worse idea of

1812
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,616
Speaker the house

1813
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
Which I was the first kind of country

1814
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
Never bring that idea

1815
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
CB speaker the house

1816
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,808
A lot of people give me credit all the media every time they talking

1817
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,368
They say when root asked him about it

1818
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,184
But they say Steve Bannon is the one

1819
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
First

1820
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
Not true

1821
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,768
She better brought up in

1822
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
In February of 2021

1823
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,840
I wrote about it

1824
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,144
Nationally syndicated column

1825
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,424
In January

1826
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,704
A 2021

1827
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,728
And I said

1828
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
Trump should become Speaker of the House

1829
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
At lead

1830
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
Open LED

1831
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
Applications

1832
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,408
Criminal investigations against

1833
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,944
Everything is about

1834
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
How to do

1835
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,248
That we know will destroy this country

1836
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,112
Be speaker of the house I put my

1837
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
Lightfoot

1838
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Again

1839
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
Will you

1840
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,232
Be willing to be Speaker of the House

1841
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,536
He didn't say no

1842
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
Which is very interesting

1843
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,424
I hope we don't need that we shouldn't need that

1844
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,872
House CD where he wants to do it and then and then they would vote him at his finger

1845
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
That would be amazing

1846
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,760
I don't think it would happen but also Wayne Allyn root

1847
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,552
Here's two things

1848
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
Things that are f***** up if you want

1849
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:22,720
Trump to come in and investigate the guy who beat him in an election

1850
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,536
Weirdly healthy conflict

1851
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,096
Very healthy for political system

1852
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,912
The second thing is that he wants him to investigate Biden

1853
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
For future crimes

1854
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
Crimes that he we know he will

1855
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Commit

1856
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,568
That's really messed up

1857
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,592
Now I'll tell you this

1858
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,616
Has a problem

1859
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:43,968
If I take the results of that Invicta investigation to a grand jury

1860
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,784
They are not going to believe it's due probably not

1861
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,808
If not really

1862
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,088
Future crime

1863
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Proof.

1864
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,440
So Alex looks like

1865
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:57,280
Trump can get this house eat and then he'll become the Speaker of the House

1866
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Wayne

1867
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
Believes that there's a quicker route

1868
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:04,704
Oh my God tell me about it this is where Alex I think even is just like

1869
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,776
I sent it to surrounded by idiots

1870
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,872
Anybody could be Speaker of the House

1871
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,664
After we win

1872
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,968
After the Republicans control the house

1873
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
No message

1874
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,272
You can vote in

1875
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,880
You can dominate that

1876
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,912
But but it's clear to me he doesn't want to do that

1877
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
I'd rather make an easy form now

1878
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
All you have to do instead of running

1879
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,824
Is be nominated for Speaker of the House

1880
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,872
And if the new house election

1881
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
I don't believe so but that doesn't mean

1882
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,880
Anything can happen in this world

1883
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,928
If you have enough momentum anything can happen

1884
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah man

1885
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:06,144
How to speaker wasn't from the house you can be elected even if you're not in the house

1886
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
That's

1887
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
Never going to happen

1888
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,544
This is a wacky can-do spirit that isn't body and go

1889
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,360
That is something he's got he's got ID

1890
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Bad idea

1891
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:21,504
Google

1892
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
Tons of jobs that

1893
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,368
The speaker takes on from an administrative and party leadership position

1894
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,672
The GOP would be interested in having

1895
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
Trump be

1896
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,744
HR jobs

1897
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
Leaving it alone the fact I'd like Trump doesn't want that much work

1898
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
Also

1899
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,608
View motherfuker

1900
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,144
Like Alex and Wayne

1901
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,496
Did they can agitate all they want about how their leadership in congress is weak and ineffective

1902
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,776
But in the real world

1903
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,800
The greatest

1904
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,592
GIF they could give the Democrats

1905
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,640
It's somehow throwing out Mitch McConnell

1906
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,200
Hey Kevin McCarthy and replacing them with some inapt

1907
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:54,272
Diplomatic lightweight who wouldn't be able to Rally the caucus

1908
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,856
StarTalk amazement that I have four

1909
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,136
Conservatives who are like

1910
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
Mitch McConnell's got to go are like

1911
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,512
Have you guys not been around Mitch McConnell

1912
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,864
Has successfully kicked the entire ass of the United States for 30 years

1913
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,008
He's very effective my world

1914
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,312
That's something

1915
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:24,480
Higher higher value for the used vehicles

1916
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,296
GOP he stole the Supreme Court seats

1917
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,856
And then successfully got two more

1918
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:34,976
He is destroyed the entirety of the Supreme Court for the rest of the United States history

1919
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:38,304
Not a real court anymore

1920
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,608
That cannot be achieved

1921
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,144
With a lesser

1922
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,936
Party leader

1923
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,032
Have the ability to negotiate with various

1924
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
Parts of the caucus

1925
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,872
And get everybody on the same page it just

1926
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
Would not have work

1927
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,664
And

1928
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,200
I don't think that

1929
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,992
People like Alex necessarily

1930
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,320
Care about that or recognize me important

1931
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,368
Cancel that

1932
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:07,744
F****** Matt gaetz in there and we'll run

1933
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
Your party fracture

1934
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,864
Get people to come on board as idea

1935
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,216
That Trump is this big super strong man who we need to have leave

1936
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
The country B

1937
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,080
Well because he doesn't say that he want to do it I'm going to make it easy

1938
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:26,944
For a big strong man to not have to work hard

1939
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,992
At all and I hate Mitch

1940
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:29,760
McConnell

1941
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,808
Who is successfully steered this

1942
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:35,904
Entire country

1943
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
I hate that

1944
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:39,232
That guy give me the lazy ass hoe

1945
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,256
Also

1946
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
Just from a

1947
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,072
Odds

1948
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,096
Perspective

1949
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:49,984
Like we already talked about this when Marjorie Taylor Greene was on the talk about her becoming the Speaker of the House

1950
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,288
There's no way you'd rally the kind of vote

1951
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
So you need

1952
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
The cheese in the house

1953
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,176
Buick Rallye indicado votes necessary to like

1954
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,200
Get Trump

1955
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,992
Out-of-office

1956
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,784
Tubi

1957
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,088
Riverhouse former president

1958
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,368
It's just

1959
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
Possible there's no way

1960
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,440
I mean Irish

1961
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
I like

1962
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
The acknowledgement

1963
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
That Trump

1964
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Shouldn't

1965
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:19,680
And couldn't have become president unless we live in a topsy-turvy world and anything can happen

1966
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
But I'm going to go out on a limb here and I'm going to save this

1967
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,824
Is one of the few things that absolutely cannot happen

1968
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Crazy world

1969
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
I still think this is

1970
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,736
Not going to happen

1971
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:39,136
And I recognize also chocolate Speaker of the House in McConnell's in the Senate and all that but

1972
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
The point still stands

1973
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,720
In terms of

1974
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,000
At the rally.

1975
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,072
McCarthyism

1976
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
But

1977
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,400
The impact of trying

1978
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
To unseat

1979
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,448
These people who are

1980
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
Very effective

1981
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,520
Party leaders is

1982
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
Stupid it is it's amazing

1983
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,384
It is amazing like

1984
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,736
Genuinely if the Democrats had somebody like Mitch McConnell it would have been

1985
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,624
And instead we with Nancy Pelosi has a hundred million dollars

1986
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,904
So that's nice

1987
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:18,048
Yeah so we come to the end of this and I feel like this episode had a fun Ark

1988
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,096
A bit much is Alex's

1989
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,400
Obsessed with the the

1990
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,216
Nuclear war and then skousen ruins at the end

1991
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,264
Sky Zone kicked him a couple more time

1992
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,288
Just a

1993
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,080
A little kid

1994
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,128
Holding birthday balloons

1995
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,176
As skousen goes up with a pen and just

1996
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
No no

1997
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,272
Pop Anthony looks at him

1998
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:45,184
Alex is a goddamn Nazi on to talk about the the truckers

1999
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,000
Anti

2000
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,816
