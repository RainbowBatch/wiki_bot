00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,312
Play everybody look

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,920
Sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Jones

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,576
To the end of this adventure

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,416
The thrilling conclusion if you will of our coverage

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
The Obama Deception

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
It has been real

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,448
Real Whirlwind guys something

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,776
Seen a lot of the hot b******* Alex making up quote

11
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,360
Store people he has on the documentary Making up quotes

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,504
We've seen Ron Paul's brother say incredibly ludicrous thing

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,088
Seemed every single actor in this documentary

14
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,952
Be unable to grasp what the actual nature of the Federal Reserve

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:07,328
It's just been atrocious as an outing on Alex's parts

16
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
It's good that we can finally put this in the ground as it were an end

17
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
What's today's episode

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,872
But before we get to that I'd like to take a little moment

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
Very excited too

20
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,272
First of all I'd like to say thank you so much

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
Thank you so much

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Paul you are now a policy wonk

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,632
Thank you so much for supporting the show if you're listening out there and you thinking hey it's Black Friday

25
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
What do I go

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
As soon as I came out of my mouth

27
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
Ugly

28
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Disgusting.

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
Take that out of there

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Strike it from the record

31
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,272
If you will go to our website

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
It says support the show

33
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
Appreciate it

34
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Now a conclusion

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Of The Obama Deception

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
4r

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Podcast

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
To get sloppy

39
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
Kind of

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Not

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Attract

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
Maybe I'm not sure if you're waiting for the boy will resort to lose it

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
I think you'll find it in this episode this is kind of

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Blue contacts that believe

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
This was recorded this is all over me and Jordan sitting around and talking about this

46
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Documentary

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,392
In one in one sitting so of course we were sort of losing our minds and

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
I think Jordan

49
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Kind of checks out

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Pretty hard

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
I'm not sitting here

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,936
It's a real Dynamic of Jordan having checked out addition to being kind of angry at Alex

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
Me realizing we just got to get through this and tried to make it to the finish line

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,152
We left off

55
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Alex

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,760
Just made up another quote we were discussing

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,856
Entirely flat

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
So let's get back into it so much for listening

59
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
I will see you next week after this for

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Regular

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Regularly-scheduled podcast alright

62
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
We have all been held Within

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
The

64
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Jail cell

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
That ponytail for

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
That jail

67
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
Now that the bankers were holding World hostage

68
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
Issued their ultimatum

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
The only solution to restart the global economy would be to set up a planetary government

70
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
Buy a new Bank of the world

71
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,640
Hundreds of prominent Publications announced the soldiers but he's shown to

72
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Salvation

73
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
You don't say

74
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
You saying what they say

75
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
These are opinion

76
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
We're individuals have

77
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Explorer

78
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
The new banking

79
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
These people as in the case right

80
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Conceived by line Justin Fox there

81
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,863
He wrote for Time Magazine

82
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
English writing

83
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Suggestions

84
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Does ideas

85
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
Also fun fact in May 2009 Johnson

86
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Fox wrote an article published

87
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
By time

88
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
About how everyone should listen to Peter Schiff

89
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
Alex's favorite Austrian School of economics

90
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
That's not just my interpretation

91
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
The Articles literally

92
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Entitled quote

93
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
Why we should listen to Peter Schiff bad news

94
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Dojo

95
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
What's on Fox this guy who wrote this article

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
To complain about

97
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,375
He's working for the globalist new world

98
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Consistent

99
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,847
This fairly obscure Economist who want to destroy the things that

100
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Used to make all their money

101
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Yeah that makes sense

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Multitude

103
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Dad

104
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Is saying it is

105
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
They're talking about

106
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Creating a new World Bank

107
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Bank of existence

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,447
Before you don't have to create a new World Bank

109
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Is there

110
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,359
What is it called is it called some sort of international monetary fund

111
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
Connected

112
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Who's going to make

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Time Magazine an article titled the new world orders of adjustments control the world's currencies

114
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Knock the heads

115
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
The bad countries

116
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Like the United States

117
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
So we are my posit here so you can see a little bit of attacks but also like

118
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
The courthouse is referring to from this article doesn't pay that the bank

119
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
I should knock you as his head

120
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
It says

121
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
In the view of many outside the US and within

122
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,391
The only limit such a is through bigger more powerful is a bigger more powerful

123
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
They can act as the central banks

124
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
To the world and knock heads when needed

125
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Importantly the prior paragraph provide

126
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Provides

127
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Text about what this mean

128
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Discusses how

129
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,447
In the 1980s China and India learns at their best

130
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Toward US dollars

131
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Protecting their currency

132
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
Which it turns out isn't a good system

133
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Either

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Justin Fox

135
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
Isn't saying there should be a new bigger IMS

136
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
He's just expressing that some people feel that there should be

137
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
And in his article explains

138
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Why that's all that's going on

139
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,927
Well no I mean the continuing question

140
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
From what I can read

141
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Should Capital flows be

142
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Should there be limits on trade.

143
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Surpluses

144
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Should the IMF be able to order round

145
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Even the unit

146
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Us

147
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
If the answer to any of these questions is yes

148
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Global capitalism

149
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Will have entered a new and dramatically less

150
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Freewheeling error

151
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
If this happened

152
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
It doesn't seem like that

153
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
The positive reaction

154
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,959
Going off of like I Googled it now.

155
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
If

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,455
If any of this situation is so terrible that

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
We have to then

158
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Give so much power to the IMF

159
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,623
Then that is Dramatical a bigger IMS

160
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
The power irrevocably

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Forever

162
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
That's a big part of what he saying

163
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,607
Which he's not he's not implying is a good

164
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Advocating for it

165
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
No

166
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Know how to read

167
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,639
At a meeting of Central Bank heads and finance ministers dub

168
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
Bretton Woods to the plan

169
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,271
The world government was unveiled by the very bankers

170
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
That engineered the collapse

171
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
Formerly Sovereign countries

172
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,463
Would now pay their taxes directly to the banking cartel

173
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,863
Hundreds of new carbon taxes controlling every facet of human activity would only

174
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
We be the beginning

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
So God we're getting into

176
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
Bretton Woods 2

177
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:49,151
Do you know about brentwood's agreement that was made

178
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
It was about the world's economy becoming more interconnected

179
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
The 1940

180
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
And the international realization that they needed

181
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
To make sure there was more mechanisms in place

182
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
So is it country is could cooperate

183
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Currencies could be traded with simplicity

184
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
So they created an exchange

185
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
They created a way that they

186
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Trade currency

187
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Easily cry cuz that is very important

188
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
International trade

189
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Was the first participating countries agreed

190
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Debase the currency of their value is

191
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
But the US insisted that the dollar should also

192
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Reserved

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Not too surprising

194
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Play seeing as the US was

195
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The biggest tower in the world

196
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Or one of the only countries not comply

197
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Be devastated

198
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
Economically by World War

199
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
We got our way

200
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
When Nixon.

201
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Us off the gold standard night

202
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
1571

203
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
The default

204
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Reserved

205
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Based on the Bretton Woods system

206
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Now we no longer

207
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Part of

208
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
By the way

209
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Bretton Woods to was a meeting of international economies Express

210
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Concerned about the world

211
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Michael system

212
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
Particularly that little thing

213
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
Where anytime the US has economic

214
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
Trouble the trouble ripples through every country's economy

215
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Because the world reserved

216
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Along with ours

217
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
And that's a good thing

218
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Brightburn your country isn't that what the

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,543
These countries were looking to start up a new world

220
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Themselves from us

221
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Particularly after our guy would you want to protect yourself we're doing good

222
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
Democracy

223
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
I mean after all our shoddy record

224
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
2008

225
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Like what we did to the world

226
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
I mean it wasn't

227
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,631
We played a big role

228
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
You are a team effort

229
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Billionaires

230
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Sure but

231
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
There was a lot of things

232
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Spin it

233
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Like that's what Bretton Woods to was

234
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Mostly about

235
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
News about the idea that people wanted to disc

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Connect from our economy

237
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Not that they wanted

238
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
There's one argument Alex could conceivably used

239
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Make his globulus Target

240
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
That is that

241
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Other than the dollar

242
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Probably the only

243
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Realistic

244
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Do they could use was

245
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Gyro

246
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
You could say that they were

247
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Shift to the euro

248
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
There's a place in Sgt it's dog

249
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
But it's mostly of how getting away from us

250
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Yeah so I don't know I mean

251
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
Is there is there is one good thing

252
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
To be sad about Trump being press

253
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
Which is that finally the rest

254
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Save the world

255
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Has taken the advice that I gave them 10 years

256
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Witches

257
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Do not trust America

258
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
At all ever

259
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,375
If you go into any negotiations with America

260
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Belie

261
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
No matter what and now everybody knows we

262
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Are it's nice

263
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
Exactly

264
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
It might happen to you good luck

265
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Record World I'll be in France

266
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,647
It's like any history book where you read the the Fraser and then the white man came

267
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
And you're like

268
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Who is like the beginning of a horror movie

269
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
Like now we we have Trump in office everybody knows on the global scale

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
The white man is it

271
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Avoid

272
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
I want to go to France

273
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Anyway it's not going to help but

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
What do in France

275
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Macarons pretty bad too

276
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Macron

277
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Want to go print

278
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Easter Island

279
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Nah

280
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,255
Now all the elite had to do was to sell the public on accepting the Final Phase of their teiko

281
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
And it's Obama's job to succor the pub

282
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
In the standing down

283
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
So the bankers agenda can move forward unhindered

284
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,359
Before 11, right there the media gotten behind a present

285
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
Like they are behind Obama

286
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
The Press has pulled out all the stops

287
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,599
Give me some credit he was f****** great man

288
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Great

289
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,047
I know this is also a post factual's after when he made the documentary

290
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
You could make that same

291
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Man about Trump

292
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
Like a lot of the media was

293
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Presumably negative

294
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,775
Yes but they gave him as his eyes much

295
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:37,151
Attention and has no play on how much free advertisement

296
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
Billions of dollars

297
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Just be a thing where Alex is

298
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Recognizing a trend

299
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Started with Obama

300
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Like in terms of

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
The media oversaturating

302
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,327
Like God might be thing where he's like

303
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
He's accurately pointing

304
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Medias do too much here

305
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Right not recognizing that it's not

306
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Because it's Obama it right back

307
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,847
Now what they do with politics

308
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
In this shot right here

309
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,807
Way too on the nose

310
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,671
It's the Seal of the president of the United States

311
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
Fresco of him with Jesus's Halo like

312
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Look

313
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
Louisville

314
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
I would not have liked I wiggle

315
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Too on the nose

316
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,687
The cameraman or knock that field

317
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,575
Throwing a crown of infallibility upon Obama as the savior of the people

318
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
The elite are betting everything they've got

319
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Obama's charisma

320
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
And hoping that he can sell the world

321
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
Summer program

322
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Between

323
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
America

324
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Whataburger

325
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
A change of leadership

326
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Will not let this go

327
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
European

328
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
It is the only one

329
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
What the f*** is he playing that making you evil

330
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,007
I don't play that

331
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Isn't it scary

332
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Not least of which not least of which that all of those all those features are even more specifically like

333
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
If you go back and read those are more rebuke to us

334
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
The people who voted for Obama than anybody else

335
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
Words like all of his speeches are

336
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
We need to come together

337
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
We need to do this together

338
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
All of you need to participate

339
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
Every one of you needs to be a part of this

340
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Please don't just expect me to do this

341
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
And we were all like

342
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Researched his own

343
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,599
Failure it is certain except again like this is another example of like

344
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Alex is playing these

345
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
Heine clips of Obama speeches

346
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:36,351
Veteran ice I noticed it where we were both silently watching

347
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
Great like if you watch the entire speech

348
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
Also f****** great throughout like eight pieces

349
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
It's not

350
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Some sort at 90 hit Alcazar

351
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
No problem

352
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
He has if not at powers and you guys are just falling for it. That

353
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Great orator

354
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Make

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
I want

356
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
And

357
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
That are uplifting

358
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Right

359
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
Now weather weather

360
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Involved in government he's able to

361
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
Anything away from the speeches

362
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
Anything away from what you

363
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
You feel when you

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Hear it I wish I had

365
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,175
Elizabeth Warren in

366
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,463
That's why the first two years of Obama's presidency

367
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,863
That's what we're going to see over and over and over again prediction

368
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
5 coins

369
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
Gerald

370
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
No does the one

371
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
The one stretch of time

372
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Where

373
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Babe

374
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
A truly Progressive agenda could have been

375
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Run roughshod

376
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Over the s*** of America

377
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Destroyed

378
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
And ultimately

379
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
By losing those first two years we lost every

380
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,519
At the time it seemed like the right thing to do and in hindsight probably wasn't

381
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
To do because

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
We thought we were ready for a black president

383
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Thought we were dealing with rational people

384
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Rational

385
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,047
We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see

386
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
That's a llama is not simply continuing

387
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
George W bush

388
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Two policies

389
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
He is radically expanding

390
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Okay thanks

391
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Proservice tornado

392
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
That was just in my list

393
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
The classy move

394
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,623
You know bush like Obama will be

395
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
The kind of petty person to

396
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
Complain about the burdens of office

397
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Obama when he's being

398
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Handed the presidency

399
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Thanking bush

400
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Forget service.

401
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
Me and that he endorses Bush's policies

402
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
It just me like what do you want to do pull out like a dick and piss on him

403
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Like what would be appropriate

404
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Like him

405
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Karmic

406
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
Global pulling out of sick actually would be

407
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,367
Can you imagine what the blogs would do if

408
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
The first black presidential candidate

409
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,887
Virginia imagine the Scandal that would come from

410
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
The first black president of all time

411
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
And United States

412
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Is rude

413
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
To his predecessor every other president was very nice to all the others

414
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Yeah.

415
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,551
This film is documented the painful.

416
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,599
Of what he has claimed it to be

417
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Also by the way this documentary has demonstrated

418
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
No

419
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Barack Obama

420
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
And his controller

421
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
Screw agenda

422
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Holy s*** we're an hour and

423
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
45 minutes to reveal what the

424
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:28,543
F*** the point is is the end of this documentary coming into the home stretch

425
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Yeah it's a little bit

426
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
Now we come to Alex trying to make

427
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
His like

428
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
It's

429
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Hughes

430
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
F******

431
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Like

432
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Thesis

433
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
Yeah it's a 10-part fuses

434
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
Europe Europe

435
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
We well you

436
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
It's a 10 party funeral mission

437
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
And then you submit your stasis

438
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Nevermind he didn't go to college

439
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
Stop

440
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
Was never called upon to committing probably Terrain

441
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Any papers yet

442
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
But like he

443
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
He's going to try and make

444
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Eastpointe

445
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
These are

446
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
S***

447
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
I'll say this

448
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Yeah

449
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Alex

450
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Number one

451
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Bring the United States

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
All of the complete regulatory control

453
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
Of a private offshore super Bank

454
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Known as the bank of the world

455
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
More than 100 new tax

456
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Are now being developed

457
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Under the umbrella

458
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Of curbing greenhouse-gas

459
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
The new taxes we pay directly to the private bank and source

460
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
At the producer level

461
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
Taxes will be paid on farm animals

462
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
On all forms of me

463
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Beef

464
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Poultry

465
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Pork and fish

466
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,144
It's important to note that within that b-roll right there was a stretch where he was zeroing in on certain

467
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Certain parts of article

468
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Break

469
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
But then for no reason

470
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
He just zeroed in on a

471
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Cow's udder

472
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:09,920
Bright like if they were there was just like beer all of a cow and then all the sudden for no reason is just like

473
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760
What

474
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,600
A couple times you pointed out this is a poorly edited

475
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Poorly edited

476
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,256
So is first piece of the big plans globalist have for Obama

477
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,608
Yeah is to bring the u.s. into a new super World Bank

478
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
That's the underlying

479
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Grandma's best before the whole time

480
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
I will say that I will judge this

481
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
Nor did they ever really try to make it happen

482
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,200
Making this up by misreading that Newsweek article that he flashed up on screen

483
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
Mission number one

484
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,392
No right make this happen

485
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
So we're we're over one on

486
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
Put an accident

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
Put a checkmark when the global is 60

488
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
And also all these articles keeps posting

489
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
Put it up on screen hear about these taxes

490
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
FaceTime suggestions people

491
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Not really on anything that's ever gone

492
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Through

493
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,944
Like none of these are real taxes but Alex is acting like is already a plan to put in place a laundry

494
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,528
In America are like

495
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Indian journalists

496
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Call Missy

497
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
But I mean not even like

498
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Somebody who works for the administration

499
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
Or a press release of

500
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
Announces laundry Tech

501
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
That's a source I would take

502
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
Not real buddy saying

503
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:43,616
Hey laundry is hurting the environment not I got nothing

504
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
On that I got nothing on that

505
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
Decided to say something

506
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Can do can go

507
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,768
Someone wants to write that someone wants to print it that's all it takes

508
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
It doesn't mean that its government

509
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
Anyone's taking it seriously

510
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Like it is

511
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
He acts like all these suggestions

512
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
Somehow or miraculously going to be

513
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Your new oppression

514
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
It's just nonsense

515
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Old cars

516
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
Will be fitted with satellite tracking boxes

517
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
Applejack's driving by the miles

518
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
Encoding motor oil and natural gas

519
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
Old plastic

520
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Products will have a carpenter

521
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,376
Not if I'm going to count that one for Chicago baby ate that

522
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Not a federal tax

523
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216
Cuz that's available tax

524
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,568
7/10 everybody Pace attack

525
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,384
Bethel local tax

526
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
No it's not

527
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,040
He only cares about federal tax alright well then

528
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,392
They're in the same weight part of number one

529
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,744
You still part of metal part of the global superpower

530
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
But like

531
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Taxes in Suffolk

532
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Like that

533
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
That doesn't exist on a federal level but it does exist in like California

534
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
That is their right to

535
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,336
To do that that's a state

536
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,920
States are not allowed to have

537
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
They are allowed to

538
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Continue to have

539
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,624
That's the only thing I know

540
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
No gays

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
No taxes

542
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,560
If you have texts make a cool cuz that is not at all federal taxes

543
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,632
But there are examples of them on state or local levels

544
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
She shouldn't complain about

545
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Exactly

546
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Until then

547
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,848
Until it's not what I agree with

548
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
If you

549
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Don't

550
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,968
Federal government

551
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Little more than that after it when I paid for it so I can

572
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
The movie Walgreens with a central bank Walgreens scam

573
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Now here's

574
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Here's my big

575
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Alright

576
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Broly

577
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
And these are played out

578
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
The globe

579
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:23,008
Is there an exclamation

580
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,688
Play text

581
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Call Bates electric Tech

582
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Sure

583
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
The Earth is an apple

584
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Trash pickup

585
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,392
If it's a private service that does it

586
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Who's going to be at Exxon

587
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Like it because it's if it's a public service

588
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Most of the time

589
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
Your landlord will take care of it I mean where rent

590
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Some stuff like

591
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,568
Most people are renters in there in Chicago that I know and your building generally takes care of it

592
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
But your landlord is tax

593
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
There's services

594
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,272
Since none of this is really

595
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,088
They don't know

596
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:16,512
I get it

597
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
30 bucks to get your trash picked up

598
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
So everybody pays a little bit of other things that already

599
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
So Furious

600
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Steel production

601
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Mining

602
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Clothing

603
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Laundry

604
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Asphalt

605
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Are just a few of the new tax

606
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Is the Beloved

607
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,696
Those are all all depends on what you're doing with

608
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
But if you're buying clothes

609
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,888
If you're producing clothes

610
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
There's some sort of tax return

611
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,128
Lord I don't know I'm not sure what he's mad about but if it's that then

612
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,248
I still don't care to build that f****** roadman

613
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
That goddamn Road

614
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
From the ravages of climate change

615
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
We need

616
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Ultimately make

617
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Clean renewable energy

618
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
The profitable

619
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Kind of

620
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
So I asked

621
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
This congressman

622
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Find me legislation

623
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
The place is a market-based cap

624
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
On carbon pollution

625
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
And drives

626
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
Production of more renewable energy in

627
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
In America

628
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
I'm not

629
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Anybody

630
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
The other time

631
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Do something

632
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
But Obama is talking about

633
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
50%

634
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Of America agree

635
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
That you should do so

636
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,392
56% says it's the wrong idea

637
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Obama right there isn't talking about carbon taxes which is what Alex was

638
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Before they do talk about camping

639
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Trade which isn't it

640
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Attack

641
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
It's a system where carbon emission

642
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656
Center cap at certain level

643
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,984
And if a business wants to admit more than their logic

644
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
No

645
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
They're not taxed

646
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,384
Taxation by those admissions Unit A, another company that does

647
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,528
It's not a perfect system

648
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
F***** with ax

649
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,648
Get hurt climate progress all that stuff but texting me with your words

650
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
It's not attack

651
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Extensive it could be

652
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Cap and trade

653
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Doesn't affect

654
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Non-kin

655
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,168
Consumers don't get affected by that all it only involves people who run these businesses

656
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
That pollute

657
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
If there is

658
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Carbon emission

659
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,152
There's another

660
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
No I know I understand that

661
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
That everyone know everywhere

662
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Portrayed

663
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Contacts can be used

664
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Possibly

665
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,512
Cap-and-trade could be a good way to.

666
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,120
Yeah in Subway's

667
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Feel like

Friday

669
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
It's too late

670
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
So let's not worry

671
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Just because anything

672
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Feels like it's too late doesn't mean

673
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
Do something

674
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,664
I know I'm not saying or not but

675
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
You during the war for water

676
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504

I'm not going to donate to the show

684
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Obviously

685
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Play Garba Jackson

686
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Affect

687
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,576
Just wait we have the pantheon of certain normal suggest

688
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Also, Traders are really

689
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
Reasonable Middle Ground

690
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Help

691
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,584
Will might be more able to

692
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Accept it

693
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,496
I'm not going to get the best way to go nothing is perfect and it also creates commodity out of the the carbon

694
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,128
Nobody is buying my plan to recreate Avalanche

695
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
With Barrett and cloud and yuffie

696
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
And take down

697
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248

Everybody here

Great a Final Fantasy 7 references

703
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
The notion of

704
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
Anthropogenic global warming

705
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,800
Is a fraud the idea that the planet is getting warmer

706
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
And the human activity

707
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Is a pseudo-scientific

708
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,784
Fraud Wilford Brimley

709
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
I think I'm fascinated by him because of

710
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:05,024
How unable I am to pinpoint exactly the weird world

711
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
I know which is weird

712
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
It's not weird it falls in line with a lot of

713
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
The other

714
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
Crustaceans that I have

715
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
But his his

718
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,176
And he's still being on Genesis Communications Network

719
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Is to exert too much for me to understand

720
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,648
Have like like a certain amount of

721
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
I'm a Breaking Point

722
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Like whiskey

727
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
Just go f*** this guy

728
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Libertarianism

729
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
The fraud

730
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Hey Ron Paul is a f****** a******

731
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,712
Words that I would see him and talk about like mischaracterization

732
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Carol Quickly's

733
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Books like I know what you're up to. Haven't begged

734
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Then

735
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Bring that anyway

736
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
I don't know what

737
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,584
You are now a rogue variable

738
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,144
Spell for sure still alive

739
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,216
Denial stuff go straight along with

740
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
The libertarian

741
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
It is very easy to

742
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
Compartmentalize that into

743
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
That world

744
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
Very heavily funded by Coca

745
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Pinterest

746
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
Big tobacco that's hurt

747
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
Like that

748
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
If Alex is someone in Alex Jones

749
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
This world is a climate

750
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
All right right

751
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah that's

752
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Yeah

753
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Just an anomaly

754
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
That Siri

755
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
Perhaps no

756
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Pitch

757
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
Where is he

758
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Right now

759
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Actually

760
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Find an old phone

761
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
But I don't think so

762
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Japan

763
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Waiting at bleeding

764
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
No

765
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
So we we knock a little hole in the sky

766
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
And you and I

767
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,792
Some straws in there and we drink his brain and we gain his power

768
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
What do you think

769
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Agree to that

770
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,848
What is what is left for him

771
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
Something greater

772
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
We have an idea we have an idea

773
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
I know that we just said we're going to eat brains don't listen to that. Don't worry about it

774
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Avid turn around

775
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Where does where does

776
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Justin

777
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
If you're Elizabeth

778
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
None of this stuff is going to happen

779
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
That guy make a bandana on you and eat your brains about you

780
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,368
Balaclava are there that covers your head

781
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
There's no way we can put a straw through there

782
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Erase science

783
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Grace Hightower

784
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,352
They said Aryan

785
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
This is where we went

786
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,960
Search Holocaust

787
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Global warming

788
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
Caused by human activity

789
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
And the answer to that is

790
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Carbon tax

791
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Plus

792
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Cap-and-trade

793
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,736
According to the wishes of algor Prince Charles

794
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
And basically the entire

795
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552

796
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
Banking Community the world

797
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
Bigly

798
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,744
In the world of Nazi leaps that

799
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Impressive

800
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Videos

801
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,864
The Nazis had raced eugenics

802
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Climate change

803
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
What

804
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Before we go any further

805
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
The article up

806
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Right now

807
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,616
Is from

808
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,504
Good girl

809
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,904
Clearly

810
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,976
A year-and-a-half old by the time of this documentary

811
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
What they're trying to do with that

812
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Is to perpetuate

813
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,680
The current system where Bankers rule the world financiers rule the world

814
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
Festivus

815
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,872
If you try to put on tattoos that we all wanted waterwoman later on in life

816
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Guess we were wrong.

817
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,456
I did it you're going to save the polar bears

818
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,320
Telegraph

819
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
The deaths will be measured in the hundreds of Millions

820
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
And indeed Independence

821
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
Just the idea of global warming means

822
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
Southeast refrigerators

823
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Any car ever

824
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,056
Jack off motion

825
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
Inspiring

826
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
How much he cares about

827
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
Africa right now

828
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
He cares

829
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,296
Like specifically now

830
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
It's amazing

831
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Kings nuts

832
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
It's important to expose and fight

833
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
The pseudo-scientific fraud of global warming

834
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
One more point

835
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
Climatologist

836
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
YouTube I really wish I did

837
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Historian

838
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,240
I can tell you okay give me a

839
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
We had a period of

840
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Temperatures

841
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
Called the medieval warm.

842
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
Growing very far

843
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
F****** charts charts

844
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,208
Pause this dumb f****** shirt

845
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,864
What's the minimum in there

846
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Later xyx

847
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,216
Alright

848
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
What does that mean

849
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
Carbon-14

850
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
The molecules I assume they're on the other side

851
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
So what is the weather that mean

852
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
Calendar years

853
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
Before

854
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Prometheus

855
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,624
Now if we're going to go by his b*******

856
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,512
We have between 709

857
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
Describing as historic medieval history

858
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Correctly

859
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
What he is saying is that

860
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
The climate exist

861
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
From

862
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
08

863
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
1188 does seem like that is the what the graph is

864
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Because I mean

865
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,440
It's not specified any better than that

866
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
I think that's a limited stamp

867
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
Apple size

868
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
Does he know dinosaurs were real

869
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
I really need that question answered right now

870
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,432
Before we go any further does he know dinosaurs are real or not like a

871
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
That God gave us

872
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
It's not something that came up in this documentary

873
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
I can't favors it looks like

874
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
All time

875
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Maximum

876
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Sunspots

877
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Right now

878
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:49,920
We can save it for the historian

879
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
The limit

880
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
The medieval warm.

881
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
1600

882
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
21650

883
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
There was

884
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Ice Age in

885
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
Northern Europe

886
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
Call Samantha Foster covid-19 response to an all-time minimum

887
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,472
Sunspot activity minimum

888
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
What to do with solar activity

889
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
We can pass

890
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,664
As a result of increased solar activity

891
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
But we're well within the minimum

892
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
With the oligarchs

893
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
Claimed to be an open-and-shut

894
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
Scientific case

895
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Is a piece

896
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,392
Pseudo-scientific nonsense

897
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
And it should be

898
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Rejected

899
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
No that's not true at all

900
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
It is the one

901
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Who

902
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:43,168
Someone who is special interest group would probably say

903
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Damn it's not you have me

904
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
It had me you.

905
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
About a Boy

906
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
It was such a long time

907
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
But that stretch

908
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,687
It that stretch has definitively proven to me

909
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Webster Tarpley

910
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Can take his head

911
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Twisted around

912
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
Stick it up his own ass

913
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,695
And then have it thrown into the f****** son

914
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,327
Like he's he's advocating something that is

915
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
What a moron

916
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:19,007
F****** moron they don't fly matologist to tell you this stuff cuz I was Dory

917
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,735
Recalibrate it so like retroactive

918
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
His money is taken away

919
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,343
Probably

920
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
I think that over the course of this podcast

921
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
A lot of the stuff we talked about

922
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
Has shown that he's not a great historian

923
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
He probably hasn't misplaced ideas about history

924
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,887
So like when he's like you don't need some ideas

925
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
A very nice way of putting

926
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
I went but I want to know those

927
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,159
Irritated climatologist I'm a historian I know these

928
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
I have problems

929
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
Who's your credit is a historian till I also don't take

930
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
That is very seriously

931
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
I bet even beyond that I reject the premise

932
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
You do need a climatologist

933
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,727
You do need it cuz it's very it's very subtle a lot of

934
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,799
That that the Stuffies

935
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Is f****** b*******

936
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
It's nonsense

937
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,687
And I will move on

938
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
You don't need a climatology

939
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
The social engineer

940
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Fully aware

941
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
The Obama craze will wear off quickly

942
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
So they are racing to put in place

943
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
The most impressively state-controlled

944
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,655
Number to get on your horse but you're keeping track of the tenants of

945
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
What Obama supposed to do

946
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
I'm just hitting myself in the face with the microphone

947
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Hitting my face

948
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,943
No it doesn't keep track of

949
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,063
Right now I CX

950
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,159
I see three x's and I understand

951
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,999
Vin Diesel is my God because we don't live in a police state now so

952
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
Mission failed the globalist

953
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
So

954
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
15 point

955
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
But Alex doesn't mention that it dropped 15 points and ended up at 6

956
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Sixty-eight percent as an approval rating

957
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,967
That's not an indication that Obama is first week in August

958
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Well we don't want to say it

959
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:44,159
You bet we're all really excited

960
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,535
Navigation to 15% of the people in the last poll were f****** lying when they said they

961
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,375
3% approval rating is unsustainable

962
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,239
Or an indication that the last bowl wasn't well done something like that

963
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,383
For context Trump in his entire presidency

964
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,455
And that was stick stays into him being an office which is

965
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,551
I'm saying that it was ever that he spent most of his time in the low forties high 30

966
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Which is insane

967
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,487
America's Army troops

968
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Are now being deployed

969
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
Patrol the streets of the United States

970
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Not exactly

971
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
FEMA

972
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
Is now building Giant

973
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:34,847
Every region of the Chester prison like the National Emergency Center

974
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
HR 645

975
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
Which merges local

976
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Send the police

977
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,735
Under Federal control

978
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
HR 645

979
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
Some podcast

980
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Meridian wasn't

981
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,487
Local government

982
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,351
And as we will know

983
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
They're ready

984
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,911
For the riots

985
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
What day is the 10th

986
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,263
Can centers that are being open up around the country

987
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:09,663
Which state is so bad right now

988
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
And food riots

989
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
They know what's going on

990
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
And they're prepared for

991
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Pause this right now

992
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,879

00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
Documentaries

997
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
Gerald Celente

998
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
Look so much

999
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,959
Like a ballet instructor out of time

1000
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:39,359
They're going to be honestly also looks more tired

1001
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,479
Yeah

1002
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015

Can you do it he is out

1004
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Point insane

1005
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,951
Could not be happier with

1006
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,631
Art and Tails over his ears like he's balding on top

1007
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,495
You've got the scope

1008
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Yeah

1009
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:13,919
This man this man has put on the greatest

1010
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
That New York City has ever seen

1011
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Off Broadway

1012
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,183

Stuff like this

1014
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,791
I think he's aged out of the Roll by this point but right there

1015
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,375
He could play Tanta mellow theatrical.

1016
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,847
If I can't be with the coaches

1017
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
It's all there

1018
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
We're going to have something

1019
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759

1020
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,855
Prepare for it themselves

1021
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Anyone that's not

00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
Prepared for what's going to happen

1023
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
They deserve what they get

1024
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
Because that's not nice

1025
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887

Hey

1033
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
If you believe that there should be

1034
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
Gun control

1035
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
We don't want you to buy us

1036
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:33,279
President emergency

00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,655
We want everyone to be able to prepare but if you're into liberal politics

1038
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Don't buy our food

1039
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471

I get it but

1045
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
Why you putting that out in the world that's

1046
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,087
Meaning for

1047
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,415
Go fuc yourself

1048
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,487
The world gold

1049
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:09,375
And probably gun Obama ordered the defense department to issue.

1050
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
Fortino 4.10

1051
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,495
Establishing a 1 million person civilian Army

1052
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
It didn't do that much control

1053
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,383
It didn't do that I'm moulting asleep Obama want

1054
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
That wasn't part of it that's not part of the temp

1055
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,575
Silgan put a next time to make sure those two other exes are many actors three accidents so far

1056
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Notice for

1057
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,695
Right was it three were before it no no no this is still Point number two

1058
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
This is

1059
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,447
McDonald's website

1060
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Is a recruiting tool

1061
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Building a separate

1062
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
Completely private Army

1063
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
Outside of government Obama Barack Obama has

1064
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
Presidential decision directive 51

1065
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
Shine by George W bush

1066
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,183
Obama has refused to get rid of

1067
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,487
Presidential decision directive 81

1068
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,303
He's about to save it it makes

1069
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,863
The president of dictator.

1070
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Respond in the event

1071
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
Did a catastrophic disaster

1072
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,895
Right I'm really if you want to look at it

1073
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
It hasn't really been enacted at all

1074
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Since that it was an accident

1075
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,807
2007

1076
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,367
Like it has been put into place

1077
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,183
Was the original Act was which

1078
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Is presidential

1079
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
67

1080
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,535
Which Clinton enacted in 1998

1081
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
It only was ever enacted l911

1082
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,191
Because that was a catastrophic disaster

1083
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:53,055
A bit of an outlier but we have a history since 1998 of Presidential Directive

1084
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
67

1085
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
And PD d51 after

1086
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
After that

1087
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
It's a whole history since 1990

1088
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,295
It's been an accident wants no one's ever abused it

1089
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,343
I don't know I don't care

1090
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,879

I don't know if anybody remember

1093
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Because I haven't seen

1094
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,607

Most

1097
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
Evil collection of human beings

1098
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
In one room

1099
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Rubbish

1100
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
You're running

1103
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,223
Rumsfeld is like the Avatar of

00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Murder

1105
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,807
Is a murder Bender

1106
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:41,695
He just like is almost like he has no feelings like

1107
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,095
He doesn't even take pleasure in the destruction that he

1108
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:52,191
Come inside while he's being evil

1109
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,031
Empty on the inside like this is the most evil

1110
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Collection of people

1111
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
And then George W

1112
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,687
Dumb bastard

1113
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,295
Tough memories

They should all go to the

1117
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,767
They should also

1118
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
President is a dick

1119
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Congress

Don't say that

1122
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,823
Security objectives

1123
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
Alex playlist

Strong Justice well-funded

1127

They love it

1128
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,767
President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel

1129
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Repeatedly stated on the rec

1130
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,375
All Americans below the age of 64

1131
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
Will be forcibly

1132
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
That's crazy

1133
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Citizenship is

1134
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
It's not an entitled

1135
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
It comes with

1136
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Responsibility

1137
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,663
Everybody somewhere between the ages 18-25 will serve three months of faith

1138
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Training and understanding

1139
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Any kind of civil

1140
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,551
So it doesn't always have to be

1141
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,391
Service in uniform one of the things that if you talk to our general

1142
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
They are desperate for

1143
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,743
Is a civilian

1144
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Counterpart

1145
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
To our military forces

1146
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Alex

1147
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,727
Is what he's doing is he's cutting between interviews where people are talking about different things

1148
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,287
Is doing this interview about his book on C-Span

1149
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
2006

1150
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,127
About this idea that he has about like

1151
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Creating

1152
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Got civilian

1153
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
Not armies but

1154
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
People who are able to

1155
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
Responded moment's notice

1156
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,343
That sort of idea

1157
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
Which never got anywhere

1158
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,951
And then Obama talking about the Peace Corps

1159
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,767
He's cutting in between those two things as if they're the same

1160
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
Same thing

1161
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Not

1162
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,351
This compulsory then

1163
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Goodwill

1164
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
You have to innocence

1165
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
A required of them

1166
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
25 Tremont

1167
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
And it's some point of that

1168
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Point YouTube

1169
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:11,199
Also Alex said 18 to 64 I don't know where you got that

1170
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,247
Is the only person is giving age numbers

1171
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
Using 18 to 25

1172
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
So I don't know where 60

1173
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Before is coming

1174
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
And also

1175
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Is like like when you

1176
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
You turn 64 or when you

1177
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
65

1178
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
I think if you're 6

1179
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
Before 3

1180
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
60 days

1181
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:30,399
You're in baby don't think that's fair

1182
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,215
Before we three weeks who gives a s***

1183
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,127
Ultrasound

1184
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,759
The Personnel my God no

1185
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,319
Is imposing the building accurate now

1186
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
And finance

1187
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Change.gov

1188
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
Proclaim

1189
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
The Middle School in High

1190
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
School students will be forced

1191
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
To serve the Federal

1192
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,959
So here I actually think that this is the best

1193
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
Evidence

1194
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
B Alex Jones

1195
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Is a complete

1196
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
F******

1197
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Liar

1198
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,127
Because I passed this year on screen

1199
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
And what it says America serve

1200
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
Here right America serve

1201
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
And what this sentence says

1202
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,623
Is Obama call on citizens of all ages to serve America by developer

1203
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
A plan to require 50 hours of

1204
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Community service

1205
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,791
In middle school and high school in 100 hours of community service at

1206
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
The college ever

1207
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,631
Now I went back to the way back

1208
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Is that website actually said

1209
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
Know when Alex

1210
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
Can't say with certainty who did it

1211
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Put someone.

1212
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
This is photo

1213
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,927
No s*** hundred percent no s***

1214
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
Through the entire. When

1215
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
Obama was running

1216
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,095
When Alex could have been making this documentary

1217
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
Up to the date of the documentary came out

1218
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
And it didn't say that on the website

1219
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:15,103
I'll read you the quote that it does say on the website call on citizens of all

1220
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Disturb

1221
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,783
Don't set a goal that all middle-aged middle school and high school students engaged

1222
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Health Plan

1223
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
For all high school students who engage in 100 hours of

1224
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
Community service

1225
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:31,487
To receive a fully refundable tax credit of $4,000 for their education

1226
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,791
So the idea of that

1227
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,583
Removed all of the

1228
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,191
Holyshit this is entirely doctor

1229
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,799
No not now whether Alex took it from and disreputable source and thought it was

1230
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:51,199
Right or something like that

1231
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,015
There is literally no way that this page

1232
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,831
Existed on Obama's website

1233
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,159
During the time when Alex

1234
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Cool as f***

1235
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Nicely done

1236
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,607
It's so weird it's so weird to go to bed

1237
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,167
The only the only

1238
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,215
Only thing that's really something

1239
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Individual change

1240
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Is

1241
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
I mean some of the language

1242
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
But

1243
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Choir choir

1244
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:25,759
The require part and once and there's no part of $4,000

1245
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,319
Yes they did

1246
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,879
Play in the whole thrust of it is that Obama and Biden

1247
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
Yeah it's

1248
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,719
We would like you to do this

1249
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
Tonight we're going to tell you

1250
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,559
Do it but also if you look here

1251
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Like Obama will call you use the same language

1252
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,287
Yeah you saying call on you to do it but it still says require

1253
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
That's worth

1254
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,103
That is absolutely

1255
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
Fraud no matter what

1256
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
Yep that's not real

1257
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,527
Alright anyway

1258
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,063
Forgot

1259
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,463
Because you can say this and bab like I just got that screenshot projector sobik

1260
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:13,119
Whoever

1261
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
The case is closed

1262
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,495
Instant like yes

1263
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
Is fraud

1264
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Someone

1265
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Doctor this

1266
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
Wasn't Obama's website

1267
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
At all

1268
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Holyshit

1269
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Fascism

1270
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
Gutter up

1271
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
It's up

1272
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Hooligan

1273
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Starbucks

1274
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
Fervently idealist

1275
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
Around Obama

1276
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,023
Where you get a puppy

1277
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
Call man

1278
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
To do that so I think that's

1279
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
That's

1280
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
If you were left

1281
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Liberal

1282
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,151
To that

1283
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,943
Into a paramilitary domestic

1284
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
Did security

1285
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
Why do you say 18

1286
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:06,879
24 this time that doesn't even match with Ron's 1825 and Alex's 5:42

1287
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,903
Before from earlier

1288
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
Is AJ's make no sense

1289
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,487
Give Obama has his way

1290
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Adult and Senior

1291
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,839
Will also be fixed other forms of survey

1292
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,167
What are they busy

1293
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Number three

1294
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
Text

1295
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
That was in the second

1296
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
As We Know

1297
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
There we go

1298
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
Build

1299
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,831
Holy

1300
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:42,463
The first time

1301
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
The Obamas going to take

1302
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:51,423
I guess most important thing of the past eight years of Obama's presidency

1303
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,823
Eliza

1304
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Yeah part of the gun thing and now save Mission failed

1305
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Robespierre

1306
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
All 5

1307
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,903
The most deadly mass shootings have happened since this documentary was made

1308
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Has happened

1309
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,719
Has been done to curb the excesses

1310
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,095
In 2018 alone there been over 300 mass shootings and no one gives us s***

1311
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,887
What is a

1312
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
No one

1313
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
Really seems to

1314
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
There's nothing happening

1315
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
All the pretty it's more like

1316
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Ground into a

1317
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,127
Human beings

1318
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
Empathy

1319
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,455
Will you still live

1320
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
We've been ground into a paste

1321
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
By the NRA

1322
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Trumpet

1323
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
Cinepolis Vista

1324
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,159
And Alex doing everything possible to

1325
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Brabus of Hope

1326
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:50,303
Or ability

1327
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Guidance

1328
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,191
HR 1022 would allow the new Attorney General Eric Holder

1329
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,727
The dictatorial power

1330
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
Any gun he wish

1331
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
At will

1332
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
No it wouldn't

1333
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
HR

1334
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:06,687
10/22 did nothing except reinstate the assault weapons ban

1335
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,735
I'm passing 1994

1336
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
It didn't pass

1337
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
In 2008

1338
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
Before The Supreme Court

1339
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,415
In the DC gun ban case

1340
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
District of Columbia versus Heller

1341
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,559
Boulder argued for the complete disarmament of the American people

1342
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
No he didn't

1343
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
He had nothing to do with DC vs. Heller

1344
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,215
She wasn't the Attorney General at the time

1345
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,007
He wasn't involved in the case

1346
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,335
K-Swiss sign Amicus brief

1347
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,639
Which supported the idea that

1348
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,943
The Second Amendment doesn't necessarily

1349
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,783
Provides a right for all citizens to own whatever guns

1350
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,319
Alex is f****** lying

1351
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
Eric Holden argue before The Supreme Court

1352
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,815
HR 257 would ban all youth shooting

1353
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,887
Including YMCA and Youth Olympic Shooting

1354
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,983
HR 257

1355
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,103
Supportive schools having guns

1356
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,919
From the restrictions on minors have begun

1357
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
It would be very easy to see how well-run gun club like

1358
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,855
This 4-H club it Alex

1359
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
Program

1360
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
This is all bulshit

1361
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,767
Hr45 would force all gun owners

1362
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,119
The undergo Federal psychological screen

1363
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
Play

1364
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:37,055
Hr40

1365
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:42,943
But it was really actually more about the idea that you needed proper licenses to buy cont

1366
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,087
Ironically though in his 2018 interview with Patrick bet-david that we went over when I was f****** drunk at that hotel

1367
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,767
He doesn't want crazy

1368
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
You haven't given up on that

1369
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,655
I don't know

1370
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:09,055
Is X4 that I think he's put Adeline under that extra something just because it's like

1371
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,991
And there are seven

1372
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,807
This isn't good

1373
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:24,671
White house chief North

1374
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,487
Any American on the fraudulent no-fly list

1375
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,023
From owning any fire

1376
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
If you are on the no-fly list

1377
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
Because you are known

1378
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
As maybe a possum

1379
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
Paris

1380
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
You cannot

1381
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Bye

1382
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
A handgun

1383
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
In America

1384
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,407
Over 25,000 Americans are added each month

1385
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:48,735
To the no-fly little higher than a million people

1386
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
Charger convicted

1387
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
Of any crime

1388
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,159
I think that Alex's is a spare on this based on the time

1389
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,439
He's making this

1390
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,839
But everyone

1391
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
Absurd

1392
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,703
Is the no-fly list

1393
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,495
Practical

1394
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:16,639
Alex is exaggerating about it a little bit but I think spiritually is kind of right

1395
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
I'll give the tip of a cat on that cap on

1396
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
5 year old boy from Normandy Park

1397
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
He had trouble boarding a plane because

1398
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,463
Someone with the same name

1399
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Mimi

1400
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
They love local news

1401
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,191
I love local news so much story

1402
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,775
Nothing so good I love local news

1403
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
Nothing

1404
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
It's so dumb

1405
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,639
I want more people on the scene

1406
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Everywhere

1407
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
I like the coat

1408
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,503
That she's wearing

1409
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:03,231
Local news

1410
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
Have to play this news classifieds drive that

1411
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
If you

1412
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,359
Instead of having to edit

1413
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,175
Applause before behind him we'd all be like

1414
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,367
Baby baby we wouldn't be hyper

1415
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:47,007
So many of them in prisons right now cuz my two-year-old go

1416
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:52,383
Nevermind

1417
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,015
Sweet Matthew was considered equivalent

1418
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,295
The right to bear arms

1419
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
No right for you

1420
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
And even though this

1421
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
Matthew Gardner was only in kindergarten

1422
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:16,703
TSA worker still conducted a full-blown search

1423
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
Like a government

1424
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,503
Who was more than Antonio

1425
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,343
Search memes make sure that

1426
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,695
I had not obtained any materials from him

1427
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
Massive restrictions on the

1428
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,559
Preemptively rated XM

1429
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
Congress and the FCC

1430
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Have announced plans

1431
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
To not only curtail speech on Talk Radio in newspaper

1432
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
But you also regulates

1433
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
Speech on the internet

1434
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,335
To the orwellian named fairness.

1435
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,943
Oh man I've actually break down two x's on top of

1436
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,551
Each other accident

1437
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,879
The furnace Doctor Who

1438
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
T49 related to political Tea

1439
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
TV and radio

1440
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:14,047
I need to provide balanced coverage equal time for different political ideology

1441
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
Clear-eyed

1442
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,591
Young hearted back then there's also abolished in 1987

1443
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Equal

1444
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
Tunity for each

1445
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
Beachside

1446
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Balance

1447
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,527
Beautiful Sherwin-Williams

1448
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,671
Sylvia what was abolished in 1987 has never been brought back nor will

1449
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,975
Obama didn't bring it back not even

1450
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
The slightest go watch

1451
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
Any goddamn

1452
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,303
Political show annual fee

1453
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,863
Come on you remember how Fox News

1454
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Who is devoted to providing

1455
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,983
Fair and balanced coverage

1456
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,567
But yeah I know

1457
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,919
The Obama machine is also pressuring Congress

1458
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
The pastor Cody and hate speech laws

1459
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
The first

1460
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Number 5

1461
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,879
They plan to further federalized

1462
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
Government

1463
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,975
Can dictate what kind of care citizens receive

1464
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,327
That's a good

1465
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,887
So here's the fun

1466
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
Is that

1467
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,471
He is presenting that as like a negative thing

1468
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
But actually

1469
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Yeah

1470
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
The government

1471
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Should be able to do

1472
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,359
Dictate that

1473
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,919
As opposed to write

1474
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
Who when they dictate that

1475
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,759
Means they don't pay for any

1476
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:42,367
We'll get back to number five in second I'm not done with number for Alex jumped really quickly

1477
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:48,767
Are you there it's really just paranoia among people who just want to use a bunch of

1478
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:55,935
They're worried about that their rights a offensive taken away

1479
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:02,335
Never been an issue like it's not like

1480
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:08,735
Free speech

1481
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
You're certainly allowed

1482
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,879
I mean the consequences of your actions will be brought upon you you know whatever that may be

1483
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
MP3 or go for it

1484
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
Other people

1485
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,071
Edward anymore

1486
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,631
Use people put also

1487
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:31,263
Same rules apply is to the Madea situation if you're the only person there watching the ice dancer you probably

1488
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
People performing probably too

1489
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,847
Too busy performing

1490
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,223
I don't know actually I've been ice dancers would probably

1491
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Stopped everything to be like

1492
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,367
We're done

1493
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:52,255
Look none of that stuff is ever really been the issue but what has is been expanding what care

1494
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,791
Characteristics qualified

1495
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,815
For consideration

1496
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Germany

1497
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
Previously

1498
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
To the time that we're talking to

1499
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
About if you were to be

1500
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
Beat up someone who is

1501
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
Trans

1502
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
Cuz they were trans

1503
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
It wasn't hate

1504
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
But with the expanded legal definitions for

1505
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
222

1506
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
It could

1507
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
I hate crime

1508
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
That's worth

1509
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
You'd be totally free to stay

1510
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
Whatever bulshit you want

1511
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
You can say whatever you want

1512
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,671
You could say that trans people aren't human

1513
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
If you want for it

1514
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Free speech

1515
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,815
Tell me whatever other people respond to that fit

1516
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
The open

1517
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Respond

1518
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
But like

1519
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,775
That is what Alex is talking about what he's talking about Draconian hate speech

1520
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,591
Laws that are going to eviscerate the First Amendment

1521
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
If this thing started it like

1522
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,943
Protected classes of people that weren't

1523
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
4

1524
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:54,207
13 1/2 million hours

1525
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,999
Like you said I great

1526
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:02,911
Now a huge concern about this paranoia about rationing Healthcare

1527
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
And restricting

1528
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Procedures

1529
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
That's why you

1530
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
He's afraid about

1531
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,543
This idea of federalized healthcare

1532
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
But even if we imagine

1533
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,871
This is just

1534
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
I was just paranoid he's Express

1535
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
The insurance industry previously did a whole hell

1536
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:23,647
Restricting procedures Terry word Grace primary

1537
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
So they couldn't

1538
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,743
Trey really restrict access to healthcare based on pre-existing

1539
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
Condition which was something that made

1540
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,863
Millions of Americans unable to access for Apria Healthcare

1541
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:39,263
Without going absolutely can't remember a time whenever

1542
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Companies

1543
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:51,295
Don't you think

1544
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Is operating

1545
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
Replaces not really

1546
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,879
Giving a f*** about people

1547
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
But in terms of this

1548
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,767
So the first four I would say Mission not accomplished

1549
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,863
This one mission

1550
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,519
But I guess

1551
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
I guess

1552
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Medium

1553
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
Looks good for a bit and then no

1554
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
Modeled after the British

1555
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
System

1556
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
This includes a rationing care

1557
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,551
And restricting what procedure

1558
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
Handicap

1559
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Elderly

1560
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
Eligible

1561
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,535
Number 6 Obama is already pushing

1562
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,839
To expand the Department of Defense budget

1563
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,655
And the station more US troops overseas

1564
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,191
Doing Circle Russia

1565
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
China

1566
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
Iran

1567
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
And alphabetically

1568
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
Ireland would be no

1569
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Ireland

1570
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,711
Northern Ireland who has a lot of fat on this program

1571
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Certain

1572
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Obama didn't do any of these

1573
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,831
It's certainly not at

1574
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
The time

1575
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
This documentary

1576
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Was mad

1577
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
So

1578
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
I would say this is also

1579
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
Mission failed globalist

1580
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Port Bass

1581
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,863
When will you ever catch a break

1582
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,423
Under the pretext of humanitarian Aid

1583
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,495
And dominate an occupy Africa

1584
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Peru Africa

1585
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
You have

1586
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
Bob Chapman on

1587
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
Your show all the f******

1588
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Anytime

01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
Who was a profiteer from apartheid South Africa

1590
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,463
Modern world Africa you have no right to make any

1591
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,375
Take Africa down what an a******

1592
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
Your phone calls

1593
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,055
Barack H Obama

1594
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,591
Frontman

1595
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,383
Let's go to Anthony in Georgia

1596
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,431
Anthony what's your take on Barack Obama

1597
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
Does this seem like a setup to you cuz it is a herd

1598
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,159
When we were going over 2000

1599
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,207
The first time Anthony called in

1600
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:10,303
It was right at the end of an episode about to go

1601
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,607
And this guy called in and Alex is like

1602
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
Oh my God

1603
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:18,239
You're a guy who's really against Obama call in tomorrow

1604
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,799
I need to record you for the Obama Deception

1605
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
This

1606
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,615
Is the end result of that

1607
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
They put the

1608
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,175
The faith of Barack Obama

1609
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
As part of

1610
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
There their public relations

1611
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,831
Because it's like the old folktales about vampires

1612
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
Vampire

1613
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,207
His way into somebody

1614
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,559
So the vampire hats called

1615
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,655
Does this guy literally believe in vampires

1616
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
Vampires are real

1617
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:57,151
But the rules rescue

1618
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
The household

1619
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,991
Open the door in

1620
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
Invite him in

1621
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,831
The people at Barack Obama

1622
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
Looks like then

1623
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
And appears to be

1624
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Be on their side

1625
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,695
Wednesday okay here's my Ally

1626
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
Earlier

1627
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
And then Barack Obama

1628
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,095
The frontman for

1629
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
The American Inn

1630
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Empire where he's going to have

1631
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,935
The entire US Navy

1632
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
The entire US Army and entire us

1633
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Marine

1634
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Under African command

1635
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
And of course

1636
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,615
You going to turn it into a new Iraq and it

1637
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,687
And everything else

1638
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Is going

1639
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
Propagate

1640
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
Poor countries of Africa

1641
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,903
Sure I agree with you

1642
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,255
Handsome smiling African face

1643
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:50,399
Boy

1644
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Shout out

1645
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,471
American cheese

1646
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
To Shell out there people

1647
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Trick in the book

1648
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:03,711
Isn't that good we can also pacify the most downtrodden minority groups in the United States

1649
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
Sacrifice

1650
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Alex

1651
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,999
How about you go f*** yourself when you're talking about style out Native American Chief well in this same

1652
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
Andrew Jackson

1653
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
You mother f*****

1654
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,655
How dare you have those two ideas at the same time

1655
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
Kind of

1656
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Jordan

1657
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
I would say

1658
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
It literally

1659
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
That just

1660
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
2 position

1661
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
Native American Chiefs

1662
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
And I love Andrew Jackson

1663
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,223
Is all you need to know about an Alex Jones

1664
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,271
That dichotomy is

1665
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,343
That sums him up perfectly you know it's like

1666
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
You're so unfair

1667
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
It's like

1668
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,255
Finishing a different

1669
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
See you then

1670
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Starting one

1671
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
Oh wait

1672
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,911
No Andrew Jackson was a f***

1673
01:16:55,935 --> 01:17:02,079
I forgot about a getaway 2

1674
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
Kick them out of Zimbabwe with a get-well materials

1675
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,295
Start a Civil War in Congo

1676
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Another big source of raw materials

1677
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,183
An arm of the DSW

1678
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,535
Why not

1679
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,375
I don't understand what this a documentary steals about China

1680
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,423
It's very confusing to me

1681
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,751
Like what exactly

1682
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,847
Earlier

1683
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,639
Together in this new world order

1684
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
I don't fucken

1685
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,087
I can't make heads or tails of the geopolitical

1686
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,415
Webster Police version of geopolitics

1687
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,463
Is different than Alex's

1688
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,999
Soap with the two of them

1689
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,815
Existing at the same time in this documentary

1690
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,607
It's f****** confusing

1691
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,887
And they do know

1692
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,983
To try and make the two work together

1693
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
I think I've lost my

1694
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:08,639
Yeah I know literally lost

1695
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,479
You're more confident than me

1696
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,759
Around odinga

1697
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
That's Obama's cousin

1698
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,087
It is not

1699
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
Children

1700
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,183
Oh my God

1701
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
You don't know any

1702
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,863
Odinga is not

1703
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,191
Doesn't he said he was just trying to get him

1704
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:36,031
More elevation in

1705
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:40,639
He says his two kids he has

1706
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,431
Obama

1707
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,575
But if he were they wouldn't be his niece and nephew be second

1708
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,391
Cousin

1709
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
I don't

1710
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
What

1711
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,719
How any of these

1712
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
People are allowed to

1713
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Continue talking

1714
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Yeah.

1715
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:04,959
They should really stop

1716
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
And political asset Hellyeah

1717
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
South Africa

1718
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
So this

1719
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,079
Odinga

1720
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:17,247
Destabilizing operation in Kenya

1721
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
The crush the Christians in

1722
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,439
You're not he's arguing that there's a

1723
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,863
He's not he's not a Muslim

1724
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
I know it doesn't matter put like

1725
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,495
He's trying to paint him as if he is he's not

1726
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:45,919
Salsarita's in one of the greatest stories of our time

1727
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,455
In that beat

1728
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,831
Is a battlefield in Flames between the US and the Chinese

1729
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
As if it wasn't

1730
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Before

1731
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:58,463
Over the last couple hundred years if it wasn't

1732
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Just a

1733
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,887
Playground for colonialist interest

1734
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Scenario

1735
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
They could begin I'm not sure there is

1736
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,336
I don't know everything's on fire everything's on fire

1737
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
Give everybody with

1738
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,176
Eritrea

1739
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,248
I guess but the idea of like

1740
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
He's putting

1741
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Out here

1742
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
Doesn't reflect reality

1743
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
This is

1744
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,720
This is one of these times

1745
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
That like I looked into it

1746
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
Kind understand it

1747
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
But then I was also like

1748
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,144
F*** off

1749
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
I spent too much time

1750
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,752
Like digging into the specifics

1751
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,800
I don't care about your analysis Tarpley

1752
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,104
This isn't

1753
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
The Chinese out

1754
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,664
For geopolitical

1755
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Number 7

1756
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:57,600
Radically expand Federal control over family farms and ranches system

1757
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,464
Odinga

1758
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,864
Since near the world

1759
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,568
Family Farm

1760
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,408
Mission

1761
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:26,272
Alright alright another

1762
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:32,672
Holyshit we're already on the number eight so I got to talk about it.

1763
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:36,768
Talk about the animal ID system

1764
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,096
The end to things that the globalist

1765
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,912
Going to put into place in order to make it so that Farms can't exist

1766
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,752
Proposal

1767
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,544
Voluntary system

1768
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
Right

1769
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,872
But it's actually even worse for Alex's argument

1770
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,712
Then that according to the National agricultural Law Center

1771
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,296
Well the nais program was voluntary

1772
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,320
On the federal level

1773
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,904
Some states portions of it on the state level

1774
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,696
This was just a system

1775
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
It was proposed in order

1776
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Track animals

1777
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
So if there's an outbreak

1778
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:14,400
Like mad cow it becomes easier to contain

1779
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
On the federal level

1780
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
Buttercup Estates

1781
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,984
States rights

1782
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,056
Decided to pass on the state level

1783
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,872
No Alex shouldn't give a s*** about that

1784
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
They chose to

1785
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Do that it's the states

1786
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
F*** you Alex

1787
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,528
Let's states with Catalan Mex

1788
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,088
Brickell under the security and prosperity Park

1789
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:40,256
DVD copy of The Obama Deception

1790
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:46,144
U.s. Mexico

1791
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
He is also a

1792
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,008
A remaining Federal Authority

1793
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Tunnel

1794
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
Quasi-governmental body

1795
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
Nope

1796
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
Number nine

1797
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
Obama where are you

1798
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
The president

1799
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
Of the United States

1800
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:09,952
Find Andy's coming

1801
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
2 plan

1802
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Because in 48 years

1803
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
Obama must take the blame

1804
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,328
As bushed

1805
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,864
For the New World Order

1806
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
Agenda

1807
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,192
At that point the illegal for the Newport

1808
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Ceremonial seat of power

1809
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,224
Hahaha

1810
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:45,024
Hilarious

1811
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,608
That's so funny is reduction

1812
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,168
Ain't here for eight years and now they're going to have

1813
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,960
How to build up somebody else's a savior

1814
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
Alex

1815
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
You did

1816
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,640
I want to live back in the past years from when this documentary came out

1817
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,504
You built up a fall savior your dumbass hole

1818
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,320
It also has failed on that one

1819
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,184
I think forever

1820
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
Yeah proper

1821
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,768
Alex is such a dumb rube

1822
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,584
I think I'm still exist

1823
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,912
I'm not sure

1824
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,752
Texasdirectauto

1825
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
A f******

1826
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,848
And much less on the end

1827
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,384
Mirrors

1828
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,712
My approach to this documentary

1829
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,040
I'm sick of this I think he got through like three

1830
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:45,440
America

1831
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Let's go

1832
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,280
I like I like a round number let's get to 10

1833
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,608
So the process is repeated

1834
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Over

1835
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
Withdrawal

1836
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
For their program to work

1837
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
It is essential

1838
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
Look up people not learn

1839
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,848
The presidency is now nothing more than theater

1840
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
Because if they did

1841
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,688
People would stop looking at the pond

1842
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,272
Or the queen

1843
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
We can move better to see

1844
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:18,208
Any of that

1845
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,328
Who's the rug shop

1846
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,400
Investigating the globalist

1847
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
Bishop is Greenspan

1848
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
Number 10

1849
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,520
Job to sell the pub

1850
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Policies

1851
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,104
The dark in the People's Best in

1852
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,640
But the overlord

1853
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:38,944
X

1854
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,736
His most

1855
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:47,136
I tried to figure out if

1856
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:52,000
Describe all these points

1857
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
Merge Canada us and Mexico

1858
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,584
That's a good sensation

1859
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:01,472
Number 10 I tried to figure out is a shout out to our friends over at Marty and Sarah love wrestling

1860
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,288
Number 10 is protect

1861
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
The business

1862
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,592
I don't f****** know like

1863
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,920
You don't hear what he says I think it's just like

1864
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
Okay alright

1865
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,504
Important function

1866
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,808
To protect the criminal oligarch

1867
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,088
Prosecution

1868
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
Economy worldwide

1869
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
Start new Wars

1870
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
And engaging

1871
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,144
Barack Obama's wife

1872
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:35,264
Also in that role is to make sure that no one

1873
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
Finds out

1874
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
The Powerball

1875
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
Behind the

1876
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
The government is

1877
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,616
Stuff like that

1878
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,896
I have no idea what he's

1879
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,176
F****** means by that cuz I

1880
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
Who's Obama

1881
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,992
Protecting is it David Rockefeller

1882
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:49,856
Because people like weirdos isn't complaining about him for a lot longer than Obama's been around

1883
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,136
Is it the CFR

1884
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,976
Because conspiracies about them like Phyllis Schlafly his early work

1885
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
I don't understand what secret Obama supposed to be protecting

1886
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Except

1887
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,120
If the case is

1888
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,656
It's a secret that Alex

1889
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,192
Also hasn't review

1890
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,520
And we don't know what that is

1891
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
Which would imply that

1892
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
Who is protect

1893
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,920
That secret to reveal at

1894
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
No no

1895
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
Suggesting is number 10

1896
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
His whole idea about Obama is supposed to make sure the

1897
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
This people don't eat

1898
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,648
Who is behind the throne

1899
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,744
I know who Alex has said is a good names that he's thrown out there

1900
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,144
And those are Revelations it's nothing new or anything like that

1901
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:38,496
He's not telling us either

1902
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,800
Alex is

1903
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,872
And you

1904
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
If Alex is right

1905
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Then Alex

1906
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
He's come

1907
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:52,576
By his own account

1908
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,904
He is as guilty as all these people

1909
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
I'll protect

1910
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,232
Ironic

1911
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,048
Choose one side or the other Alex you dumb dumb

1912
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:08,192
Champagne Barack Obama use the internet like no other

1913
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:14,592
Canada before

1914
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,872
Eager energetic Army

1915
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Caleb

1916
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:23,296
Barack Obama and his administration contact information for so many people so next time

1917
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:29,696
He can contact all these people

1918
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,256
Kennedy was selected

1919
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,192
It was the scope of Obama's victory that was most impressed

1920
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,312
I saw

1921
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Obama

1922
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Playing bass

1923
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,432
I said you know what

1924
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
And that's the world

1925
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,600
I want a piece of History

1926
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,672
Commemorating the day the world changed forever

1927
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,952
Is confidence

1928
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,488
BioLife

1929
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
Are an inspiration to us all

1930
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:10,400
On the idea commemorative plates here

1931
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Saint Idaho

1932
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,984
Want to hear about the Donald Trump

1933
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
Commemorative

1934
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
I'll leave that part out

1935
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,104
Barred owl

1936
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:24,480
I've seen more than enough party cry

1937
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
Donald Trump commemorative

1938
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,064
Coin is

1939
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
Gauche

1940
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
To the point where you're like

1941
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:37,280
There's no way that you could be a parody of yourself Beyond

1942
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:41,120
The level that you already are I will look at it

1943
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,656
Holyshit

1944
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:49,056
You're an amalgam of all the cartoon evil there's ever been abroad

1945
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,920
Fox the bad guy from Captain Planet

1946
01:29:54,176 --> 01:30:00,320
The part in my script or I talked about how he made a commemorative coin about him meeting with Kim Jeong Hoon

1947
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
I'm going to kill you anyway before the summit workout

1948
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
I don't mean to threaten violence

1949
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:16,448
Recently

1950
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:23,872
In 2011 the Atlantic did a deep dive into the world of Ron Paul memorabilia

1951
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,664
Pretty wild stuff

1952
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
Or

1953
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,856
Referred you could treat yourself to a wooden

1954
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,392
Plate with Ron

1955
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:39,744
Commemorating his 2008 run for president for 60 bucks

1956
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,816
They found copper coins with Ron Paul's face on it

1957
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
Or talk with the iconic World words

1958
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,680
Gold standard in leadership

1959
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,008
On it which is ironic

1960
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,640
I'm not sure for the hide

1961
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:59,968
Okay

1962
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,528
But so is a wooden plate

1963
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:08,160
A bird

1964
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:12,000
I saw it looks like something that you might do

1965
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
Soldering iron

1966
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Interesting

1967
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,168
2007

1968
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,728
Before this documentary came out yet

1969
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,520
According to CBS News.

1970
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:29,152
Federal agents raided the headquarters of a group that produces a legal truancy

1971
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,712
Season gold silver into tons

1972
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:35,552
Copper coins featuring Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul on it

1973
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,672
What are the targets of the real guy named Bernard Vaughn

1974
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:48,096
And that's not even a capital

1975
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:54,496
Hausel even if that is your name

1976
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,800
Bernard

1977
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:03,712
Founder of the National Organization for the repeal of the Federal Reserve

1978
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,576
He said quote I'm volunteering to meet with agents and get arrested so we can

1979
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,368
Can thresh this afternoon

1980
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
The

1981
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,744
Quick to say I had nothing to do with that s***

1982
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,536
Found out house was

1983
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
Do 6 months

1984
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,520
Dumb weirdo

1985
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Literals

1986
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,176
He was sent to the Von nuthouse

1987
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,736
Yes

1988
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Information

1989
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:43,904
Las Palmas

1990
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,440
Crazed Obama worship

1991
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,744
Being pushed by the corporate media

1992
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,816
Scientifically designed to capture the public

1993
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:55,936
Internet air pressure Mass euphoria

1994
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,960
New World Order

1995
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,752
Can just distract the pub

1996
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
For a few more years

1997
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:10,272
None of this is real

1998
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,320
A professor

1999
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
Wheatfields

2000
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
What do you call a

2001
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
What's thing will you get

2002
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,232
Black man

2003
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,280
Everything's going to be alright

2004
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,376
I think the Germans

2005
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,912
What the Democratic Party

2006
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,936
Has been

2007
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,216
Isabel

2008
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
It will be about Regatta

2009
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
Barack Obama

2010
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
The president

2011
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,664
So I want to say one thing straight up

2012
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
Alex keeps talking about how

2013
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:48,160
Documentary

2014
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,952
Attic party

2015
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:56,352
And it's at the end of the documentary he says in summation and then immediately plays a clip of Professor

2016
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,120
Griff's

2017
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,448
It doesn't matter about Obama it's about what the Democratic

2018
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
Party is doing

2019
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:07,872
It seems like this is very partisan

2020
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,968
Come on

2021
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
ATMs

2022
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:16,832
Deeply partisan with the veneer the misdirect of

2023
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,904
I'm complaining about right

2024
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
Sure

2025
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:26,816
Anyway I'm going to watch a for like in game to start now again

2026
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:33,216
Like I'm worried they're bad news we got 6 hours left another two hours long and it's just

2027
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,264
Going to be endgame on top of

2028
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
If that violin starts

2029
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,616
Kill everyone

2030
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
Barack Obama

2031
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
Perfect Trojan Horse

2032
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:47,296
Do people feel like they finally have a place at the table

2033
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:54,464
They do

2034
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,048
Real quick clip of the lady was like I can pay my mortgage

2035
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,072
Yeah

2036
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,352
If you go and find the

2037
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,400
Beaufort like that

2038
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,960
She saying is now that I don't feel as

2039
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
Worried about the

2040
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
The economy

2041
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:10,592
So I can pay my bills

2042
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:16,992
Pay her mortgage which is

2043
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
I totally

2044
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:22,624
To say something that it's not never seen that

2045
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,184
Okay good day whatever house

2046
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:29,280
Core supporters can't see what's right

2047
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,304
Front of their face

2048
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,632
Because they've already invested their very identity

2049
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,936
In this artificially created

2050
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,960
Cold movement

2051
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,056
Oh hit lerab history

2052
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,664
People turn their intellect

2053
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:52,064
Oh 44 minutes

2054
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Put a visual dog

2055
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:01,792
William William credit we've gone

2056
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,096
Play happening to finally now get to Hitler

2057
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:10,240
I tip my hat to him in terms of like yeah I think you thought they would be like a real

2058
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,824
Kaboom

2059
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
I'm stoked

2060
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,224
Sure that we finally got our first Hitler

2061
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:24,064
And everyone's first Hitler is Big Mama

2062
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
Did he showed the restraint

2063
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
An adult

2064
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:32,256
Grown up

2065
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
And it's happening again

2066
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,240
The evidence presented in this film is documented facts

2067
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,384
Payroll of us all

2068
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
Frightening as the information in this film is

2069
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:57,088
There are many things we can do just really don't know what the information is

2070
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,952
First we expose The Cult of Obama for what it is

2071
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:02,976
A sad hook

2072
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
Okay

2073
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Next

2074
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:08,096
Realize that we are all being propagandized

2075
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
24/7

2076
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,400
Okay

2077
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,472
All information for yourself

2078
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,288
I did the media

2079
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,312
For this film

2080
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
I did enjoy

2081
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:28,576
Be aware of

2082
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,744
You trying to pull out the big guns

2083
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,048
Liberty

2084
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,376
Is it International Wisconsin

2085
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,424
Destroy the sovereignty of all 50

2086
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
States

2087
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:48,032
No he's just trying to say at the end of his like the ReDiscover the Constitution

2088
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,568
Please be a sovereign

2089
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:53,152
Please get to my weird Patriot ideologies

2090
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,456
Zip code for it's not like it doesn't

2091
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,528
Hey Constitution

2092
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
They know

2093
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
It is one of the biggest threats

2094
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,672
Their domination

2095
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:07,488
The federal government has been completely hijack

2096
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
And more than 25 States

2097
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,608
Have recognized this fact

2098
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
And removing the block the New World Order

2099
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,984
At the state level by declaring their 10th Amendment

2100
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:24,896
This is what Alex has been

2101
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,480
Emergency

2102
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,528
Useless grandstanding by dumb

2103
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,600
Schleicher

2104
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,952
The same position

2105
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,256
Nowhere

2106
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,560
But most important of all

2107
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,400
There is a huge Awakening taking place in the United States

2108
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
And across the world

2109
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Against the globalist agenda

2110
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,008
Free people everywhere

2111
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,288
Are joining together

2112
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,104
I'm saying no to corruption and tyranny

2113
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
And no

2114
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,152
The world

2115
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:04,064
The Dismount of this is basically just going to be Alex trying to

2116
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
Convince you

2117
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,136
Unique Jordans

2118
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,464
The peek-a-boo

2119
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,232
Just trying

2120
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,024
Convince people who are listening

2121
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,048
Zearn

2122
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
Neo in The Matrix space

2123
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
And

2124
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
Use clips

2125
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,448
From pretty much all of the people

2126
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,728
Thick we've heard

2127
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
Yes

2128
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:30,688
Download Kung-Fu into my brain in a very short.

2129
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,784
You and I'm sorry about

2130
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:41,184
This is everyone in this room

2131
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,464
Play manipulative like

2132
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
Could it be

2133
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
You are

2134
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
You import

2135
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:15,488
Call Matt

2136
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,768
So historically

2137
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,816
Washington

2138
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,656
What kind of ship General

2139
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
You kind of s*** at the job right

2140
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,216
You look great

2141
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:38,016
6 ft at the time which means he was 10 ft taller than everyone else

2142
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
He looks

2143
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:42,368
Great idea

2144
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
That you're Express

2145
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,256
The best

2146
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,304
Kill the guy

2147
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,120
What's the most boring Legacy

2148
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,008
George Washington

2149
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,360
Except

2150
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,896
And everyone of you watching

2151
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,200
Every single one of

2152
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
Justice

2153
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
Important

2154
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
Get a haircut

2155
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
Who are our founding

2156
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Fathers

2157
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,648
Important

2158
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
17

2159
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
Philosophize

2160
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
About 3

2161
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
Philosophize

2162
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
About a week

2163
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,888
Republic to fly

2164
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,656
Suffice

2165
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
About 8

2166
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,448
Skooly

2167
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
Free

2168
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,360
More than that

2169
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
Wanted to change it

2170
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,064
Baby on fire

2171
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,392
What are you the one

2172
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Nature has a way of

2173
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
A bun

2174
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Looking for

2175
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
What

2176
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
Forthright

2177
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Respect

2178
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,288
Chopper

2179
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,824
Your part

2180
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:14,528
I got bad news

2181
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
Okay

2182
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,320
Two bags one

2183
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,112
Still

2184
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,648
Still on that krs-1 tip

2185
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:22,976
So far

2186
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,304
He is not that anything's egregiously

2187
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,376
He has not said anything that makes

2188
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,408
Pinky's read Ender's Game

2189
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,736
Nothing egregiously bad

2190
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,272
Nothing makes sense

2191
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:51,136
Read Ender's Game I think that if we were able to ever talk to him

2192
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,208
Which I know that will never happen

2193
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:57,024
I think if we did

2194
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,560
I'm not the one

2195
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,840
But it stopped

2196
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
If we were

2197
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,680
If we were able to talk to him I bet

2198
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
He will probably be like

2199
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
I shouldn't have

2200
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
I disagree

2201
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,784
Documentary

2202
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:23,136
Like your taco is cold then you go to Yum brands which is all about

2203
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:29,536
The Federal Reserve and you complain about parents

2204
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:35,680
Owns the Federal Reserve

2205
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:43,104
Evergreen

2206
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:50,016
When it changed its name to VLC player

2207
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:55,904
It is now running the game absolutely

2208
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,744
Everyone knows that there's documentation goofy impression the record I got talking

2209
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,912
I don't know I think

2210
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,728
He would probably not be thrilled with all this

2211
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,288
Especially the way the world is

2212
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,592
Alex

2213
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,640
Exceptional

2214
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,432
Are people who no longer talk to Alex

2215
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:21,760
That I can't have him on the show

2216
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
You get some of this business cleared

2217
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:33,280
Him in essays website

2218
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:38,144
So I can hang with Alex anymore

2219
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,216
I would bet money Victor

2220
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,240
Jesse Ventura

2221
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,032
Wouldn't show up on the show anymore

2222
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:50,688
Willie Nelson was campaigning for Beto yeah Willie Nelson Willie Nelson

2223
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:55,552
Back out maybe was naivete or something like that and they thought that wasn't the person that

2224
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,088
Clearly what I

2225
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:03,744
And they agreed to be a part of this but

2226
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,144
Nope they just don't like most of the people most of these people that you do like

2227
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
If you go do this thing you're like

2228
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,752
Aware of it

2229
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,800
Rob not like a follower

2230
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:22,176
Opportunity for me

2231
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:26,784
Know if I go if I go do a show it's not like I

2232
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,600
Every week

2233
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,440
And watch it and then I'm happy to do it like it's like

2234
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
I go do it

2235
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
You know any

2236
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,584
These guys

2237
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,888
Have the Gestalt

2238
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
Of Alec

2239
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:44,704
I agree that

2240
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,544
He's probably very common but I disagree that that is

2241
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,104
That simple way to operate

2242
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,128
Great Lake

2243
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,920
You know doing stand-up I wouldn't do

2244
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,688
Do shows with

2245
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,224
People who like

2246
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
Thought were

2247
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,272
Talkingshit heads

2248
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,856
Good invite me to do a show

2249
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,880
Do that that's

2250
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Miserly

2251
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
Some have to do

2252
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,256
But if someone like if I were krs-1

2253
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,608
In 2009 he's been around

2254
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,960
Boogie down Productions in like what

2255
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,032
He's been around he knows he knows what

2256
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,568
In terms of like

2257
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,872
What am I going to put my name on

2258
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,408
Right I would expect

2259
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,480
Protect the brand a little bit better had to be like

2260
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,272
Oh Alex seems cool

2261
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Fair

2262
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:36,160
So when you're saying like he hasn't said anything awful I agree with you

2263
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:36,928
Dislike

2264
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:42,560
Somatic

2265
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,352
It's just like

2266
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
You

2267
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
Your

2268
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,448
That's not

2269
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:52,544
Not believe this

2270
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
I got you

2271
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,504
But if you think more of yourself

2272
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,552
Ben just peed in the excess

2273
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,976
Are you everybody's not going to make it

2274
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
Well we don't have to

2275
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,192
To look back thousands of haircut

2276
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:20,960
Persevered

2277
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,240
See how Derek jumper

2278
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,312
We can look back

2279
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:29,408
Active this one's not even haircut looks

2280
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,688
Talkin about the

2281
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
People's Revel

2282
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,248
Talking about the

2283
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
The positive

2284
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
And Lenin came

2285
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Stalin

2286
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
Factor

2287
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:39,904
Is that over

2288
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,672
40

2289
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,696
Million

2290
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,464
Russian

2291
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
25

2292
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:46,816
Good Rush

2293
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,096
People who are Christian

2294
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
People who had

2295
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,656
Who had their own business

2296
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
People who are edgy

2297
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
They were

2298
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Terminated

2299
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
Because

2300
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
They had their own

2301
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Because they were

2302
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,664
They believed is that leave

2303
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,432
God's law

2304
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,224
Is there a war

2305
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
You hold it back

2306
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,672
Now

2307
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,512
Are those the only reasons

2308
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,304
I don't think so

2309
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:21,120
I mean if you wanted it but that there were a lot of

2310
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,400
Butt chugging

2311
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,448
Weird killings on the USSR

2312
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
That s*** was crazy

2313
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,336
Specifically targeting Christians

2314
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
They were anti-religion of all sorts

2315
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Like it wasn't

2316
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,712
This is just

2317
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
We choosing

2318
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:41,600
This part of history of being like we were the victims of the night

2319
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,928
It'll take ticket ticket number as well

2320
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:45,696
Yeah

2321
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,000
We can look over at Germany

2322
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
Germany was in a

2323
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,560
Very very

2324
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,584
Terrible acne

2325
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,608
Economic situation

2326
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:57,472
Very charismatic leader call Jose all Hitler

2327
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
Katie

2328
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,776
Makes the roads

2329
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:03,616
Promises of better life

2330
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:15,392
Dictatorial

2331
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,416
Then we can go to

2332
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:22,560
Tomorrow with you

2333
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:27,680
Borax analogy that is making the most flimsy thing ever it's

2334
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Here is

2335
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,520
Hitler

2336
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,080
Whether or not you made roads great

2337
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:40,480
I'm going to promise you all of these things and then actual real

2338
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,296
F****** genocide

2339
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:49,440
That doesn't mean that anybody who promises you good things

2340
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:54,304
That's the completely that's the stupidest f****** way to look at things ever

2341
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
Furthermore

2342
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,888
Hitler

2343
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,448
Campaigned on like

2344
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,008
Let's not worry about the roads

2345
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,312
Cuz I'm going to commit genocide

2346
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,896
There's some of that

2347
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:13,504
There's a lot of

2348
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:18,880
Pick out a specific

2349
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,648
Group

2350
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,928
And demons

2351
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:25,024
In order to gain power myself

2352
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,560
I'm going to fix the roads

2353
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,584
You know what

2354
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,352
You know what

2355
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:33,472
Gypsies are weird

2356
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,360
Take this

2357
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,408
People and Destroy them

2358
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,456
Because they're at fault for all of our problem

2359
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:46,016
Now is my percent

2360
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:52,416
I believe we can fix our room and repeatedly

2361
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,720
I think that Alex

2362
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:55,744
Think

2363
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,048
Did Obama kept saying kill White

2364
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,960
But if you had venue be like

2365
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
IC

2366
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,288
Yeah

2367
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,336
Nothing

2368
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,384
Have we considered

2369
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,408
So Priscilla

2370
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,688
For so long throughout his

2371
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,272
The majority has chosen a small minority

2372
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,672
Singled them out in and harass them and make their lives miserable

2373
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,440
Kill them

2374
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
In order cement

2375
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
Political power amongst themselves

2376
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Instead

2377
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,656
White people

2378
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,216
Just like single them out

2379
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
And made their lives miserable

2380
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,032
And like kilduff

2381
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:40,800
You

2382
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
Like

2383
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,336
Ton

2384
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,664
Lindsey Graham

2385
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,712
We could lose him

2386
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:48,992
Like that's fine

2387
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:49,760
You know

2388
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,576
But like but like it's not

2389
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,368
It's like not a widespread thing

2390
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:59,488
I'm just saying have we considered genocide on like this

2391
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:08,192
Experiment

2392
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:11,008
That was just to get to the portmanteau

2393
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:14,080
Good outside and I feel like I did my job

2394
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:19,968
I'm going to go retire well I'll stop

2395
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:27,904
This ding dong over here with a bad haircut

2396
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,672
I'm sorry

2397
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,720
Frown decide

2398
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,792
Mal came in

2399
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,072
Promise chain

2400
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
Promise to better life

2401
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,168
In five years

2402
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,056
They don't care a lot

2403
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,080
They don't teach

2404
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,432
They do but they weren't we know what else

2405
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,224
They were exterminated

2406
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:58,624
60 million 60 million numbers mostly due to starvation mismanagement talk about that

2407
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:05,024
It's the mismanagement of resources

2408
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,792
Government

2409
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,328
And at the same time

2410
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:11,936
Very unfortunately time to Drought that are very

2411
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,496
I've been very seriously a problem in China

2412
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,360
Stop don't get me wrong I'm not saying that mountain f****** kill people

2413
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,456
No

2414
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:28,576
The mismanagement

2415
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:34,976
Your number is thrown around so flippantly

2416
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,512
Two things that are

2417
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
Not incidental but

2418
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,352
It's not extermination

2419
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,376
As much as it is like

2420
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
They f***** up

2421
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,960
You know what

2422
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,752
That wasn't the globalist

2423
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,056
I don't I don't know what else to say about it

2424
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,592
It has nothing to do with

2425
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:53,664
I don't know what's going on here

2426
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,944
What's a goal

2427
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Hitler

2428
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,528
Pray. Pray to

2429
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,296
God

2430
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
The way it won't happen

2431
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:03,904
If you

2432
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:04,928
Your friend

2433
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,696
And all of it

2434
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Together

2435
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,048
Precious

2436
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
Two wonderful

2437
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
Too good of a

2438
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
The place

2439
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,912
To lay down

2440
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,680
As of

2441
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,472
Greatness could arrive

2442
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,288
Once we break the shackles of the

2443
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,312
That's hold

2444
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,592
Stack

2445
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:25,920
Something America has more than any other countries and entrepreneurial

2446
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:31,040
One thing we have more than any other countries with milites innovator

2447
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:31,808
Not true

2448
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
Devil Italy

2449
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,880
Be the trend forecast

2450
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:45,888
Really I wouldn't

2451
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,192
Big Brother

2452
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,728
Doesn't come down on us

2453
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,496
That's harder

2454
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:54,080
Historic cross

2455
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,384
The forces of global

2456
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,944
Are Marching towards absolute

2457
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:01,504
Look in the mirror

2458
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
Count

2459
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
The cost

2460
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
Or

2461
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,976
Will you stand tall

2462
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,256
Freedom lovers everywhere

2463
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,304
And stop the completion

2464
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,584
I'ma World dick

2465
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:33,504
Wait the music was by Rob Jacobson

2466
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:48,096
Not great

2467
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,656
Not good

2468
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,936
Divya animation

2469
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,240
Animation

2470
01:55:54,496 --> 01:56:00,640
Right right

2471
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:07,040
Disappoint

2472
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:13,440
Recorded image lab

2473
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:19,840
Jacobson has a

2474
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:25,984
Webster

2475
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:32,384
Krs-1 Jesse Ventura Willie Nelson wow

01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,472
Frankly it's far worse

2482
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,824
Hear it.

2483
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,360
The claims in this film

2484
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,408
I asked about your job

Betrayal

2488
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:15,136
We have to warn the people that Barack Obama

2489
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:18,208
Fancy teleprompters

2490
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,256
Nothing more than a front man

2491
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
A pitchman

2492
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:28,704
Please get the high-quality DVD

2493
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,496
Wake him up let him know the threat

2494
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:36,896
Global banking system

2495
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,456
Truthout

2496
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,528
You got to get the truth out

2497
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,880
All the evil men and tyrosine to flourish

2498
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,184
So we cannot stand here idle

2499
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,024
Really feel like Thomas Jefferson did today then

2500
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,560
Thank you so much

2501
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,584
Watching

2502
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,608
The Obama Deception

2503
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,912
It's not Thomas

2504
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,960
That's what I mean it's a real quick

2505
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,984
Finally the end of

2506
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,776
Real quote

2507
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Jordan

2508
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,104
This is been coughing

2509
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,384
I think

2510
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:12,736
Thank you so much for putting up with this I don't know what my name is

2511
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,296
I don't know what year it is

2512
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,064
It's Jordan

2513
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,672
Allegheny ms-28

2514
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,952
I remember having

2515
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
Pete Wentz

2516
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,048
Seems like those are no longer available

2517
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,328
Weave

2518
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,400
This

2519
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:35,008
And I want I want I want I want

2520
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,824
As much as

2521
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,848
Do you have felt

2522
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:40,640
The pain of this

2523
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:47,040
I can't imagine I'm so glad to shake off the burden

2524
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:53,440
Of The Obama Deception name for a week

2525
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,208
This

2526
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:54,976
Sucked

2527
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,000
So much

2528
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:58,560
This documentary is utter trash

2529
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,840
But I can't yeah

2530
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,120
I don't think I

2531
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,752
Let's hear you f******

2532
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,568
Not Kevin Hogan

2533
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:11,104
Doing the Hulk Hogan

2534
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,920
I forget that every time I say Hogan

2535
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,480
Listen to me Savage

2536
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,016
Not Michael Savage

2537
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,296
Randy Savage

2538
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,880
I wouldn't want to call him out

2539
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,768
Lex Luger

2540
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:29,536
That's not great

2541
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,816
Listen to me sting

2542
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,608
Not the musician

2543
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:40,544
List how long is this going to go there's a lot of wrestlers who have the same name as something else that comes up in the night

2544
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,336
When we

2545
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,176
Crosby Stills

2546
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:50,272
This documentary when I did

2547
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,808
The hours and hours of

2548
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,344
Research on endgame

2549
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,392
It to me was like

2550
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,696
Kind of fun adventures

2551
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,464
Like I was learning

2552
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:02,816
Rewind about this fun

2553
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,352
It was gross lies

2554
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:07,168
It was just a monster Bez lives

2555
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,704
To find out like oh no that's not

2556
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,008
Yeah

2557
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,544
I had to read books

2558
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:17,920
To find out like what he was talking about

2559
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,968
Starting World War

2560
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:23,040
I found that f****** super fascinating

2561
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:28,416
Nothing in here really was all that fun was if I had to go on these side roads learning about like

2562
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:32,256
Goddamn Louie gohmert

2563
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:38,656
Old like learning about life

2564
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:44,288
That's what I had to do has been incomplete an abject

2565
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:50,688
Failure is almost nothing

2566
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
Documentary

2567
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,880
I can't put in more simple words

2568
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,904
Is trash

2569
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,184
It suck

2570
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,232
There is almost nothing in it that's

2571
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
True

2572
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,536
Over the course of the last

2573
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,584
However many hours

2574
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,888
That we've been doing this all these episodes

2575
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,192
I have found almost

2576
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,216
Nothing

2577
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,776
That is actually true

2578
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,616
Then I'm not talkin about true in the bickersons

2579
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:22,432
I mean true Wednesday were making

2580
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,480
Like when they were making this

2581
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,272
They had to know they were lying

2582
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,064
Yeah there's no way around

2583
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,928
Yep

2584
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
Metal roof sound like

2585
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,792
That's really terrible lie

2586
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,816
Like that you aren't your

2587
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,584
Clearly

2588
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:41,632
You're obviously misrepresenting

2589
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,424
Instant

2590
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,960
Did I sound does Alex

2591
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,496
Merely pushing

2592
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
A doctor

2593
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
Photograph

2594
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Of

2595
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,848
The service

2596
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:56,224
It's f***** up like that sort of thing when I find stuff like that

2597
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,272
You're like I find that and I'm like

2598
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,088
I'd like you suck Alex

2599
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,112
Your job

2600
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
Is to do better

2601
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,464
He's not a truth-teller

2602
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:11,328
It's not like he's tell you specifically the opposite of though he's a live teller

2603
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:14,144
He's a propagandist I'm not expecting him to come to

2604
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,960
A good documentary

2605
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,288
It's going to be a challenge

2606
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:23,360
A break time

2607
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,664
Yeah put together

2608
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,992
Really didn't take that much work

2609
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,064
In quotes

2610
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,600
He took like

2611
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:37,952
100 200 things to look into more like

2612
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:38,976
No

2613
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,000
No

2614
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:44,096
No that's absolutely that misrepresentation

2615
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:48,192
It's like transcribing a half hour recording where it's like

2616
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:52,800
I know I'm only typing a half hour but I have to pause every 5 Seconds

2617
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:58,688
Entirely frustrating

2618
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,760
You know I mean we talk about this all the time it's like

2619
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,552
All our job is

2620
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,344
Stomachs that is to be

2621
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,392
Watchman on the wall

2622
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,160
Core character

2623
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:10,976
Gateway

2624
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:19,168
What we do is we

2625
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:20,448
Look at with Alex's saying

2626
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,240
And try and make

2627
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,008
Make it fun

2628
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,712
Degeneration from endgame

2629
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,480
Who's there

2630
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:33,760
It's only a few

2631
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,528
New Year's

2632
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,808
Evansville wax

2633
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,856
Of care that you put into that

2634
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,136
Liquid endgame

2635
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,928
It's not good

2636
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:45,792
It's

2637
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:51,936
There's a product to it that they do belie professionalism

2638
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:53,472
Documentary

2639
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,752
He repurposed

2640
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,544
Klipsch multiple-time

2641
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,848
He reused from a game

2642
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,664
He use the same score from endgame all done again

2643
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,200
And multiple time

2644
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:06,016
Headies voiceover not match what's on screen

2645
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:11,904
That's clunky as f*** I'm going to give you

2646
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,208
How many

2647
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,232
Atlanta Georgia

2648
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,000
Alright

2649
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
Too long

2650
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,840
Could have got 25 minutes

2651
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,120
Leonard maltin

2652
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:27,264
There is literally no movie that literally has ever reviewed

2653
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,568
You got about 25 minutes

2654
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,336
That's pretty

2655
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,920
Like almost

2656
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:39,808
NTR

2657
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:42,112
Do you disagree on many things

2658
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,136
Spiritually

2659
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,696
You have a little movies and

2660
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:48,768
I just tighten it up

2661
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:57,216
Who is that all the time

2662
02:04:57,472 --> 02:05:01,568
But not for me

2663
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,848
Would like oh

2664
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
You don't give

2665
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:08,480
Is when he gave the list of people on the CFR in the trilateral

2666
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:11,552
Commission Bilderberg

2667
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,344
It's clear like he had somebody

2668
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
Make the graphics

2669
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,256
PowerPoint

2670
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:26,144
Because that's what it look like it look like PowerPoint presentation even then

2671
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,264
5 minutes

2672
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,080
To alter a PowerPoint presentation

2673
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:38,176
With information you have even even to the point where

2674
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:42,784
3 days before you release it you still could have gone in and be like

2675
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,832
I'll just put this shot in

2676
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,600
Instead of this one

2677
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,672
Examples even someone who was

2678
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:52,768
Consideration for National Security

2679
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:56,864
That fly

2680
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,632
Yeah

2681
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,448
Biggest f***** up it's just sloppy it's.

2682
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,240
I love you going to be on

2683
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,264
Glass back

2684
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,288
It's just

2685
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,336
I don't know

2686
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,360
I don't know

2687
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,384
I know

2688
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:11,200
Fun fundamental aspect of Alex's

2689
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,272
Jesus worldview and stuff like that

2690
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:17,344
But when were forced to talk about like when he

2691
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,904
Makes us talk about the Federal Reserve

2692
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,696
It just becomes like

2693
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,000
The illusion of

2694
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,048
This is fun

2695
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,584
Kind of wears away from

2696
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:30,144
Yeah I know because if it comes so much like

2697
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,192
You're lying about this

2698
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:32,960
Intentionally

2699
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:36,800
Learning about the Federal Reserve

2700
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,360
I really enjoyed

2701
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:44,224
I think it's valuable for our listeners cuz I think a lot of people don't know about

2702
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,272
I didn't care

2703
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:52,416
Click the link

2704
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,744
It's good to know those things I think there's value

2705
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,512
YouTube

2706
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,792
Like when you're watching this

2707
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,352
It is so much like a guy

2708
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,400
Almost standing out

2709
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,472
Side of a junior high civics class and going like

2710
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:09,568
You don't want to learn about all that b******* man

2711
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,336
Cool

2712
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:13,408
Come with me and I'll teach you about the real history

2713
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,760
And and it's like you're just training a generation of people who are

2714
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:21,088
Dumb avoid ever learning reality

2715
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,136
That's that's what Alex

2716
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,160
Alex's

2717
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,184
AAA

2718
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,464
F******

2719
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,000
Pied Piper for

2720
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,792
Yeah

2721
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:32,096
Except

2722
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:34,400
Rap

2723
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,168
Good people

2724
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:35,936
Good

2725
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:41,312
Do the paper eventually took kids

2726
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:43,872
The bad guys forgot about that

2727
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:48,992
Yeah nevermind I take that back

2728
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:55,392
What you forgot about red

2729
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:03,584
I thought you were sort of the equivalent of like they Patrick with the specs

2730
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:12,800
Absolute legend about a guy who just got rid of rats

2731
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:16,640
Really well for story

2732
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:21,760
Anyway Jordan I love you thank you for doing this and more

2733
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:24,064
This is a huge burden

2734
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,856
For you I don't mean that

2735
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:28,672
Don't leave like this we did this all day

2736
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:34,560
This is not swears he recording here now its 1 a.m. we've been sitting in this room since noon

2737
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,352
We did

2738
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:39,680
The first one was 9 hours and now we've gone

2739
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,728
So

2740
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:49,152
We we we really we really blew it. We really blew it out for the end of season 2

2741
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,832
My name I really don't remember

2742
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,112
Jordan

2743
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,160
I know I

2744
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,696
I really feel like I want

2745
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,744
Give some sort of a bow on

2746
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,280
I know that I'm

2747
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:09,120
I feel like I'm rambling

2748
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,680
My vote

2749
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:13,728
I deserve this because

2750
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:18,592
Goddamn hours I'm going to give it to you

2751
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,872
Just from

2752
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,896
External

2753
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,920
Viewpoint

2754
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,456
If you look at Alex Jones

2755
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,224
Documentary

2756
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
Yep

2757
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:28,320
What you find is multiple fake quote

2758
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,344
He's using

2759
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,952
At least one instance of a doctor photograph that he's using to smear Obama

2760
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:36,000
At least one instance

2761
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:39,328
Of him using a smear that was used in the 2018

2762
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,864
2008 campaign

2763
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,912
Against Obama what you should know better

2764
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:43,936
By this point

2765
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:44,960
As

2766
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:46,752
If you take

2767
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:50,336
Everything else out of it all the other dumb nonsense

2768
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,872
That alone

2769
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,408
Should be disqualifying

2770
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,200
In terms of it being something

2771
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,480
He should put out

2772
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,552
Liquors that goes our editorial problem

2773
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,112
Anybody who works for a business

2774
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:04,160
Let's say The Huffington Post

2775
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,976
Like I said Alex made this documentary for The Huffington Post

2776
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,768
This one clear the lawyers

2777
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,328
No

2778
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:14,912
Absolutely not we're taking on liability if you you put this out right

2779
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,936
Someone's going to be like

2780
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,960
I hate

2781
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,568
You're using a mirror

2782
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,616
You doctored that photograph

2783
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:26,944
Yeah

2784
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,992
My bow is

2785
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:30,784
The documentary

2786
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,808
Sucks balls

2787
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:32,832
And

2788
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:36,416
It's your nephew

2789
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,440
I got

2790
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,976
Or is it going to make it

2791
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:41,792
I guess

2792
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:44,096
I don't know I'm done

2793
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:46,912
Foundry bad at

2794
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:48,960
Lake Eva

2795
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:50,752
Fixing things

2796
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:51,776
Bums me out

2797
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
Awesome

2798
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,016
Your throne in doctor photograph

2799
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,552
Great keep on going

2800
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:07,904
You're at your consulate you're throwing all these people together who don't belong

2801
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:08,928
Awesome

2802
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:12,768
You're pretending people are Gruen

2803
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,536
What

2804
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:15,072
Do a good job of that

2805
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,376
Don't throw in footage from your other

2806
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:21,216
Comentari don't get people's names wrong

2807
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:24,800
Group name wrong don't throw in there in the wrong

2808
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,080
Someplace like just

2809
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,384
Just like taking it out man

2810
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:33,504
I guess what yeah I guess like if I was a DP on this film I could make it

2811
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,088
1 this was like an hour and 50 minutes long

2812
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:39,648
Shoulda been an hour intent right to

2813
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,672
Tightened it up

2814
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,840
Through line of Lexus IS

2815
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:51,424
Is this keep jumping around

2816
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,496
Still don't know what the movie was about

2817
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:58,848
What's called The Obama Deception

2818
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,384
What is 50

2819
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:07,296
No it's the federal reserve put all the stuff you talk about the Federal Reserve

2820
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:10,368
I don't know either

2821
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:13,184
I think I think what this comes down to it I think both of our

2822
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,464
Complaints to be synthesized

2823
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,512
Quality assured

2824
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:19,840
This is bad

2825
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,400
If you're going to put this out

2826
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:28,544
