26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
What's address

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Twisters that I know a ton about Alex Jones

33
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,040

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
On the fact

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
433

36
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
It's not exactly what I anticipated

37
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
Is no part of me that would have predicted

38
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
That I would be

39
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736

Just trying to derail this week

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
Those were things man I got a little bit further down the track

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648

The scourge of every conversation

106
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Absolutely

132
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Something going on in Fort Worth

133
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
To defeat the Huns

134
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Alex isn't Court

135
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
So you can't do is show

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
He's in court during the hours that the show is going on

137
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
So two days out of a week David

138
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
And I could not lift

139
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
No the other day

00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Paul Joseph Watson who's visiting Austin

141
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
At this point

142
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Great

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,263
Hit by truck narratives that he's been spinning are completely bogus

144
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
I just want to take a second without playing his voice

145
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Explain what he's been talk

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
About

147
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
The first thing is Malcolm Nance

148
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
He's a pundit and former

149
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Extensive experience in the

150
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
World

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
He is an expert on Al-Qaeda

152
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Is Terrorism

153
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Specialist

154
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Antique

155
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
Trump Hotel Istanbul

156
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
To be the first Target

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Terrorism against

158
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Prop prop

159
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Nominated meaning

160
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,199
Is the most likely thing or nominated meaning he was like

161
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
That is

162
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
Version of what you're saying is what

163
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,839
Gotcha you saying is predict that will be the first because of course

164
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,679
Of course the World Trade Center

165
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Predicted that would be the target

166
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Because it had already been the target one time but

167
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
I nominate this to be the next you're not saying hey terrorist

168
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Get at it

169
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
You know this is the most likely

170
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,623
Oscar thing all over again maybe they hit it but they

171
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
They got the wrong place we watching

172
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Yeah we're going tomorrow I'll go

173
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
8120 language

174
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
What's the term nominate

175
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
I think probably because

176
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
It was

177
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
Matthew language

178
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Yes it wasn't

179
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
This guy

180
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Rhetorically in bed with the Muslims

181
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
The second thing is there was a shooter in

182
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
Who went on Facebook live

183
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Send shot that old man

184
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
Yeah yeah it up a couple days later killing himself after he was on the Run

185
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Boulders apartment tweeted out a picture

186
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Headline news type thing

187
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Haha

188
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,687
There was a cropped picture and it just showed Cleveland shooter at large considered armed and dangerous

189
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
And there was a silhouette

190
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Picture like a like a random Place holder

00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Avatar image

192
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
Let me get this

193
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Please

194
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
CNN

195
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Doesn't have

196
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
To publish to let everybody know that it

197
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
The black man

198
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
You nailed it

199
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
Let me ask you one further question

200
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Was this a

201
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Totally accurate

202
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
And factual thing that

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
He tweeted out

204
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
No because the pictures it was photo

205
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
The picture was photoshopped

206
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
With the silhouette Avatar

207
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Picture

208
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
And then

209
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
To the right of it

210
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Is a picture of

211
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
He's old he is posting

212
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Just completely inaccurate things in order to race Bay

213
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Someone point

214
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
You didn't apologize

215
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,335
And when he was hosting the Alex Jones Show

216
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Brought it up

217
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
Why won't see you then play that this guy is black

218
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Possibly

219
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
So he has to know

220
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Yeah

221
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
He knows

222
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Absolutely

223
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
And then he still goes and f******

224
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
Says it in in a public sphere

225
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
People can hear him

226
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Are already on edge

227
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Hoping that

228
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Somebody like that

229
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Like

230
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Kind of

231
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
And according to quadcast

232
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
The statistics are that almost

233
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,223
Old white men

234
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
And

235
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
I got some weird statista

236
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
Took the breakdown later so that I found

237
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
On this planet

238
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
It's going with this is kind of been up to

239
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Huseman

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Just watch

241
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
Be honest without the quick editing that he does

242
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
In his videos

243
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
He's not ready for Primetime baby

244
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
He is not good at that desk

245
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Okay he's not there yet

246
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Does he

247
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Realize

248
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
So much on quick edit

249
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
That just having him

250
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
For 10 minutes

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
No personality

252
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
No

253
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Give know it

254
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Which is

255
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
F******

256
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,279
By the the he was on air with

257
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
What if Alex Jones

258
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,599
Yeah I still think Paul Joseph Watson

259
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
I think that's

260
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
I still think it's the end of info

261
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Alex Jones

262
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Is the cult leader

263
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
And when you take the cult leader down

264
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
The end of the

265
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
If you're not good

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
If you're not good about how you

267
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
You take down that colt

268
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
You have

269
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Charismatic

270
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Figure rise through the ranks

271
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
And take over

272
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
The leader dies

273
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Yeah one else comes

274
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,783
Yeah but it's not generations of the Branch Davidians

275
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
That's out of Alex's at UVA

276
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
And then David koresh

277
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
Right leader comes

278
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Please go off the rails

279
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Suicide

280
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
So I think that

281
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Alex does end up going down

282
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
And you end up with

283
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
A new leader ascending

284
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
You'll just you'll see it fell apart much quicker

285
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
But I still think

286
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Google

287
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Alex Jones has done a really good job of building up

288
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
Individual that fits their own demographic

289
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
15

290
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Do you have Owen Shroyer

291
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Kind of like a frat boy

292
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Who's kind of like

293
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Cool bro

294
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
Like he's 27 years old

295
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
He's kind of smarmy

296
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Like a man

297
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Play basketball

298
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Then you got

299
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
Alright

300
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
When you get robbed

301
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
You got robbed 2

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Coos

303
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Huge nerds can identify with Rob do

304
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
And I'll kind of guy

305
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Got that

00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
You got

307
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
The f****** smoke shop of a lady

308
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Superhot Lee Ann McAdoo

309
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
Fox News

310
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
She's not blonde

311
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
She's going to dirty brunette

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:07,359
Okay well there was strawberry brought blocked at least more diverse

313
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Fox News

314
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
Slightly so then

315
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,551
You got Millie Weaver was kind of like a young sorority girls

316
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Discovered that sort of demography

317
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,951
Sometimes clouds and rainbows match

318
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
Then you got

319
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
F****** you got

320
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
I don't know why you got Jon rappoport but you got them

321
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
David Knight for the old folks

322
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
People who are a little bit more night

323
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
You got

324
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
Jerome corsi for the race

325
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
You got Anthony cumia for the people who loves Opie and Anthony

326
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
You know

327
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
I'm against peace

328
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
How many people actually work

329
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Missing people

330
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
It was just them everybody who has

331
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Beard on screen

332
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Also does double duty as like the boom operators out on the road

333
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
I've seen video of him holding up iPhone

334
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Beautiful

335
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
He's basically made

336
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Segments of

337
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
The youth population that are covered by

338
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Each of his

339
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Trying to hit all four quad right

340
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
Unfortunately all of his quadrants are old

341
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
So I'm confused as to why he thinks that

342
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,799
It's a good idea if he were to go down there is

343
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,383
Conceivable like all of them for like Voltron

344
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Incapable

345
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Unit

346
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
Cuz they all have their own little segments

347
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
Like

348
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
What's

349
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
Mark Wahlberg

350
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Most

351
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
At the very beginning

352
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Sutherland izan

353
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
And then Mark Wahlberg

354
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
No Donald

355
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
About

356
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,703
I don't know

357
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
My point is

358
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
The pjw

359
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
So we're not going to be talking about covering

360
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,319
W any further than we already have

361
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Possibly

362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Against as lawyers wishes

363
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Has been

364
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Dispatching

365
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
From the road

366
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
As it were

367
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
I think he's shooting videos in the courthouse

368
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Daybreak

369
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
God

370
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Because there are

371
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
There are videos

372
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
That he's shooting in front of like what appears to be an in

373
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Firewall of legal books

374
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
I would I would describe it

375
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
Good all these books

376
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,783
Match Lee looks like 1,000

377
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Part encyclopedia

378
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Like it's just going to all all the books are like

379
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
That's what it looks like

380
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
You cannot pull them out

381
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
I can't imagine that Ruby

382
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
You've been recording

383
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
North Korea is coming at all this

384
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Talk about that

385
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
This week

386
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Those like fighter

387
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
Buy boats

388
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,143
Future

389
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Because of course not a national security

390
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
He's lying about things

391
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Right

392
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
They should have seen that coming that's on them

393
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
You can't with with tropical don't even get fool me once quote the band

394
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
If you've already gotten

395
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,351
Dislike

396
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
It's all stupid

397
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
WeatherTech

398
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,591
Video that came out on Friday

399
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
What will be discussing

400
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:29,247
Aired on the Alex Jones Show up Paul Joseph Watson

401
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
This video came out on Thursday

402
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
And keep in mind

403
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
And on Thursday

404
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Alex had put out

405
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
A statement

406
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:45,375
Please respect my privacy and my family's privacy I'm not going to be

407
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,703
The press that was on Thursday this videos on Friday

408
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
He is now talking

409
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,127
If you consider Infowars and pjw

410
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
So this video is

411
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
This video is ostensibly

412
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
About Bill O'Reilly

413
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
It really feels like he's working through some stuff

414
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
And he's using Bill O'Reilly as an

415
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Excuse

416
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
Okay here's the introduction of the premise

417
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Here we go

418
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
I haven't commented yet on Bill O'Reilly being let go from Fox

419
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Stanford

420
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
I've been on the air

421
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
O'Reilly

422
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,519
Real really know which direction this is going to go

423
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:02,175
Cuz it sounds

424
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
Could be about

425
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,063
I love the mystery of it like

426
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
I'm legitimately

427
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
When I was listening to it I was like

428
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
Dammit I'm stymied

429
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
I don't know which way I should have

430
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
O'Reilly's

431
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,103
Shows like that

432
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
He's a complicated you're also I'd like to find out the Bill O'Reilly according to

433
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
IMDb never appeared on extra until 2015

434
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
So

435
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,231
I think what he meant was Inside Edition

436
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Junk magazine shows

437
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
There

438
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,399
TV nonsense

439
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
At some point

440
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Extra

441
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,295
Proto

442
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,240
Yes those are is too late for us today and we will leave

443
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
He's playing the recorder

444
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Conveniently

445
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Include the part where you start

446
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Screaming obscenities

447
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
What is that mean it's clear that Bill O'Reilly isn't he doesn't understand

448
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
A sentence with

449
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
You understand

450
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
Okay

451
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
He was on TV in the 80s.

452
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
Proto Infowars

453
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
If it weren't for well

454
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
It was nice to Bill O'Reilly

455
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,576
But we all know that Alex

456
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,952
No matter what

457
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
To eat sold out

458
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Like that

459
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,192
Still not sure without where the ball is going to break

460
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
I'm not

461
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
Although I will say that in this neck

462
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
The Alex doesn't reduce

463
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
It is a little bit on

464
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
So all deals

465
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
Oh no we're being unfair to the gyro cycle at 30 years old

466
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
For having a security team

467
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:02,656
New York actually

468
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,976
I mean there are plenty of instances you can find of Alex yelling at callers to

469
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Text one

470
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
To Noah

471
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,144
Is this is this going to turn into Alex Jones criticizing Bill O'Reilly

472
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
Everything Alex Jones

473
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,800
I think he's working for me

474
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
He's looking at

475
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
His own future

476
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,944
Maybe if any continue if he has a future

477
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Eventually we'll catch

478
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Good. We don't meet

479
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
We should be covering stuff like

480
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,976
Like this coming out in

481
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
The court

482
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Case

483
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
That if true

484
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
A real bad

485
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Use it you think he laid a hand on your land

486
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
I don't know

487
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
There it is

488
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
This is why I wear this is why we're truly

489
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Anyway

490
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
He's up there saying Bill O'Reilly

491
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Security

492
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,016
Why two colors

493
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Not true

494
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,928
No but I sounds like it's a very plausible

495
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
I didn't do that

496
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
Bucking stock

497
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
I don't know about that but probably I believe it

498
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,896
So why not why wouldn't he send a security detail to a random colors house

499
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Media Matters they have

500
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,160
The audio of what Alex is talking about Bill O'Reilly show

501
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Which I will play now

502
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,888
Hey Bill I appreciate you taking a call during the day I think Keith Overman shuvit

503
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Diego Mike is

504
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
He's a guy on guy

505
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
We have your phone

506
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
So if you listening Mike we have your

507
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
And we're going to turn it over to Fox

508
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
And You Begin

509
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Maybe Mike is from

510
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,368
Because we're not going to play around when you call Ashley's Gentleman Just so you know

511
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
We do have your phone

512
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
And if you say anything untoward obbs

513
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Or anything like that

514
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Fox Acura

515
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Then we'll contact

516
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Authorities

517
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
And

518
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
You will be

519
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
There

520
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
F*** are you talking about

521
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,688
Noticed that it just caught and let me know

522
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
What are you doing live radio

523
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
He said some

524
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,512
Yeah and they have that there because the SEC will find them

525
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
Swears on air

526
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
The Janet Jackson

527
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
Right it's always been

528
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Have

529
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Chops

530
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
Take them off the air and the square would never make it

531
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,040
Unless tons of people

532
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
And they would eat up to seven

533
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,952
As is

534
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,560
The problem with you or something like that

535
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
We don't know that

536
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Right

537
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
The idea that

538
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
He's saying

539
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,312
I don't agree with your position I'm going to send security

540
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
To you

541
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
Is not fair we don't have enough information

542
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
He's having fun

543
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
Security call the local authorities

544
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
For somebody

545
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Swearing at him

546
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
But that's that might not be the situation the guy might have said I'm going

547
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Peculiar

548
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
That out

549
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
I don't know

550
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Compelling

551
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
I don't know I don't know

552
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Howard Stern been threatened

553
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
With death on air

554
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
I don't know I didn't really look

555
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
Discern

556
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,432
Broadcast radio Schofield

557
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,064
Exciting popular made a lot more money and had a lot more listeners

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Cousin Alex Johnson

559
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
Isaac the radio Factor has been on for

560
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Decade

561
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Yeah

562
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Also did we actually do a rundown of

563
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Makes the most money

564
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
From radio and wasn't O'Reilly

565
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Up there

566
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
A nose

567
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,104
He had a huge audience whenever he was on but yeah now it's

568
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
The two will get into the specifics

569
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Six when he brings up another lie later but

570
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,160
It's interesting cuz at this point it is still he's painting this picture of like Wally the complex guy

571
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,512
Also just refuses to address the fact that he's getting fired

572
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
For sexually harassing

573
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Tons of women

574
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
Oh yeah you wouldn't want to

575
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
You wouldn't

576
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Look

577
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
Alex wouldn't want to put out there

578
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
That he's against

579
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Dangerous

580
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Position to take a nap

581
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
Yeah I think so

582
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Clubwear

583
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
He's gets mad at Bill Riley can you say p**** on the radio

584
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Like

585
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
Like if you

586
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Called Alex

587
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
On the radio

588
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
He would probably

589
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Hang up on you

590
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
What do you leave it in there

591
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,608
I don't know

592
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
He keeps them so much that he shouldn't so I don't know why only thing

593
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
That's the only thing I

594
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,920
I know

595
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,760
Donate to our patreon for my birthday present

596
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
Be able to get Alex Jones has karaoke anyway clips

597
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Escape from the factory

598
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
Sexual problem

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
He says this

600
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
No

601
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,272
But it's not like get in

602
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
The fact that Bill O'Reilly says

603
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
Is great

604
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,352
Sure is it a research yourself conservative

605
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Wind-up car

606
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
With a red Galore

607
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,312
Who does regular

608
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,152
Misused term

609
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
Yeah basically

610
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Here is the

611
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
So Alec suspended narrative

612
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Before

613
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
O'Reilly's

614
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Used

615
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
Image of

616
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
I had his picture up there and then subtract

617
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Could be availed

618
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
I like hey check this out

619
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
That's pretty funny

620
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
A timing thing

621
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
Because it didn't happen

622
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
Alex Alex plays

623
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
What he's talking about

624
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
What you just said

625
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,808
He plays the clip from The O'Reilly Factor

626
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
Sexual harassment

627
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
Sex crimes or pedophilia at all

628
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Here listen

629
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
But Alex just

630
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,584
Just made that up in real time

631
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Seargeoh

632
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Psycho Killer

633
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,696
Well

634
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Wait

635
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,304
Nothing

636
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Things to do with

637
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
The fraud tax scam

638
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
Tea Party

639
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,960
Facebook censoring South

640
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
I had nothing to do the thing that Alex claims

641
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
You so mad about

642
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
Cuz I never looked into

643
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
I don't want to go

644
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Dig through

645
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
F****** O'Reilly we should have known

646
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,440
He was like whatever you take antibiotics says Eli

647
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Although that does sound

648
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
That does sound like some chips

649
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
O'Reilly

650
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
But it turns out it's just completely in Alex's head

651
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
It's just

652
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
100

653
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,920
You could make an argument

654
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
O'Reilly in that is a very complex

655
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,808
But very unlike O'Reilly

656
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Like O'Reilly in

657
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
That they're both fun

658
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Yep

659
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
Fortunate

660
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Aunt

661
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
It is unfortunate

662
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Is that like

663
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
We have a joke

664
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
That we're up against

665
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
But he is an idiot

666
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,728
Like if Joker was just really dumb and yelled a lot that's basically

667
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,568
In the Dark Knight all of those complicated plans are just like

668
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,688
Robin

669
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,760
What situation for a ride.

670
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Cell rap

671
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
Crystal.

672
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Up

673
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
Also he

674
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Unfortunately

675
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,288
His report was doctored

676
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,872
Our listeners we like we don't have any of those

677
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Tweeters

678
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
Things people do

679
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Just hang the picture

680
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
I'm changing my birthday wish

681
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
Everyone Jon rappoport is Twitter handle is at John

682
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Jon rappoport

683
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Just ask him about the picture

684
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
Picture is

685
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Where did the

686
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
In the middle

687
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
Cuz it's not what you would do with the picture you love

688
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Complex

689
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
His second wife

690
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Picture that she ever

691
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,368
As far as I can tell he's been married

692
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
For years and years

693
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
My friend

694
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
He goes on Skype

695
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
To see his other children

696
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
DeForest auto detailing

697
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
He tries to heal the babies

698
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,800
To get vaccines brainwashing

699
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
Not necessarily wrong on that one

700
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
Not necessarily right so this next trip we finally get into the fact that

701
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
Bill O'Reilly the sexual

702
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
Taking a little while but we're there

703
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
About me

704
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
And Rodger Ailes

705
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
So

706
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
I love that I love that

707
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Rollaway bed

708
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Course they

709
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Of course

710
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
If I done that

711
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,152
The symbol of masculinity

712
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
Are you are you a cheerleader

713
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,856
As long as long as the girls have a

714
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,440
Spring in their step

715
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,512
Thank you Alex

716
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
August 5th

717
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,656
Clip of the episode finally getting into the fact that Bill O'Reilly is a sexual harasser

718
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
And that is

719
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,104
Episode

720
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
Alex then going on to muddy the waters

721
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
And claiming

722
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
That first of all

723
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
There's other people who are worse

724
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
You got it

725
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Globalist

726
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
REM play

727
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Global instalike

728
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
For Global

729
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,584
Yep this is

730
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Before he gets to that

731
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Install

732
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Narrative

733
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
How to get to like

734
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Really big like

735
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
Bill's bad but

736
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
What about these other play

737
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
The people play that is like

738
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
Biggest example is what about those emails

739
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,136
Obama

740
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,928
We can have that conversation

741
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Not really going

742
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
You know like

743
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Just saying

744
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
Absolutely

745
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
Is Bunker delivery tail lights

746
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
You better stop bombing those people cuz that's

747
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224
Now

748
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,904
Did you know that when you was at the George soros-funded command bunker

749
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
If you make it

750
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Two terms as president

751
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
I think and pick when and where you want to use

752
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
I think that's a good system

753
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
I think I think that's a nice reward that's a golden parachute

754
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
You know methadone

755
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
You got a weave someone off

756
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
You can't just have them come down

757
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:43,552
Just go from Bob and to not exactly you need to wind down

758
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
Anyway this is

759
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
What about it

760
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Government

761
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,768
Roblox

762
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
So you shouldn't have said you agreed

763
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,592
Because first of all that's a clunky analogy

764
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
The Snowden scandal

765
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,064
Difference between the letter in the spirit of Elijah

766
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Before

767
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
You know like

768
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
UK

769
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Spirit

770
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,584
The letter of the law is a literal interpretation

771
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Things like

772
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Kids deals

773
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
The gum from the store you lock him up

774
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
The spirit of the laws

775
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
Figuring out what the laws are made for

776
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
What kind of behaviors they are there too

777
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Create in the population

778
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
The things you do not like

779
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
To see if I'm not applying your legal strategy

780
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
To enforce those things

781
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
When you realize that locking up a kid

782
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
For stealing a piece of gum

783
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
Create more issues and the spirit of the law would say

784
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
No go with a warning

785
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Well because that's not why

786
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Your $0.45 piece

787
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Is that how much gum cost

788
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:47,200
America gum game

789
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Isabel

790
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
To the

791
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
To the corner store to get a piece of gum

792
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
Cup of coffee

793
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
Preferred nickel

794
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
You got to say

795
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,512
Play Genesis perilli go down there

796
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Play some Missouri

797
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Who cares

798
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,168
There's a place called arrowrock

799
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,752
It was like a fake old timey community that they take student

800
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,360
Do on field trips and stuff like that

801
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
General Store

802
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
Niger by like really old

803
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Candy not like not like

804
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,648
Old fashioned types of candy

805
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Yeah I really enjoyed it but

806
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
My point is

807
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,984
I like

808
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
I mean there are there is a problem with abusive children Hollywood clearly a there are stories that keep coming

809
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
Those doors

810
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Others lives that have been ruined

811
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
Example

812
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Over and over again

813
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
Conversation

814
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
We would very much like them to be prosecuted as well

815
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,352
But just because they're not

816
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,656
Computer does not mean that Bill O'Reilly then

817
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Because we're apparently going from

818
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
From the bottom up

819
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
Is menopause

820
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Finally got Bill O'Reilly out of there

821
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
I just wish you would f****** go to jail

822
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
Cuz this is

823
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
To do this thing where he's like

824
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
If every problem is installed why we solving one

825
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,976
Sort of a really

826
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
You can't get anything done

827
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
Actionable goal

828
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
We have to set plans that you can actually build tour

829
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
If you just

830
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
You're just going to

831
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,687
Be overwhelmed by the task in front of you

832
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Smallest thing.

833
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Get Bill O'Reilly f******

834
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
Fired from Fox News

835
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
So you can't hurt more people

836
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
It's really frustrating

837
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
I mean on the one level he's dumb

838
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
But on the other is actually advocating things that are

839
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Just bad

840
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
Beyond

841
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,423
Not that they're not good ways to live

842
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
It just on wise

843
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
Goals and work towards them

844
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Little Steps

845
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,383
That's the way to go anyway here's the clip where he starts to get into

846
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Conspiracy

847
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
And it's

848
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:05,855
Good morning

849
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,839
Arthur episode

850
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
That's a dumb non word

851
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Hear me out on this

852
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
This goes back to our third episode

853
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
The Secret of 2017

854
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
We what is it

855
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,455
We still don't know

856
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
The Secret of 27

857
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
19 is a lot of people are going to lose their

858
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,415
Alex crying about wanting to live in a farmhouse and all this s*** Megyn Kelly is awful

859
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
That was the secret 2017

860
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,559
Possibly have known how the first four months of this year we're going to shake out

861
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
I saw someone I remember it maybe was

862
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,447
I think I might have been like w kamau Bell

863
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,055
A list of people who gear is not going

864
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
Absolutely

865
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
Cheapest

866
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:05,759
And he missed the secret of 27 for someone who has so many high-level

867
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,343
Fake sources and what-have-you if they were real you would think he would see

868
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
Any of these blows coming before they

869
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
He is not

870
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,071
I think it's appropriate now for us to revisit equip that we played

871
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
In the secret of 27

872
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
19 episode

873
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Relevant

874
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
About

875
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Before we do

876
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,799
He was saying there the Megyn Kelly is a part of this

877
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
Patriot values

878
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Like that

879
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
And it's worth noting that Megyn Kelly did do an interview this week

880
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,271
What you talked about Bill O'Reilly was part of the reason the

881
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
But you left Fox News

882
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Damso was Rodger Ailes there was a taco

883
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
The conveyor

884
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
So you can't work in

885
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
If your woman

886
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
How much

887
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
Keep him off

888
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Sandpoint

889
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
What is this

890
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Like how the f*** did he

891
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,687
For millions of dollars over and over and over again

892
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
For the rest of his

893
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,807
I think that at this point is becoming a thing where he's like

894
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,159
Something years old I don't either

895
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,487
George W

896
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
One of them

897
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,679
I'd like a monster

898
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
If we're being

899
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Real with it

900
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Obama and Bill Clinton

901
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Should too

902
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,223
Absolutely pretty much all of our presidents

903
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,367
Has been done. Okay

904
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Killed

905
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Revived

906
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
And then hung

907
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
Picture of the White House

908
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,863
Ended

909
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
Memory of the fact that he's talking

910
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,639
We celebrate Merkel had Hitler's put your up in the air

911
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,199
It's absolutely unacceptable

912
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
I don't know

913
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
I don't know

914
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
We're all going crazy

915
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,439
Make America gems

916
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,839
So close to America if everybody donates

917
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
Patreon

918
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
And I I don't know if I said it on the show

919
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
We will record at least

920
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
One audio commentary

921
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
For one of Alex Jones movie

922
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
We will do that

923
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
I'm willing to do it

924
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,575
We're going to do what we're going to do a full mst3k

925
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
Alex Jones and a new series of mst3k

926
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Chicago public

927
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
TV show

928
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Where is faith

929
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
We could afford that

930
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Content

931
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,407
I feel like I'm saying that too much

932
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Contacts

933
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,319
Yeah because now I'm saying we'll make me

934
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
F*** off to you

935
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,975
But mostly I was thinking to myself anyway

936
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
In honor of this

937
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
Bringing back up Megyn Kelly

938
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,863
I want to replay this because

939
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
It's horrible

940
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,495
It's fun now in the context that we know the part of

941
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
The reason that she left

942
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Sexual harassment environment

943
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
And people are going down for it

944
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
And this

945
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
Is how Alex Jones back

946
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Beginning of 2017

947
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
It is video 2017

948
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Spoke about

949
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Can Kelly

950
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
Houston

951
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
You look at

952
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
She's a woman

953
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Megyn Kelly

954
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Cheerleader

955
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Who looked okay

956
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
Which I forgot about

957
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,687
Fall he is

958
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,247
She's wanted to go jump remember that way

959
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Ship

960
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Because she feels weird

961
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,135

963
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
This is just her thinking oh my God I'm hated Fox

964
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
NBC

965
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Cuz those failures

966
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Swindle into joining

967
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,335

968
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
Code is vampire mates pedophile

969
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
Pedophile

970
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
She left because of a

971
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,855
Horrible chauvinistic environment

972
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Responses

973
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Critique her attractive

00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Insist

975
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
He's told friend

976
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
But you think she's ugly

977
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
This is horrible

978
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:13,983
That's the only reason women do things right

979
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Usable level

980
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
Ugly mammal

981
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
Ugly mailman

982
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
So disgusting

983
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
Yeah

984
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
All men should just be we have we have genetic research

985
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
We can clone

986
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
We cannot let you know

987
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,695
Feel bunch of sperm and then get rid of it

988
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
I got plenty

989
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:47,263
Just f****** tear them down if there's one thing I know about man it's that they're not

990
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,663
So thrilled to hold onto those you get rid of

991
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,455
Rubbing one out

992
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,015
Straight into the

993
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
Absolutely

994
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Okay

995
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
I'm not saying

996
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
This is a great

997
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,023
I'm just blue skies

998
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,839
How do you want to kill

999
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
Everybody has their own preference

1000
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Sure

1001
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Cool app

1002
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,775
Kind of indicative of how at this point

1003
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
It's not really clear what he thinks

1004
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,895
About the Bill O'Reilly situation

1005
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
He has acknowledged

1006
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:31,039
Then he's a sexual harassing person Hollywood

1007
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
All of Hollywood

1008
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
Whatever

1009
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:40,255
I meant actually what's going on is it wasn't so much about the

1010
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
Sexually harass people

1011
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
He was a patriot

1012
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
There's a purge going on

1013
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,447
Who is so unclear what is a year at Fox News

1014
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
For 12 hours

1015
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
Get rid of old white

1016
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,335
They just run around all day

1017
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
Hit the Patriots

1018
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
And that includes the football

1019
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,295
They may be there they may not be there

1020
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Yep

1021
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,671
I would also assume that

1022
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
Here's a clip

1023
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
I want to see

1024
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Two things that I haven't pointed out

1025
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,583
This is straight through

1026
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,655
The eclipse are jumped segment

1027
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,959
Just chop his entire thing

1028
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Everything out

1029
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Recording

1030
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
As he drives

1031
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
The court

1032
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
This is in his car

1033
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,503
This is what he thinks about on the way to

1034
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:38,111
Yeah absolutely go to send my right to have my kids

1035
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
I got a

1036
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Can talk about Bill O'Reilly

1037
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,791
For 15 minutes to make sure that everybody knows Bill O'Reilly is not that bad

1038
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
I don't know

1039
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
No I don't know

1040
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
I mean

1041
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
We even actually said that

1042
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
What Bill O'Reilly did

1043
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,407
Somewhere in like

1044
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
Media mattress

1045
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,991
I think that

1046
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
He thinks

1047
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
All he did was

1048
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
Trying you this position

1049
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
To get women to have sex

1050
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
As opposed to

1051
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Right

1052
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
Turn off on its own Alex's dealing with the fact that some women probably

1053
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Corner

1054
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
Broke

1055
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
I would I think that those are things that

1056
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,775
Most likely happen

1057
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
He used demeaning language

1058
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Sexualized

1059
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
Professional

1060
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
It's called that one lady hot chocolate

1061
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
A black lady

1062
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
The Worksource

1063
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,575
Oh boy

1064
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
He's minimize

1065
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
Icing for sure

1066
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
But I think the

1067
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
Still implying that his behavior was

1068
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Yeah

1069
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,303
But anyway this is just like

1070
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
York

1071
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
They paid out like 25 million

1072
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
20 million in

1073
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Sexual harass

1074
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
25 million

1075
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
Rodger Ailes got some huge

1076
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
The number to like

1077
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,711
They paid Rodger Ailes and

1078
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
Is Bill O'Reilly mortal

1079
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
They paid the women

1080
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
It's in their contract like there's there's not much

1081
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
That they can do about it

1082
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
Contract why do you have

1083
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:28,191
Here's your money comes back to them being really marketable Stars

1084
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
Good executive

1085
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
In terms of getting the

1086
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
Getting high rating

1087
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,407
And Bill O'Reilly

1088
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
With Bill O'Reilly and fox

1089
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
I want

1090
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
1 claws

1091
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,647
Bill O'Reilly in the

1092
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
Desiree

1093
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
I'll take I'll take

1094
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
2 million

1095
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
As long as I get to put a toe

1096
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Right through his balls

1097
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,215
Do you get a running start stationary

1098
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Okay

1099
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
Okay

1100
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,223
This clip is Alex not really knowing what side he

1101
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
It's it's

1102
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
It's bizarre

1103
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:28,095
Real Steel

1104
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:01,887
Resent

1105
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:08,287
Red

1106
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,071
Via killie's heel

1107
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
Sexually aroused

1108
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:38,239
Right right

1109
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,567
Invisible to all their racism and their f***

1110
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,895
King liar sir

1111
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
Shoot that arrow in

1112
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,503
To their sexual harassment

1113
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,087
They have to fight against feminists

1114
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,111
PC culture

1115
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
Is because

1116
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,695
You know all those people would go away

1117
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
Then that Achilles heel would never be at

1118
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
I love

1119
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
It's f****** argh

1120
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
If they can take down those guys

1121
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,311
Then hate Vicky

1122
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,383
Which is basically saying like

1123
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
Harass

1124
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,855
There's a world

1125
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
Gets that suppress

1126
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,327
Can't sexually harass people

1127
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,031
Ouroboros solid

1128
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Exist until like 30

1129
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
Mercury in this clip

1130
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
You nailed some of them

1131
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,527
Really really dumb

1132
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
To tie himself

1133
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Like because

1134
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
The issue

1135
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,951
The issue is the Bill O'Reilly and Rodger Ailes

1136
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
Intimately and literally committed crime

1137
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
But he think

1138
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
And it's the globalist

1139
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,311
And I know you got more to saying you're going to kick ass and putting my hand I love you

1140
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Philly rant

1141
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Crime

1142
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Yeah buddy

1143
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Timer

1144
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
The globalist

1145
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:31,903
O'Reilly's got in trouble in the past before

1146
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,999
Audio came out of him like talking about a lady in a falafel

1147
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
But

1148
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Nothing happened

1149
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:53,919
Two people in the past what it happened was sponsors weren't willing to pull

1150
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,015
It got to a point where they could no longer

1151
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
We can be a

1152
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Get tied in with

1153
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
Real-time sponsors

1154
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Kept falling off

1155
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
Any ended up ending his show like

1156
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,607
15 minutes early one day because it had no content to fill it and no ads

1157
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,911
Shepard Smith

1158
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,959
Live in the other serious

1159
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,007
Yeah it's crazy

1160
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Which is

1161
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,711
Paper

1162
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,063
Tying in his fate

1163
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,135
Because what's going on is a crime is being punished

1164
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
It's not free speech being

1165
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
And if he ties himself

1166
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
And with this

1167
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Unfortunately

1168
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,911
The metaphor in the analogy is that what

1169
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
He is on trial for his a crime

1170
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
And it's not

1171
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
Is the custody

1172
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
And

1173
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,615
The more he releases videos like this

1174
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,407
Spending sexual harassment

1175
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Almost seems like you subconsciously want

1176
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Toulouse cost

1177
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
Oh man

1178
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:13,023
How big can of worms

1179
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,863
Also sort of by proxy arguing that you're saying

1180
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
The timing

1181
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
Of this Bill O'Reilly

1182
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Yes

1183
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,543
Intentional and the people are trying to

1184
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Destroy him

1185
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
Yeah

1186
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,663
Yeah

1187
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Don't

1188
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,207
Destroy them too I don't know this is very murky territory

1189
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
The Secret of 2017

1190
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Is

1191
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,143
Who turned in the trailer

1192
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
Uno

1193
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,007
Common real

1194
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
Is it going to be is that again

1195
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,663
Christie novel everyone did it everyone is

1196
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Alex

1197
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
Juicy islamophobia

1198
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:20,607
Take note 6

1199
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:25,727
I bow down to Alex

1200
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
In this clip

1201
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
O'Reilly down

1202
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:05,919
What happened

1203
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:18,719
Weather in England

1204
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
Doesn't

1205
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
It is

1206
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
Is the feminist slogan like

1207
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:49,951
Let's bring those call hijabs back to Pennsylvania that we were talking about what's going on here

1208
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:55,583
Party

1209
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Love is

1210
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,055
It comes out almost like a Dennis Miller

1211
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
Like

1212
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Alright man

1213
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,503
I know that there are

1214
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Terrorist event

1215
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
There are things that he is correct

1216
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,767
It is not a

1217
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,143
But government and CIA and all of those Buckhead

1218
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Have back

1219
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Manny

1220
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,007
Terrorist organizations they

1221
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
They've done all of this s*** like

1222
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,847
Rim thing is us

1223
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
Rehab

1224
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,943
Let's take a step back

1225
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,527
What's the address

1226
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,343
Where the LIE is Alex's truth

1227
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
Because these things are true

1228
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,415
But the light comes

1229
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
From the fact

1230
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
Implying

1231
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,255
Fayetteville

1232
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
Parts of the government

1233
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:05,471
George W bush would be included

1234
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,263
Anybody who's

1235
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
Implication

1236
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,431
Is that they're backing these terror group

1237
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
For their terrorism

1238
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,527
They're selling children into slavery

1239
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,367
When in reality often time

1240
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,183
It's proxy wars that don't go well

1241
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231
And you need somebody

1242
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,839
To fight as opposed to us because if we fought there it would trigger

1243
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,167
So you have

1244
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,847
No but it's not what Alex's describe

1245
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,663
Also and then again

1246
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
He does that say

1247
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Before

1248
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Where he staying in

1249
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
They care about women

1250
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
It is that

1251
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
Lifetime to get

1252
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
I'm out of here

1253
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,463
Which has that same ring of

1254
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Well

1255
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,815
Because they don't all women traffic

1256
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
Then it doesn't

1257
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Then

1258
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,727
They don't care about the the certain problem

1259
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,055
Just because you don't solve everything doesn't mean

1260
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
You can't solve 1

1261
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
What

1262
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
You know I'm not a

1263
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,015
Foreign policy and War historian or anything like that

1264
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
At least two stomachs

1265
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Groups

1266
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,183
Turn back in the future

1267
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Did helping

1268
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Present

1269
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,815
Like there were strategic goals that we were trying to achieve

1270
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Them with the help of

1271
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Say Al-Qaeda back

1272
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,679
They were

1273
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
They turned out terribly

1274
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Fighting

1275
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
Help

1276
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
I'm so it is

1277
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,855
Sword of Justice

1278
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
The rest

1279
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,743
Yeah

1280
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,279
That doesn't make it right

1281
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
Is far more complicated than Alex

1282
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,191
Texas pitching in order

1283
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
American Gothic

1284
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,055
So bizarre.

1285
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
Bill O'Reilly

1286
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
Did sexually harassed

1287
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
And then

1288
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Atlee

1289
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
What

1290
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
This

1291
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,783
Is very weird

1292
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Blankets

1293
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
Such a tangential thought

1294
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
It's it's

1295
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
It's mental illness

1296
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,999
Demonstrative

1297
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,071
It's an inability to track slot A to B to C

1298
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Basically

1299
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,143
There

1300
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
Internal

1301
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Get back

1302
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,287
On the subject

1303
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,199
So-so nenen this is

1304
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,759
Another one of those things that we talked about

1305
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
Is waste

1306
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,111
Later time he gets into an area where

1307
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
He doesn't know quite

1308
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
What's his

1309
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:10,047
What is a narrative

1310
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,095
Yes Alex Jones asked

1311
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:18,495
Themselves that you think you sort of lost track of his persona

1312
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
Those like little spots

1313
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,567
Given that recharge

1314
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,127
O'Reilly

1315
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,663
Because

1316
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
Clip ended with him saying

1317
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Bill O'Reilly

1318
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:34,367
That's kind of up and down on those

1319
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
About that

1320
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
That his listeners if he

1321
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
If he really just said

1322
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,535
Hey

1323
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,327
We don't like Bill O'Reilly

1324
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,119
Because you sexually harasses

1325
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Phoenix

1326
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
He's going to get angry

1327
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,311
Sure sure

1328
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Bill O'Reilly

1329
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,943
Should be allowed to sexually harass people

1330
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
Is just a free-speech issue

1331
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,831
That's what it was really bored

1332
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:11,231
We can make our position very clear

1333
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,047
Hate Bill O'Reilly

1334
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:20,447
For his behavior

1335
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
It's not like some

1336
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,639
Capitalism

1337
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
So

1338
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,247
Is how he can talk about that

1339
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,039
Which allows him to address

1340
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
Supposed to address

1341
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
And then in order to

1342
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,927
Kind of avoid action

1343
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
Position right

1344
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
He switches back into islamophobia

1345
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,351
So I mean if you are taking him

1346
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
I'm assuming.

1347
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
They think

1348
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
He agrees with whatever it is

1349
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
On Bill O'Reilly

1350
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
Nation of it

1351
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,455
You know either it is

1352
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
If either it's mental illness

1353
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
It coming

1354
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Combination of both

1355
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,207
Or it's just a coincidence that he's a lunatic in people believe

1356
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:19,327
I think he's been playing the role of a cornered animal for like 20 years

1357
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143
That's true

1358
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
On the defense

1359
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
Yeah

1360
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Damn

1361
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Now he's back in

1362
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Familiar territory

1363
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,591
So this next clip he explained

1364
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,175
What Bill O'Reilly's biggest mistake was and let me say this

1365
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,783
It's not what you think

1366
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,599
It's not sexual harassment never got it

1367
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
He could at least

1368
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,207
It's not it's not

1369
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:59,007
Bill O'Reilly is biggest mistakes

1370
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:11,295
Completely

1371
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Republican Party

1372
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,823
Absolutely Independent Media

1373
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:38,431
Time for us to address this a little bit

1374
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
We have a

1375
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
Agreement with Alex

1376
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
The most

1377
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
Of the mainstream media's bulshit

1378
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
You know like

1379
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
It's fine

1380
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,207
Believe that and not agree

1381
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:55,839
You're not like I don't think necessarily the tienen does a good job I don't think Fox News does a great job

1382
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
They actually have better

1383
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
Journalistic standards

1384
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,727
So they have a better job blog

1385
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,263
Or Infowars

1386
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
But they aren't like

1387
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
They're not holy

1388
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,919
There's no reason there's no reason to implicitly Trust

1389
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:16,063
Something just because it came out on Sienna and it was with the level of betrayal ved's

1390
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
They have like

1391
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,695
One of the things that I I refuse to

1392
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
2 ever

1393
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
Forgive them for is

1394
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,815
Adjusting themselves

1395
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
To make every

1396
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Sing a horse race

1397
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,471
So many billions of dollars

1398
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
So much time

1399
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Tearing Hillary

1400
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
In order to make

1401
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,919
Get them rated

1402
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,967
Everybody's is closer than you think

1403
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
Who knows who's ahead in the polls this day

1404
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,343
By giving him so much

1405
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Attention because

1406
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,159
He's a he's a great

1407
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Then

1408
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,743
F****** they were apps

1409
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,303
Absolutely complicit in his win total

1410
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,863
F****** cheered for the Iraq War

1411
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,959
They did more to get Trump elected

1412
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,287
Main reason

1413
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,079
Alaska

1414
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:16,479
Even out.

1415
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:21,343
The other the other problem is that a lot of the mainstream media in Alex

1416
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,623
Are we engaged

1417
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
In the game of war profit

1418
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,487
More money off of

1419
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,023
Tricking people into thinking

1420
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
I mean we do think that the world is about to end

1421
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,887
But they also

1422
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,423
Make money off of that

1423
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
We just privately are afraid that that's the case

1424
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,591
We fear for life not enough for bottom

1425
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
So this next clip

1426
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
Shooting what his lawyers

1427
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
Maybe arguing

1428
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,527
Performance artist

1429
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Character

1430
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,367
Probably shouldn't be saying publicly

1431
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
He wants to make the point

1432
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
That he is

1433
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,975
Super f****** real

1434
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,047
And he juxtaposes that to a list

1435
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
Which is delightful

1436
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Goddamn

1437
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
He gets in

1438
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
2

1439
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
A Scanner Darkly

1440
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Play a little bit

1441
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
Because he was

1442
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
He was in that movie

1443
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:17,151
You don't give a shout out to my husband

1444
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,455
Intense thoughts about it they will get to come back

1445
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:40,959
Mendelson author wi British

1446
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
First of all rehab

1447
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
Bizarre slave

1448
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,111
Reprogramming Center

1449
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Not certainly not

1450
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Helping people overcome

1451
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
Genetic

1452
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Addiction

1453
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,767
But

1454
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
I like everyday

1455
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
In trial the

1456
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,423
Could just show the clip that he made that much

1457
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,471
Yeah

1458
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:51,871
Remember trawood

1459
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,919
Washington

1460
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Not

1461
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:01,343
Another day

1462
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,439
The other thing I want to talk about Philip

1463
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
First of all I love

1464
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
Become a big fan of his in the last

1465
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
Few years

1466
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,095
Read a lot of his books

1467
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
It's important to recognize

1468
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
For the speed attic

1469
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,799
He basically wrote these books and almost

1470
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
The Fugue state

1471
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,871
He would just binge on speed

1472
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,175
Because

1473
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
He was married

1474
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
He needed to

1475
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,039
Support his family and he got paid by the word

1476
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,111
So a lot of the stuff you wrote was utter garbage

1477
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Stuff it's really great

1478
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,255
I think there's a parallel

1479
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Alex

1480
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:47,679
Okay but it's probably the super male vitality

1481
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,215
Or brainforce

1482
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,263
These things

1483
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Hood Beats

1484
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,567
Maybe

1485
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,895
Good thing that I want to take issue with

1486
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,735
Is the government drugging people

1487
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,271
These drugs

1488
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,831
Pacifier or whatever

1489
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
Sportage

1490
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
Destroy the

1491
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,207
A Scanner Darkly isn't the vet

1492
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Infants that he could

1493
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,071
Could go with it really shows

1494
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,863
He is a good book and

1495
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,911
The drug aspect of it is really into

1496
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
Interesting

1497
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,775
I would have gone with the three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch

1498
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,079
Which isn't much better book of his

1499
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,871
Of course it has

1500
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,431
Better book that has to do with

1501
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
Drugs

1502
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,015
Basically there are there's a drug

1503
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Choosy

1504
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
That is

1505
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,623
Will people ever want the entire world is on

1506
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
Thomas drug

1507
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
It's because

1508
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,207
Everyone's lives are terrible

1509
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
And that you're able to escape into a Fanta

1510
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,399
SeaWorld drug

1511
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,191
And tries to take over the

1512
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
The game

1513
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,799
Okay

1514
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,591
But

1515
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:04,991
Alex please read the three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch also have gone with that's a salad addiction

1516
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Frank Herbert

1517
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
How do that means better than lkj

1518
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,279
Say it again

1519
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,095
Throughout silkie dicks work that he sort of trying to

1520
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
To deal with his

1521
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,655
Through his narrative

1522
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,191
Like there are a lot of

1523
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
Drugs

1524
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,007
That's why throughout his story isn't

1525
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
Alex is dumb

1526
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:39,295
That's my boy that's when there's someone that I really like and someone who I really

1527
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,367
Is misrepresenting them coming

1528
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Advise on the phone

1529
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,927
Yeah right

1530
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,999
A liquidator

1531
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
Hello

1532
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,071
I like your style

1533
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
Expressions

1534
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:02,079
Gianni's career took off I advised that I'm in 440 seconds

1535
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:02,847
Alright

1536
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,663
No way

1537
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
Advisor on the movie

1538
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
He knows plenty

1539
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,063
Roar

1540
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,719
I know that it sounds like a real

1541
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
Stewart Title but it's one of his biggest book

1542
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,095
I just never heard of

1543
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,119
You're not a PK.

1544
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,703
I'm doubtful you know me

1545
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Anyway

1546
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
This next Club

1547
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,799
We're done with felt

1548
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
I know I know

1549
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
The sadness

1550
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:41,759
Listen your voice I've never lost interest in the rest of the show up there for a minute

1551
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,319
Now I'm just waiting for the brink of love

1552
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:50,719
Actually I forgot

1553
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
Outer space

1554
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Betty White

1555
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,631
This next clip

1556
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,215
Is just more about Bill O'Reilly being a sell-out

1557
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,263
Never sell

1558
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Ever ever

1559
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
Ever

1560
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,871
Lady starts quoting Mark Twain

1561
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:22,719
Orioles bird

1562
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:29,119
Halfway Around the World

1563
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Hawaii

1564
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
Closer than

1565
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Dlisted

1566
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,895
Revel when we talked about originally

1567
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,503
Off the Google search engine

1568
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,807
The fact that he saying now that they

1569
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Closer

1570
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
To what it really

1571
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,583
It was in a day or two he's already changed the narrative on what we're seeing in real time

1572
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
These

1573
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
Just become one of his waypoints

1574
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,215
Is opposed to the main story

1575
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
On the last

1576
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
Episode

1577
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
.

1578
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
10000

1579
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,295
Contractors

1580
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
To download anything

1581
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
Only Google itself

1582
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Can do that

1583
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,767
Is fill out report

1584
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,071
Of what they found on their searches

1585
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
Information is used by Google

1586
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,471
All this stuff

1587
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,031
Downvote

1588
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
It can't be true

1589
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
Can't do that

1590
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,920
It's very bizarre but also

1591
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,712
I have another Mark Twain quote

1592
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:29,696
Alex Jones that was from the outage

1593
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
What is

1594
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
Get your facts first

1595
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
And then you can distort them as much as you please

1596
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,424
Similar

1597
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,824
Skip the first part about getting it the first one

1598
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,872
The world before the truth can get it

1599
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
That's how you have a job

1600
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:56,832
Yeah the only reason you have a job is because Ally is so easy to transfer

1601
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,880
Richard

1602
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
Within that same couple of sentences he gets into the Google stuff

1603
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,376
The same thing you're saying now with Louise Mensch

1604
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
And that's that horrible

1605
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Yeah

1606
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
F****** which

1607
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,240
But she's going on

1608
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Too much

1609
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
The whole other thing

1610
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:24,480
Misusing these quotes

1611
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,272
Is just so Alex

1612
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
It's so Alex at the light

1613
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,368
Bizarre

1614
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Anyway

1615
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
Any fact that most of those up

1616
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
Reply to him

1617
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
Direct

1618
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,120
Sitting here like Athena

1619
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
Whispering

1620
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,520
Thanks

1621
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Excellent

1622
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,896
Alex Jones

1623
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
Winston Churchill

1624
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:57,760
Bill O'Reilly

1625
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,552
Sometime it doesn't go far enough

1626
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,344
It's very bizarre so here we go

1627
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:27,968
Never Surrender

1628
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
Those goals are pretty good but also I think it was more of them

1629
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Michael Caine impression

1630
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,352
Wasn't

1631
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,424
If all Alex was about was defending art

1632
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,472
In literature and defending

1633
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,056
Repression of religion

1634
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:59,712
I'm pretty sure that's what he does I would I would not have a problem with it earlier in the episode

1635
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,440
Skull covered in

1636
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
Million dollars

1637
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,360
The more you want that I just want to

1638
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Gross

1639
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
Just want to touch it one

1640
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:34,784
Okay

1641
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,344
Demon covered diamonds

1642
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,672
Letsjerk

1643
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:45,792
Based on your goals

1644
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,632
I'm not going to not touch it if somebody brings the disease.

1645
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,424
Progressive near me

1646
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
Okay so in the neck

1647
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
Calendar year I'm going

1648
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,800
To strive to live

1649
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,848
Embodying Sasha Banks theme song

1650
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:02,432
Are you going to find a diamond encrusted

1651
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:06,016
Try and touch the sculpture

1652
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,344
We have very different colors

1653
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
He's going to get into Bel Air

1654
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
He's getting back

1655
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:31,872
Call Billy

1656
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:40,320
Thug

1657
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,416
Seems to be what this is more about

1658
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,048
He doesn't give a f*** actually was harming women

1659
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:55,168
He was creating a threatening and hostile work environment for these women's based

1660
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,216
Denver women that he wanted

1661
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,008
Dafuq

1662
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:03,872
Bill O'Reilly

1663
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
He played that clip

1664
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
Anything to do

1665
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,440
Celia or online Predators or anything like that

1666
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,232
What a

1667
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,536
Well admittedly Bella Riley

1668
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Isabel

1669
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,400
He is a thug sure I don't know what that means in this context

1670
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:31,520
I don't know but you know it's Rachel.

1671
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
Actually believe

1672
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Bill O'Reilly

1673
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
In the term of like

1674
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,688
Hired Hand

1675
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,272
Organized crime

1676
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:47,648
Then

1677
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
Racketeering

1678
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
What is Utah

1679
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
Alex's

1680
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,912
About Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly

1681
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,984
Great we get to we get to the

1682
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:08,384
Trifecta of monstrous right-wing propaganda

1683
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Talking about Rush

1684
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,968
But

1685
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
Snopes

1686
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,296
Horrifying monster Rush Limbaugh

1687
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,368
Parents against

1688
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,928
Rush Limbaugh

1689
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,232
The man who finally made me

1690
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
Acknowledge that

1691
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
My parents

1692
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,632
Easily influenced by the scaremongering old ugly

1693
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,936
Yeah I do mean ugly

1694
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
I bought it

1695
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,544
As the sole

1696
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,824
Of Rush Limbaugh

1697
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,176
Will take some solace in knowing that in this Cliff Alex

1698
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,968
Going to talk him out pretty good

1699
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
Lincoln Lawyer bunch about the

1700
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Audience

1701
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:37,216
Kenmore Liquors in Hueytown

1702
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
Who's the biggest

1703
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,424
No you're under attack in the media because you're engaged in a very ugly custody battle that it proven YouTube

1704
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
But

1705
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,008
Rush Limbaugh

1706
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
Has 30

1707
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,080
18.5 million weekly

1708
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,616
To his show

1709
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,688
And that is not the number one show on terrestrial radio

1710
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,016
NPR Morning Edition

1711
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,576
Considered both have over 14 million listeners

1712
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Every week

1713
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,904
The right after that

1714
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
Is Sean Hannity

1715
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
5 million a week

1716
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,536
He brought up George Noory that's Coast to Coast

1717
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,352
That's only 2.75 million a week

1718
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,168
Numbers are f****** stupid and way off

1719
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,728
Savage Nation is down there at 5.2

1720
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
25 million

1721
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:46,336
That's beat by Glenn Beck he didn't want to bring that up

1722
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,128
Egypt different numbers

1723
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,968
Do you think the people who cares why here's my guess

1724
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,760
That's a great question

1725
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
Is

1726
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,088
There are underlings

1727
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
And they just

1728
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
Like they just give him a

1729
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
Spreadsheet

1730
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,304
With A-1 and then a lot of zeros after it

1731
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,072
Say this is how many

1732
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
Listening

1733
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,144
Congratulations

1734
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Possibly

1735
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
Possibly

1736
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
I found out

1737
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
Statistics amor

1738
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,616
Cuz I wanted to know more

1739
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
Pacific's

1740
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,176
Some things that I'm not thrilled

1741
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
Oh no

1742
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,736
One of the things I learned

1743
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Is that

1744
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,064
Percentage-wise of his audience

1745
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
Chicago is the biggest

1746
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,720
Best city in the world 1.22% of his audience

1747
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Chicago

1748
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
Into you

1749
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,448
Only person

1750
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,216
I'm listening

1751
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,056
That might be what these cats are

1752
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,592
I might be skewered

1753
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,896
It's you and then you have

1754
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
Registration

1755
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,784
So it's those two

1756
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
It might be at

1757
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,160
An interesting Issaquah cast has a

1758
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
Affinity

1759
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,792
Explanation

1760
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:17,472
This is a comparison of the audience composition of this property in this case property means infowars.com

1761
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,264
Or audience segments

1762
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,360
Composition of Infowars

1763
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,408
5 to the internet

1764
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Population

1765
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,200
At Large

1766
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
The higher the Affinity number is

1767
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,064
The more concentrated

1768
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
Are particular geographic area

1769
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,280
Multiplier of time

1770
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:46,144
For San Francisco that means that given visitor is 10 times more likely to be from

1771
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,960
Francisco has any internet user chosen at random

1772
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Okay

1773
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:55,616
An affinity of 5 *

1774
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,920
So I looked at the statistics

1775
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,224
I want something

1776
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,504
Cousin

1777
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
State

1778
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,344
The Affinity ranking is 1.98

1779
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,208
Twice as likely as a random internet user to Via United

1780
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
That makes

1781
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
You know it doesn't

1782
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:17,632
Make sense America is not the top

1783
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,680
Who is the top one

1784
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,216
Number two

1785
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
The Cayman Islands

1786
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
3 *

1787
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Affinity rate

1788
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,104
I

1789
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Don't

1790
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Understand

1791
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,456
I don't either I don't know where the Cayman Island

1792
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
Car payment

1793
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,784
The not very big

1794
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,064
Right area

1795
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,416
What's important I think

1796
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,952
Then

1797
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,536
It's a tax shelter

1798
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
So maybe

1799
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,936
No

1800
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Ears

1801
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,984
Number one

1802
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Syria

1803
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
No s***

1804
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Syria has an eight

1805
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,896
.5 time

1806
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
I'm guessing.

1807
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,040
Probably more recent

1808
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
It's just

1809
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
The current

1810
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,464
I'm not sure what time frame is covered

1811
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
Syria is then

1812
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,560
Like

1813
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,096
Reading those counter-narrative

1814
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
That's what's going on with that

1815
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
Because he

1816
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,216
I'm guessing they read all of the

1817
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,496
Syria wasn't really

1818
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Responsible

1819
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
For all of this

1820
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:34,688
More likely to watch

1821
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Another

1822
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:42,624
I'm not going to say that Syria is just all Rubble everywhere

1823
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,184
To Reliable internet

1824
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
And or maybe reading

1825
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
News

1826
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
On the internet are not necessarily

1827
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:53,632
Do random civilians

1828
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
Those are the people who are

1829
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,752
That could just be a sod

1830
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:03,104
Just like I am Chicago that could all be him

1831
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,480
Cayman Islands

1832
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:13,856
But if you look at the numbers

1833
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
People

1834
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
We were listening

1835
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
In Syria it's not very high

1836
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,512
Considerate

1837
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,304
Compared to other

1838
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Yet their Affinity rate

1839
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
Being used for this

1840
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,032
Because that seems to imply that

1841
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
People like it

1842
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:39,456
Yeah but that's it you're much more likely then.

1843
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
Sitting that website

1844
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:45,856
To my life pretty consistently that I don't like

1845
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
The hatred

1846
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
Funny

1847
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,440
Fair enough

1848
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,000
Super Bazaar also I checked

1849
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,024
Ratings

1850
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Traffic news website

1851
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,864
In the last week has gone up at all

1852
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,656
So the even disc

1853
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:02,496
Stuff isn't really doing

1854
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,336
We're just reading other people's tweets

1855
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,920
Yeah well and I would assume that really at

1856
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
It kind of feels like he is reach

1857
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,016
His saturation

1858
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:16,064
Like he's got everybody here

1859
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
He's going to get

1860
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,160
That's what his audience is

1861
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
The people that

1862
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,488
The people that are going to be there for

1863
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,560
And he's not going to gain or lose

1864
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
He's just right

1865
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,632
Point where everybody

1866
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,680
Would be listening to Alex Jones

1867
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,216
Is listening to Alex

1868
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:38,848
Also I just checked our Twitter we got a hot tip for our next episode check out that thing

1869
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Thanks for the

1870
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,944
Thanks for the heads up we'll see if it's we're going to do James

01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,808
Cuidados live because maybe were record

1873
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
We were going to get to work

1874
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,208
And for the rest of this week

1875
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,512
He's recording from his car

1876
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
And what have you

1877
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,584
Still a f***

1878
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
Looking businessman

1879
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,168
Driving

1880
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,496
Need a drink

1881
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,264
Okay

1882
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,104
Picture of Alec

1883
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
On screen

1884
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Wow you

1885
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,920
This audio play it

1886
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
Man dude

1887
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
Yeah

Easter sale still on

1889
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:27,744
Still on

1890
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,048
Easter sale for Lent

1891
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:36,704
Tomorrow it won't be tomorrow

1892
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,008
It's this thing called fear of loss of game

1893
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,968
We're going to put that these are selling

1894
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
Fastly

1895
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,504
Wouldn't

1896
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,784
Handle

1897
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,808
They're just selling to

1898
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,832
Do fast we've got to put a

1899
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,648
Set a timer on the hour

1900
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
The 2nd

1901
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,464
Artificial scarcity

1902
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,792
Yes that is we're going to run out of this thing and you're not going to be able to get it

1903
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
That motivate

1904
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,096
Some people who are afraid

1905
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
They're not going to get the sea

1906
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,960
Is what people have

1907
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,776
That's like all the sale is going to stop

1908
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Atmore

1909
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
I am

1910
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,688
You know you come to realize that's sale never ends

1911
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
It's always

1912
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,760
But if you pretend you're going to end it

1913
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,320
People don't call you on it

1914
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
Wee-Man

1915
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,392
I mean

1916
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,744
Kohl's the store with a bar here in Chicago

1917
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,048
Why are they

1918
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
Probably I would hope so

1919
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,728
No it's let you go and you go into a

1920
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,032
Clothing stores like hey these are 50

1921
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
Percent off

1922
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,248
Constantly going out of business

1923
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:57,344
The mattress store that's over by the Target here in Chicago has been going out of business

1924
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
6 years

1925
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,696
Yeah

1926
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
Stamps

1927
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,024
The scam

1928
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Alex

1929
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
In the first clip

1930
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,584
He's doing his plug

1931
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,144
I would describe this is Victor

1932
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,704
Victim

1933
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:19,872
Infowars.com

1934
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,376
OK Google

1935
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:06,976
Royale

1936
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Cut off.

1937
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,168
But there's also like

1938
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,472
Because O'Reilly got his

1939
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,544
Advertisers pulled because they had a crisis of conscience

1940
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:26,688
Support someone who is a sexual harasser in a stereo

1941
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,576
Prompto the crisis of conscience

1942
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,624
Play some Ciara.

1943
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,488
Being like they're pulling our sponsors

1944
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
Is like

1945
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:46,656
Are you saying you committed a crime

1946
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
It's happening

1947
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
You're Alex you got it

1948
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,752
You got a drool taken away

1949
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
Because you violated their terms

1950
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
The service

1951
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,872
That's not a crime what he's

1952
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
This is happening

1953
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Because

1954
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,944
A lot of s***

1955
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Has gone specs

1956
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
Tacular libads

1957
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
Totally

1958
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,112
It is

1959
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,208
Florida that's connected to him being a propagandist liar

1960
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,512
Well I don't think I don't think

1961
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:15,072
I don't think as much of that bad stuff is

1962
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
It's all connected to

1963
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,888
Mistakes he's made

1964
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,656
For twenty years

1965
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,472
It's the chickens Roost

1966
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,264
Has word come home

1967
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
It is connected

1968
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
To his custom

1969
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,176
The hearing which isn't connected to

1970
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:32,992
Google

1971
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,040
Accurately recognizing

1972
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,600
Constantly debunked

1973
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:41,184
And so.

1974
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,208
Currently recognizing

1975
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,000
Debunked

1976
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,072
Which is connected to the globalist

1977
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,376
Exactly

1978
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,680
If you want to say you have journalistic integrity

1979
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,216
Fire Jerome corsi

1980
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,032
That guy is the worst

1981
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,920
I don't that's Rapaport

1982
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,992
Tell Rappaport to hang up a Transit

1983
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,528
You know the guy

1984
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,832
Also I actually want to do

1985
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,136
If there was

1986
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
Skype interview

1987
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
Where Alex is just like

1988
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:22,912
Hey this is a professional operation

1989
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
You look like shity song

1990
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
II

1991
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,752
I want to do

1992
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,824
An episode sometime in the future about how

1993
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
It's become very

1994
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Clear to me

1995
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,432
That John Rapaport when he does his reports is

1996
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:37,248
Is using sort of a hypnotic suggestion

1997
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Techniques

1998
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,088
He's using the way he speaks is very

1999
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
Intentionally bike

2000
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Hypnotic

2001
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,696
I've noticed a couple things that he does

2002
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,720
That are like

2003
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,024
Is not a mistake you're doing this on purpose

2004
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
Are people aren't paying attention

2005
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
It would be very easy

2006
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,632
Need to get lulled into like a

2007
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,912
Oh yeah

2008
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,960
Becoming

2009
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,264
I also want to do a special report about how

2010
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,544
I realized

2011
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,592
The Alex Jones's career

2012
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,152
Very closely mirrors that of the rap

2013
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
A group of Jedi Mind

2014
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:13,856
I've got these in the world

2015
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
And if you'd like

2016
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,184
Come to fruition

2017
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:23,584
We're in the middle of his login

2018
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,120
I don't know

2019
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,192
Your your birthday

Pennywise

2022
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:34,592
Just like The Purge over it

2023
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:39,712
Once again all visits to our website

2024
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
I would also like to say

2025
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,832
Easter sale that he was promoting like his commercial was like

2026
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,856
I am going to

2027
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,976

Yeah nothing

2030
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,888
Nothing says celebrating the Christian holiday

2031
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,424
Blatant capital

2032
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,728
Yeah but I think he was a

2033
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,264
Expecting people to get mad

2034
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,056
Or something like that

2035
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,360
Starbucks

2036
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:15,296
Expected for War on Christmas coming out of it

01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216
Bishop

2101
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Is amazing

2102
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,312
My impression of his lawyer how I think it went

2103
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:01,760
Trying to just avoid the question I imagine

2104
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:07,136
Don't do it

2105
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
It would have been awesome to

2106
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:16,352
To find out that his lawyer was in the car with him the whole time

2107
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,888
Knockouts

2108
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:24,288
Anyways we got to get to the court or the flip side

2109
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,104
The ingredients

2110
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,128
And knockout

2111
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
No difference

2112
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,272
Troubles

2113
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
Explored a lot of product

2114
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,648
F****** Walgreens have you tried

2115
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,208
I haven't cuz I'll never give him any money

2116
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,280
It has no different ingredients really than most

2117
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
Over-the-counter

2118
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,352
Herbal

2119
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
Remedies

2120
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,912
And

2121
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,704
They're not 50.

2122
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,752
What are they

2123
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,800
They're about

2124
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
Maybe time

2125
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,848
About the same

2126
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,736
Is $30

2127
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,368
Nothing is actually Morris

2128
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
Source

2129
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,560
These himself

2130
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,864
He had the brilliant idea

2131
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,656
What if

2132
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
Threw a bunch of s***

2133
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,496
Is it a pill

2134
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,776
Okay

2135
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,056
So what if

2136
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:32,384
My bone broth what if I grind up a bunch of bone broth

2137
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,688
And put it into a pill

2138
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:37,760
Sure

2139
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,808
Now I got to work with people too

2140
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,344
Find all of these ingredients

2141
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
Right

2142
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,464
Spells

2143
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,120
Put different you know he's already talked to the fact that his super Bluetooth

2144
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,168
Just Tom's of Maine toothpaste with a couple of greedy

2145
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,640
Stuff so I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if

2146
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
Some

2147
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,944
You know Nature's Best

2148
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,600
Eric brand

2149
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,368
Like

2150
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:18,208
NyQuil

2151
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,048
It just doesn't have the

2152
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
The same

2153
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,656
Yeah exactly Dawson has like some of these

2154
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,192
Slavery

2155
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,520
It is insane.

2156
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,056
Placebo effect

2157
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
The point where you

2158
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,408
Work better

2159
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,712
Happens to me every time in the store

2160
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:46,112
Every single time like I'm not getting

2161
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,928
This is obvious

2162
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,208
Human brain

2163
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,256
Mentally stupid

2164
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,048
That's what we're learning

2165
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
Altro

2166
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,168
And it gets well

2167
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,192
He's turned off

2168
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:06,336
I don't know why he had to make sure that this video

2169
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,920
Are elected audio-video as long as his Drive

2170
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,456
I don't know why that's okay

2171
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,528
The long drive

2172
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:16,832
Yeah so you know his Drive is over

2173
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,856
He's gotten to court

2174
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:18,880
And

2175
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
Dismount

2176
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,256
Is clunky

2177
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,816
Very.

2178
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:36,032
Call

2179
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:39,872
Thunder

2180
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:53,696
Nachos

2181
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,128
Great job

2182
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,464
So that's the end of it

2183
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,024
If you go by the end of Revelation

2184
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,560
He technically just blasphemy

2185
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,728
The final commandment at the end of Revelation 2

2186
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,032
You can't add anything or take away anything

2187
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,080
Sing from the Bible

2188
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,104
Committed a great heresy

2189
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
Which is

2190
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:47,200
Cool I mean that's what you'd want to do if you were building a system

2191
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,504
Nothing else

2192
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
So

2193
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,320
5 paraphrasing

2194
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
The Bible like that

2195
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,368
2

2196
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,136
Sort of

2197
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:58,464
He's exploiting it in order to build up his own persecution

2198
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,000
He's just added

2199
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,304
Context to the Bible

2200
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,328
That's it like that.

2201
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
Absolutely

2202
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:07,680
Yeah

2203
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,568
We have the Bible is problematic

2204
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:17,152
Roast

2205
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
Define versus

2206
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
The stuff in it

2207
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,832
At the end

2208
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,392
I love you all I look

2209
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,952
Forgot

2210
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:32,512
Yeah I remember that for my church days

2211
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:34,560
I definitely remember people saying that

2212
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
Metaphorical

2213
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
A metaphor

2214
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,448
Like a rock face of the cliff

2215
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,032
It's a good face

2216
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,824
Dammit I still haven't seen the fasting

2217
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,104
Furious

2218
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:51,456
Let's go now now

2219
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:57,856
And I want to take a moment to reflect a tiny bit I really don't think that we got a concise

2220
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
Assessment

2221
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:07,584
I really don't think that he made any point other than to muddy the waters and save it what this really is about is the

2222
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,120
The globalists trying to take him down

2223
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:11,424
Yeah but he

2224
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,496
He got the opportunity to

2225
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:17,312
Puffs his chest out at Bill O'Reilly

2226
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,848
Talk to my

2227
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,408
And there's also a little bit of

2228
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,808
Patty like a Bill O'Reilly baby

2229
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:31,648
Stickin around

2230
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,440
Do you know what you're famous for

2231
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,976
One Clip where you said

2232
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:39,072
The f word. Bill O'Reilly

2233
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,376
Don't disagree with Alex entirely on that

2234
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:46,752
Gets to throw in some islamophobia witch

2235
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:51,872
Stock and trade

2236
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,920
Especially now that

2237
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:56,480
We're seeing all of these tensions arise

2238
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,016
With people who aren't Islamic

2239
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:03,136
He has to get that narrative

2240
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Distract away from

2241
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:08,512
And then what you said some full-on bulshit there

2242
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,048
Megyn Kelly

2243
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,072
Kelly

2244
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,120
Superman Kelly leave Megyn Kelly alone

2245
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:19,520
Leave her alone do a Chris Crocker Style video crying

2246
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:23,872
It right there she created knockout absolutely

2247
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,664
Get to die

2248
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,944
It was my idea

2249
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:33,344
My dear was throw bunch of s*** together whataboutism with liberals

2250
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,136
Pedophiles

2251
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,952
Conversation we are always under

2252
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:38,976
But

2253
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
Throughout it all

2254
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,304
Most

2255
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:45,120
Is he has a full-on understanding Phillips

2256
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,216
But he is a f******

2257
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:49,984
Policy wonk

2258
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,032
He's really getting down to the

2259
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,568
Like the substance

2260
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,104
Of what's going on here

2261
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:58,176
Like he's really in the Weeds about this Bill O'Reilly

2262
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
He's got a

2263
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,272
He has which one

2264
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,088
Bill O'Reilly the Frog

2265
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:08,672
There you go

2266
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,488
Fine Nails 15 minutes

2267
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:13,792
Coulda said that

2268
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,864
Sucks anyways

2269
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,912
Pjw instead in the studio

2270
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:23,776
You Alex good luck in court this week Alex

2271
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
I know it's a

2272
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,080
It's going to be all week

2273
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,872
I'm not looking forward to seeing hot take

2274
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,944
Nobody reminded me

2275
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,504
F****** tweeting at me all these updates

2276
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,808
No I'm watching I see all of it

2277
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,928
Like I said

2278
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,720
It is this fine line we walk

2279
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,000
I sincerely hope that

2280
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,304
Well

2281
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,352
The way

2282
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,936
Any custody battle with whatever's best for the f***

2283
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,728
Kids which apparently nobody

2284
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:58,336
Lettuce

2285
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:03,968
Thought the knowledge fight with a couple of new pieces up there

2286
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,904
A new entry in the Life I'll be in the Alex Jones biography

2287
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,696
