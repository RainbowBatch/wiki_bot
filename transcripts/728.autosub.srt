3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936

It is

11
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616

00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,456
Trying to find entertainment to watch well abma kebatan to

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Buttons out

14
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
And I've walked

15
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
A few online

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
YouTube videos that are

17
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
They're basically people explaining

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Hoax games

19
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
Quick interactive alternative reality games

20
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,656
Okay I can't okay. Going to say what you say

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
YouTube videos up at f

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Clues and you got a crack

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Okay okay alright but they're like used as like narrative storytelling internet

24
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Scavenger hunt

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,992
Stories but sometimes they have their like horror stories

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
I don't know I would never want to do one of these things

27
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Or be involved in a lick

28
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
Be one of the people crying

29
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Crack the puzzles

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
The man listening to

31
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
People just

32
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Like Bass

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
Basically pretend that an art project is real

34
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Kind of fun

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
I enjoyed

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
So

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
It is is it the like unfettered just

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Willingness to commit

39
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
To this world or are you just like

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
I just like

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Any any

42
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,760
Enthusiasm

43
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Yeah absolutely

44
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
My bright spot

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
What is what I'll tell you this

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
Do remember how I ABC and HBO and Warner and all that stuff there's all of that merge

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Stop.

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
So ATC Owingsville

49
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
The challenge

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Be real world real world

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Not called that

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Write out so they put out a season and is filled with like ABC reality stars you know those types of people

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
And they were

54
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
You know

55
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,576
But but then my my partner found a season from the old days

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
That we had watched before

57
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Man

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,768
I don't know you need some kind of Dirtbag element to that show you mean dirtbag

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
Who says Dirtbag about

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
That's the only reason that any of those he's got to have that we're watchable at all know it's not a competition

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Dirtbag

62
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
And it's so unethical

63
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Because it's just like

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,504
Give them all the alcohol and hope the Dirtbag goes crazy

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
Is the fundamentally unethical but at the same time like

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
If your Continuum is

67
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
What my Continuum is the Great British Bake Off at the challenge

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,328
It's like any all of the reality competition shows fall in between those two poles

69
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
That's Scottish lady with a dirtbag

70
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Talk to you in a few of the Great British Bake Off

71
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
I don't say that about Liam

72
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
They're called hollywoodism

73
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Someone who is not a dirtbag

74
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Thank you I guess

75
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Joining us

76
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,600
Returning to the podcast were very excited to have her along to give some

77
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Insight

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Into things on the ground

79
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
At The Alex Jones trial

80
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Connecticut

81
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Elizabeth Williams

82
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
It's Williams son and thank you for not calling

83
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,615
It wasn't wow

84
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,527
Legitimately we've known you for years you know what happened there is I was in my head arguing

85
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
About whether or not I was going to say

86
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
The New York Times or Brianna.

87
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Can I drop the Sun

88
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,767
I can't believe it said of the New York Times Sun

89
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Yeah probably

90
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
I have to put it somewhere that does please accept my apologies and what is your brakes by

91
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Absolutely

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
Here I was thinking

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
So okay

94
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
My bright spot

95
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
Because I've been all day at the Alex Jones damages trial

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
At the end of the day

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
A in a truly by

98
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Brightspot

99
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
The sun came out

100
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
After raining all day

101
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
At the end of The Garden Court

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
And

103
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Someone convinced

104
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Alex Jones that there was a security threat

105
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,543
And so if they prevented him from having a press conference after his mouth

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,127
Countdown in court ohwow

107
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Somebody

108
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
Somebody trolled him into

109
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Being an a******

110
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Exactly and I have a have a Siri now I know I shouldn't you know because we're talkin about

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
Jessie theories I know I shouldn't do this but

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
I did hear two bailiffs Talkin at the end of the hall after he left

113
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
Andre said well

114
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Something like

115
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
That works

116
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Something like

117
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
He can't shut his mouth

118
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
There's a number of things that we experienced he recording this on Thursday there's a number of things that you could probably be like well.

119
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
That worked

120
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,767
The day of that work

121
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Maybe their phone

122
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Or something like that

123
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
But it was you no right after

124
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,055
After he got onto the elevator and he kept saying they're telling me it's a security issue

125
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
I think the only conclusion

126
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
We can take from this is that the bailiff

127
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
Are under the employee of Klaus Schwab

128
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
They are talking about the trial as a whole

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Considering they are part of the global

130
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Which we have to assume at this point

131
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Even more funny is that he would believe that

132
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Because

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
When you went outside the courthouse

134
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
There was maybe

135
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
One guy

136
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
With a

137
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Microphone

138
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
A couple of

139
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
You know

140
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Reputable News truck

141
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
And really no one else Tumbleweed going good

142
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,463
Accounting for it how many rooms were there around

143
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
Yeah yeah yeah

144
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,655
Equalizer discount rooftop band

145
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
If you are a

146
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
Disreputable assassin blood say

147
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
Why wouldn't you was trying to

148
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,199
Supposed with a reputable news organization

149
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
You camouflage

150
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
It makes total sense for Alex to believe that because it's

151
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
It plays into his like

152
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Importance

153
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Absolutely

154
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Yeah yeah

155
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
You can trick people couldn't be bothered

156
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Turn up just a

157
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Support them in court I'm not sure they could be bothered to

158
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Turn up to

159
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
Do whatever he was afraid they might do so

160
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Yeah

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
A question that I was meaning to ask you

162
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
Elizabeth not there

163
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
I was wondering

164
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
About those press

165
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
Cuz because I like not to

166
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Poison the answer

167
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
But I find them really really gross

168
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
How do you feel about

169
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
The fact that like no matter what

170
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
You do like you could

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Choose not to

172
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Duke one of those

173
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
There will be other

174
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
News organization

175
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
They're right

176
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
No matter what you do

177
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
So you might as well be there

178
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
But like how do you feel about the actual event

179
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
That happened

180
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Filthy

181
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
Yeah no I

182
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
I have I actually had this very conversation with

183
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Another journalist

184
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
I'm in the elevator

185
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Deciding not

186
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
You do one of his press conferences

187
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Because the other thing

188
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Here we did one yesterday where

189
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
He did at the lunch

190
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
Break but he was late showing up and so by the time he started

191
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Talkin

192
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
It was almost time for court to begin again

193
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
And so there you're really faced with you.

194
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
The thing that you're

195
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
Absolutely talking about Jordan witches

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Do I go into the courtroom and listen to the Sandy Hook families tell their story or do I

197
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
I said here

198
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Outside

199
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Stand here and just listened to

200
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
This word

201
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Salad immuno

202
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Repetition

203
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
We've all heard it before thousands of times you know do we just

204
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Listen to Alec

205
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Alex Jones bloviate

206
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,271
You do deliver what he usually delivers or do you go inside and actually

207
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
You know rejoin the real world

208
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
Yeah so what are the things that I think is really tough about that

209
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Pat said that choice therealak

210
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
How to put everyone in by showing up late

211
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
And having a press conference is that

212
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Press conference

213
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Itself is a disrespect

214
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Text to the what's going on in Fort

215
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
And then it's forcing people to make this choice

216
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Between Lake

217
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Watching him disrespect

218
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
The court or go into the court

219
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
I know that we were watching it and

220
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Airline crime stream

221
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Was showing

222
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
The Alex outside

223
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
If you got a minute left right what are they going to do are they going to cut away from him to go in

224
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
All right it's just one guy

225
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
And yeah and

226
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Thanks Dan because I was going to make that

227
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
204 room service came of course

228
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
The mats that

229
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
You don't fit this whole thing is

230
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
This is

231
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,615
Does Neil heslin put it in Austin at the trial you attended

232
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
It is an act of

233
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Cowardice

234
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
That Alec

235
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Jones does not show up

236
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551
The courtroom for his own trial

237
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
Unless he is compelled to because he has to test

238
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
So this trial has been

239
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Been going on now for nearly two weeks

240
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
And

241
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
This is the first day he has shown up

242
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
But he's been in town for a couple

243
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
Couple of days and he's have these press conferences out in front

244
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
And even when he's not in town he's watch

245
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Watching everyday on his show and he is near

246
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Maligning the process

247
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
The judge the proceedings

248
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,271
And setting up a website as they said in court today

249
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Kangaroo Court where his viewers

250
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Can watch

251
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
And donate

252
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
To his legal defense so

253
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
You know it just is

254
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
After the last

255
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Trial

256
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
One of the jurors that was shared with me

257
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Said that his

258
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Failure to turn up

259
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
And the fact that

260
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
He was tearing apart

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
The entire process on his show

262
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Really pissed off

263
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Because it

264
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Said that

265
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
He has other contempt

266
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
4

267
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Did you just show processing this country and that's

268
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Really what

269
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Where is today right

270
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Compelling case for why you got

271
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
Default that behavior

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
I need to get that confirmation

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
From you just because

274
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
It's like

275
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
While I was watching the trial in Austin

276
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
I'm sitting in the courtroom looking at the Jersey no kind of

277
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,103
Getting an idea of how it is they were feeling you know there is there good Poker Face

278
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,991
But I do know there were some of those moments like that the one that will always remember is

279
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
The guy who is writing notes

280
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
For the first

281
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Our two of Alex's test

282
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Tamari

283
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Putting his notepad down

284
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
You know what there's no

285
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Keep doing that I get it

286
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
It's nice to know that that

287
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
He's

288
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,959
Specto behavior that they account for because that there is a part of me that's like

289
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,103
I don't know if they would care about that so much that these are people who are taking time out of their lives

290
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
Old was civic duty

291
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
And it probably would be an affront to

292
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
To the sacrifice that they're make

293
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Race

294
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,999
Exactly rather than collecting my heater per diem and Dad

295
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
No I am as you recall

296
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
In off

297
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Austin he was maligning the jury themselves

298
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
Right he was calling them you basically death

299
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
Blue-collar Folk

300
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
They don't know any blue-collar folk who love

301
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
That's what I'm going to insult them

302
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
I will I will say one

303
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,623
Something about his press conferences out front was I was actually on the phone with you Elizabeth

304
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
The story about his bankruptcy

305
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Record and

306
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
Just hear him in the background starting to talk

307
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,519
And we rushed off the phone and on the stream I saw you walk behind

308
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
That was kind

309
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,735
Great bankruptcy content that was what I was in

310
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Search up

311
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
I got a little bit I thought

312
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Right I mean

313
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
He did touch on that to you did get a little bit of the banker

314
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
He he he recast you know what was really a

315
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Pretty devil

316
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Stating hearing for him earlier this week

317
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
That's exactly

318
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
A bankruptcy judge in Texas

319
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
To remove

320
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
My lawyer and Mike

321
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Infrastructure in office

322
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Officer

323
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Because

324
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
That means we'll get additional oversight over Free Speech systems that we just so dearly need

325
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
Someone who is completely honest Billy unlike the lawyer and the chief restructuring officer Who We Are

326
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,887
Someone who is completely unrelated to free speech systems imagine that

327
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Yeah he is

328
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
You've got to be thrilled like

329
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
Exactly what he wanted before a bankruptcy judge

330
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
You say

331
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Something along the lines of I hope I never have to

332
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
To do something like this in my career again

333
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
But they dropped

334
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
The Gallows

335
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
F****** talking about I hope I never have to

336
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Is there a bankruptcy

337
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
City Court Judge get the f*** out of here

338
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
Sorrow not anger

339
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
There is

340
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Are beyond your parents

341
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Being disappointed not angry

342
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Saro nothing

343
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,055
I am so disappointed at this bankruptcy filing

344
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,943
I'd say maybe there is something to this for the for fries which system is because based on

345
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
Pause and Alex's testimony

346
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
I don't know if anybody knows how that business actually works or where money comes from or you're being so nice

347
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,303
Somebody to finally know what that actually going on

348
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Strategic unawareness

349
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
But might be

350
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,983
What kind of what kind of two words are those to put next to each other

351
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Absurd

352
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,639
The thing that I also liked another sort of meta aspect of this whole thing is

353
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
So

354
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
One of the things that the bankruptcy

355
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
He judge raised as a lack of

356
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Candor

357
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Transparency and a quest

358
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Questionable

359
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Business expense

360
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
Personal expense actually by Jones was the $80,000

361
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
That he pulled out of

362
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
The company to finance his trip

363
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Cheer

364
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
In Connecticut

365
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,335
Where he has a Cadre of bodyguards

366
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Jake Sutton Court today that

367
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
He took a chartered jet

368
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
To Waterbury Connecticut

369
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
And

370
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Browser

371
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Sweden

372
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
SUVs under staying at

373
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
Free Posh Airbnb

374
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
A short distance from the courthouse so

375
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
It doesn't seem like

376
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Bankrupt

377
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Behavior

378
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Wasn't the 80,000 just

379
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,727
Just for security wasn't just like security detail

380
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Yeah that's what

381
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,359
That's what the judge said in the bankruptcy case

382
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
Is it that they took out even more

383
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Honestly

384
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
His his nitpicking

385
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Response

386
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
About the jet

387
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
With so much

388
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
What Alex

389
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Is to me is like

390
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
The same time as he's supposed to be like

391
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Defending himself

392
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
He can't help

393
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
It'll be like the first time we ever charted a jet

394
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
You know when you're like

395
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
What are you f******

396
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
You do it you would same Madman

397
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
You said that

398
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,335
He never chartered Jets

399
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,431
Before 2018

400
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
RaceTrac

401
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Amorous

402
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Security problems

403
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,855
In other words I don't want to be hassled in an airport

404
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
They don't have Security in airports

405
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
You know or I think if there's a a second

406
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Interpretation is at

407
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Before all this I couldn't

408
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Afford one

409
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
What you mean

410
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Morgz

411
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
The point

412
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Such a difference Europa

413
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
How is it been on the ground they're like

414
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Comparative Lee we talked to the Sebastian our last

415
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Episode

416
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
And

417
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
We got kind of a sense of his feeling but

418
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Premier Premier

419
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
Comparing the house Things Are

420
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Feeling them

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
The Vibes in Austin versus

422
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Does Connecticut

423
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
What are some of the big

424
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Takeaways that you're noticing

425
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
It is

426
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Cooler

427
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Cher

428
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Giving temperature

429
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
5 degrees in Jordan now

430
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
Sweating through his shirt right next

431
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
Estimated endorse me feel

432
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Thanks

433
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
There are there

434
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
There's no

435
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Voodoo Donuts

436
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
It's

437
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
It's not a it's not a special

438
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Cuz you guys aren't there

439
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
We really liven up a city

440
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:26,079
Which exactly why it's a good thing we're not there I think I think the problem is

441
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
We liven up

442
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
Trial not a thing you want livened up

443
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
That was

444
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
The Lively stay

445
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
I you know is a little different

446
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
It's

447
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
It moves more slowly

448
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
I think

449
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,631
Partly because there are so many places in the case you know this is the

450
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
These are the

451
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
The families of eight Sandy Hooks

452
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
FBI agent who is implicated in these

453
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,383
I'm in Jones's bogus

454
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
Conspiracy theorist

455
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,039
Mysterious forgetting that the FBI themselves are shadow plaintiffs

456
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
Oh yes

457
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Yes what did he said

458
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
This is kind of a deep State deal

459
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
Sing yes

460
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,583
Jesse's going to live on in infamy

461
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,399
Alongside such things as like

462
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
All we have to fear is fear

463
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
A slash globalist

464
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Golden Krust robloxia

465
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Oh and he stands for freedom

466
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Freedom

467
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
And

468
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
And his

469
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
Listeners are buying those 17:7

470
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
76 coins because they like

471
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
First Amendment

472
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
Well actually I I want to get back to your observations but I I want to point out that he was not lie

473
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Lying about

474
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Being clear about the markup on the coin

475
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
No it's true

476
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
Yeah he does lie about margins on other products but that woman is totally

477
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
About

478
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
When it comes to physical

479
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Currency you cannot

480
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
He said on the stand like

481
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
The conservatives know about gold and silver and I think that's why he couldn't get away with bluffing the margin

482
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Whereas other things at the how much

483
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Beats cost

484
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
His audience knows

485
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
The price of gold but I guess

486
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
This is my audience doesn't know that the covid-19

487
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Adidas free

488
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,920
But they do know 150 percent markup when they see it

489
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Are those coins gold or are they gold

490
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Downtown I think they're silver

491
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Call Oakview

492
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
I feel like Alex is always been a little bit more of a silver

493
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,072
Hawk then a gold medal made it clear today he even pointed out he was like

494
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
The point

495
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,424
99 silver coin or whatever it is

496
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Yeah

497
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,080
That cost you - $2 2 to buy Teddy Roosevelt going

498
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
His demeanor in court was

499
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,064
Unusual I mean it was not it was sort of the same and that he was sweating

500
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,184
To him this is the same temperature as as Austin

501
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Definitely sweating

502
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:27,584
But but also a very rapid sort of eye blink

503
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Yeah really

504
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,824
Really kind of a running his words together and you know doing that

505
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
That sort of

506
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Thing that he does

507
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
That's where he

508
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
She hasn't like a

509
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
Hausler of words together and then he

510
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,088
She gets to the right place but there's just it's almost like

511
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
The connection goes in the middle of the sentence

512
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Do you know what I mean

513
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
Oh yeah I was

514
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Edit certain point

515
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
So off

516
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Put by the blinker

517
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,656
But I was Googling around

518
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
For like

519
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Is it a symptom of something

520
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
Time does really like a

521
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Nicole damage

522
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
Despise me too much but I received more than one text

523
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
Amphetamine abuse

524
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
The

525
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,088
With the CNN reporter in the courtroom

526
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
Mention that during one of the breaks

527
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,976
He pulled out some kind of manila envelope

528
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
Took some

529
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Kind of medical

530
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
Acacia

531
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Well that's how we all carry our meds around

532
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Goddamnit what a weirdo

533
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Abnormal first

534
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
Aquaman

535
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
Who knows

536
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Superman

537
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
I did not witness this myself I hasten to add

538
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
Okay so this is technically hearsay

539
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
I would go and Cersei

540
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
Reindeer say

541
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,488
Rainforest over super Bale for this country has liquid though isn't it

542
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
He puts it under the tongue

543
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Or the base El Paso

544
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
Debate that happened

545
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
The recipe

546
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Yeah the beats

547
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
Yeah that was it that was an interesting thing

548
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,640
Ura you've been in the courtroom obviously this entire time and

549
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,712
Today's display was one of

550
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,808
The more shameful things I think that has ever happened like how does it

551
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Feel The Beat

552
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Really

553
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
F***** up intense hatred

554
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
It feels like

555
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Between everybody

556
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Professionally involved there

557
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Like the lawyers

558
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
The judge like

559
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
No one's happy

560
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Yeah it's

561
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Pretty

562
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Yeah

563
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,568
There's a there's definitely a vibe that goes through the room when he was walking in now

564
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
I was kind of wondering to myself

565
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
You know

566
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,528
Especially the first three rows where you have the families and the people close

567
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
Not all love lost there and

568
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
I was wondering to see thrive on that

569
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Or does that

570
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Bother him I couldn't really tell

571
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
You know

572
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
I mean is it isn't just

573
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Any kind of

574
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Focused attention whether it's like

575
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Focused hatred or

576
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
Neutral attention or

577
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,152
Or admiration is it all the same to Alex Jones or

578
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Or what

579
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,272
I think I think from his earlier career you could make an argument that folks

580
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,576
This negative attention is actually

581
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
More

582
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Appealing

583
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
Thrive in situations where he's

584
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Yelling at people in there all

585
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
Yelling at him or

586
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
You confronting somebody Ori

587
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
You know

588
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Years

589
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
The bullhorn

590
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
Approaches I don't know I think

591
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
He doesn't do that as much

592
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Now

593
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
For whatever reason but even

594
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,664
Even around the time of like a women's March

595
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
No he was going out and yelling

596
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Cupcake

597
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
You know like

598
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Eat

599
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't know I mean I think he likes negative attention more and

600
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Just kind of

601
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Weird

602
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Imagine that

603
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Extends to a courtroom

604
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
And Sandy Hook families

605
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Yeah

606
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Well I guess

607
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
That's one of the reasons he's not showing up in court I mean I think the kind of negative attention where he's yelling at someone in there

608
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,616
Trying to go back and he's drowning them out is exactly

609
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,200
Yep sitting you know in a place where

610
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
People are

611
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Quiet

612
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
And actually very dignified but also

613
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Hating him down the last

614
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Yeah might be disconcerting

615
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
Yeah and you got to think for

616
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
For Alex

617
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Like I mean

618
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
If I put myself in this space and if I walked

619
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Cindy Court I would

620
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
Feel like

621
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Psychically like I had hand

622
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Topside regardless of what

623
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
Courtroom I was walking into for whatever purpose

624
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
That's what

625
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Associated

626
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
My brain

627
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
But

628
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Cuffs mean

629
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Half as much

630
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
The Alex as not being able to scream what he wants

631
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
Still at somebody

632
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
So like

633
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
If I were going to diagnose what his main issue I don't think

634
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
He cares about the

635
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Attention

636
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
So much as when he's

637
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Talking

638
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
He's not allowed

639
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
To say what he wants

640
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Do and it's going to dry them

641
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
You know it did seem to at the end

642
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah I boiled up he boiled up lady

643
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
T-Pain you could almost feel that

644
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
That

645
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Resist

646
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Breaking down

647
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
Or whatever you know. There was like

648
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,064
Alright I'm not going to ramble off a bunch of nonsense

649
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
And then at some point

650
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Yeah I buy tea kettle boiling

651
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Iqu

652
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Call Dad

653
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
That end of the day today

654
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Was

655
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
Banana yeah I don't know what to I don't know how to put it like it's it was so

656
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Unnerving

657
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
It didn't feel good

658
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
It's

659
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Ikea

660
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Saying that I feel on

661
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Unsafe

662
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
Sing this trial

663
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Yeah like

664
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
I don't know what's going to happen

665
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Things

666
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Don't feel any

667
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Control

668
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Norm clearly doesn't have any kind of a handle on

669
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
Alex told the judge

670
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Yeah

671
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,816
He was muttering to himself

672
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
Walking down the corridor after court

673
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Adjourn

674
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Saying

675
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
What way

676
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,568
What was this thing I would he said I am not

677
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,224
Appliance keeper and I thought you swear to God I almost I almost interrupted you and said I am not

678
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,320
Not My Brother's Keeper I swear to God I was the waiver.

679
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,440
That's awesome now this also reveals

680
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Unawareness

681
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,792
The Bible because the answer to m i My Brother's Keeper is yet

682
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,888
Norm

683
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Is trying to knock

684
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,776
You know the good guy in that story was not the one

685
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Who is that

686
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
Who is this

687
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Vets

688
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
There is a

689
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
I don't know what I mean

690
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,464
I think there is a delinquency in Norm's laissez-faire attitude

691
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
I am grasping at words

692
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
It's here but I think he's being negligent

693
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,704
You know you got the distinct impression that

694
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,312
He is performing for Alex as much as Alex is performing

695
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
For him that's what I was thinking

696
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
Yeah that

697
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Let you know as soon as

698
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
The things God

699
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Heated

700
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
You started

701
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Barely jumping up

702
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,856
Up and down and set up jection objection objection and as the judge pointed out

703
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
You are objecting to things your client

704
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Is saying

705
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
Which is actually a good thing when your client is Alex

706
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
You know

707
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,216
You can't complete violation of the rules

708
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
So she was so she was saying

709
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,664
What are you doing Norm you know you're basically

710
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Object your ear

711
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Your your objections first of all

712
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
You're a client is ignoring you so

713
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
You know when when your own lawyer of Jack

714
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
You stopped

715
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,512
Talking and you wait for a ruling cuz chances are you're not going to have to answer the question

716
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
It right

717
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Stephen just kept talking

718
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:34,496
Didn't matter if Norm was injecting it didn't matter if Norms objections were sustained which men

719
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
Alex wouldn't have to answer the question

720
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
I was just

721
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
Kept rolling cuz what he was doing was looking for a knob

722
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Opportunity

723
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,248
To break the rules against making this a political

724
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Kind of trial

725
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
Not supposed to talk about electoral college

726
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
Presidential politics are political figures

727
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
He's not supposed to make this

728
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Partisan

729
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Thanks

730
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
She was a b

731
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Absolutely looking for every up

732
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
Opportunity to slip that in there he's not supposed

733
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,192
First Amendment rights he's not supposed to talk about it

734
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Does bankruptcy

735
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
He's got a

736
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,384
A lot of you know use the term handcuffs handcuffs

737
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Cheyenne bus

738
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Do Olive

739
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,480
So that was all he was looking for

740
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
Eleanor was just so you know I'm going to show Alex that I'm objecting objecting objecting at Stanley's lawyer

741
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Where is going out

742
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,000
So we just got to the point where he was just shouting objection

743
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:34,400
Do you know if you would have stopped him and said what are you objecting to I don't think he would have had an answer cuz it was just he was

744
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
Adding to the general tumult in the room

745
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
Well you can't just say shut up Alex you missed an opportunity to be like this whole Court rooms out of order

746
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,200
There it was

747
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Brunuhville you know what

748
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Cuz I hadn't thought about

749
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
But you bring it up in that list of things that Alex

750
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
Couldn't talk about

751
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
The partisan politics

752
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
6 aspect

753
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Makes it

754
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Steam

755
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Like there was

756
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Kind of an intention behind like

757
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Conservatives know the

758
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
The price of gold

759
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,144
Ben silver

760
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
App for no reason

761
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
When they do back

762
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Back and forth exchange was happening towards the end

763
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Alex said

764
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,432
Something along the lines of you liberals wanted to kill everybody in Iraq

765
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
Turn it off and on

766
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Yeah but like

767
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
It's interesting that

768
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
The Liberals are to blame for

769
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,928
It seemed like a non-sequitur until I was imagining

770
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
Looking at it through the prism of like making this

771
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Sort of a partisan political idea

772
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah so here's what I

773
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
I think there were two things here

774
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,288
One is that some of the Sandy Hook families in this case

775
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Have been Act

776
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,640
Given the gun control movement some of them have been Act

777
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
They've been democratic

778
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Politics

779
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
He wants

780
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
To bring that up

781
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,064
Because of course his false theory of the case

782
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Is that

783
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
This is enough

784
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,768
Offered by the Deep State and the Democrats and all of his political enemies to silence him this is not

785
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,096
What about you know the abuse these families have been subjected to

786
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
Because of his years worth of lying about

787
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Sandy Hook

788
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
No

789
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
Be you do a persecution thing so that's

790
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
1 and 2nd

791
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
I think and because Norms doing it to a he knows Alex is watching him on TV so he is

792
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Performing

793
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
For his clients

794
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
But second

795
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Get the sense that there might be

796
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
They have

797
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Nathan

798
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
There are

799
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Some conservatives

800
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
On the jury

801
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,840
And they are playing to the gallery basically

802
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,656
Not forget the element that Norm is also just

803
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
Crazy

804
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Yeah he is a nut bag

805
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
That that is a fact

806
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Yeah I mean I think

807
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Based on the way that I'm I'm

808
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Interpreting

809
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
You know what you're saying and then

810
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Experience was with

811
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
With the Jerry and Alex

812
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Is just like

813
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
I feel like

814
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
In his mind

815
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
In a murder trial

816
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,024
All you have to do is convince one member of

817
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
The jury of

818
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,656
Reasonable not-guilty that kind

819
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
In in my mind what I'm seeing him do is like

820
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
We've seen politics

821
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
Override

822
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Everybody

823
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Thoughts

824
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
To the point where sometimes

825
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Do you see people say absolutely in

826
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Saying s*** just

827
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
Because it's like I'm

828
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
I'm with

829
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Which team

830
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm with the Republic

831
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
Continue no would make sense

832
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
That he would think you know

833
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
If I can get a couple of these conservatives

834
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
Completely remove any and all independence

835
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Thought

836
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
Which is possible

837
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Then maybe you can get out of it

838
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
Well it's that by the way

839
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
Yeah it's the

840
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,664
Alex talked about this and has historically for a long time there is a philosophy of Jerry Nolan

841
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Application

842
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
It has to do with

843
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
Usually in like criminal things like

844
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
What was the jury does

845
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
Don't think what you did was wrong they cannot

846
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
That is

847
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
A dangerous

848
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
Kind of idea in some apple

849
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Occasion

850
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
Yeah I think everybody knows the

851
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Set the Constitution wanted to

852
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
The jury to take the law into their own hands

853
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Ignore the

854
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
The judge and the lawyers and judge

855
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
Just think about who's on there

856
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,152
I think he's hoping for that

857
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
But hey

858
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
I think after today at

859
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Probably is tough

860
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
4

861
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Most

862
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Of the jury to think

863
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
He's taking this

864
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Seriously

865
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Right I mean

866
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
Pastor Buell prevalent feeling

867
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Yeah

868
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Yeah

869
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Yeah

870
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Because

871
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
You know it wasn't

872
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,360
Just I mean that the Outburst at the end in the craziness got all the attention but

873
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Throughout

874
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
He was completely mendacious and he was pretending

875
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Daddy's really didn't know

876
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
What was going on on his show you know everything about you know this headline they did it they put that

877
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Bravo somebody might event

878
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,840
You at the same time you had Infowars employees who have been deposed under oath and they have said

879
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
Alex Jones calls all the shots

880
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
You know for better or worse

881
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Usually For Worse

882
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
So

883
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah so the idea that

884
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
You know he wasn't

885
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
He wasn't sure what was going on in his own shop

886
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Consistently

887
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
Visa V Sandy Hook

888
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
This doesn't make any sense

889
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
I've never been to Greece

890
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Set reminder

891
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:47,488
He's so much whatever he said every time he was like I didn't know who titled that

892
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,816
We're at it's not my finger I don't get daily updates

893
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,888
I just remembered Ari is testimony as the Corp

894
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
Representative

895
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:00,544
I mean there were so many times where I remember just being like

896
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
Well she shouldn't have said that

897
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Nope that one says Alex

898
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Controls

899
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,944
Everything you know like

900
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
You should not have done that

901
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
That was a

902
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Boy

903
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:19,232
Video of the two corporate Representatives you know Brittany pause

904
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
Who is the corporate representative in this case vs Daria

905
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
Wow that that were those were two different types

906
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
Yeah yeah this

907
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
This had a real mercenary a-spec

908
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
To it

909
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
Where is Daria was like

910
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,432
He'll also a religion

911
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
I will destroy all of you

912
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
With one look

913
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
I wrestle with this

914
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
I'm not

915
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
Rich by any means

916
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,512
But I can't imagine doing the job that Britney pass did

917
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
For 30,000

918
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Dollars

919
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,376
That is yeah I think she really went home

920
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Feeling ripped off

921
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
IAAI

922
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
I hope

923
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,056
I mean I don't know if I hope I don't know what I hope I were if I hope it at all but

924
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,872
I kind of hope there was a bit of under-the-table money

925
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:14,272
Workers rights

926
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
Why are you lying with labor no matter what perfect

927
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,720
It's 30,000 Infowars

928
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,120
There's enough of them wga East my actually take them in

929
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
They're fixing writer

930
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
I think I think

931
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Today obviously the big thing

932
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
King is this

933
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
This outburst

934
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
Kirsten and how the day ended

935
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
But I actually think

936
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
There was

937
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,808
Maybe the most important thing that came out of today

938
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Was

939
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
The questioning

940
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
About

941
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:57,536
Matthew Mills the guy who interrupted the Super Bowl

942
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Interview

943
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
And one of the reasons that I think this was so important

944
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
Just to give a short breakdown of what it is

945
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
Alex

946
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Had Matthew Mills

947
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
On his show who is the guy who

948
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
Is the 2014 Super Bowl I believe

949
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
He

950
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Interrupted

951
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,320
Did the MVP press conference at the Eldorado 9/11 was an inside job

952
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
On the show and

953
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Was like you're the best

954
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
You're so great

955
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,000
I love you I got to give you a job you're my Soldier

956
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Not whatever

957
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
Yeah brother

958
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Very enthusiastic about him

959
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,936
And Alex had to own all that

960
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
And then

961
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
It's revealed

962
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
McGee

963
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Matthew Mills

964
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Was arrested later

965
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
For harassing

966
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,480
DeSoto family members at their charity 5k

967
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Yeah

968
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
The reason I think

969
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,600
This is so critical is that it draws this

970
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Straight line

971
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Between

972
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Alex

973
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
Endorsing

974
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Offering to hire

975
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,280
Congratulating

976
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,584
This person who is doing essentially

977
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,472
Let me know how is it any different than harassing people at the 5K

978
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
Actually I agree with you guys

979
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,384
That was really a revelation to me I mean

980
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,992
I really know some of that I mean he

981
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
The facts

982
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:26,624
This is what I didn't catch even when I was writing my book you know I wrote

983
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,696
I put an entry in about Matthew Mills

984
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
And what happened at the

985
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
The 5K

986
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,816
But I did not know that on

987
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Infowars

988
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Jim Jones said and they played that clip

989
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
You know I've got some other disruption I wanted and I'm paraphrasing here but I've got some other destruction I want to talk to

990
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
You about offline

991
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
And this

992
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,456
You know this disruption of the 5K came after that

993
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,064
So whether it was exactly that or not and of course Jones said it wasn't

994
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,904
It does as you stayed and robbed at line and

995
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,744
You do one of the challenges here for the lawyers

996
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
In this

997
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Particular case

998
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
Is that

999
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Very few of

1000
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
These plaintiffs have been named

1001
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
By Alex Jones on the show

1002
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
And it's

1003
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Harder to draw that

1004
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:22,432
Direct line so this I thought I agreed this was really kind of a revelation I didn't know he had had

1005
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
That guy on celebrated him and then he went on to

1006
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Disrupt

1007
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
That event

1008
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,624
For Vicki Soto the teacher who was killed at Sandy Hook

1009
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,464
Yeah and I think one of Alex's

1010
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
Good primary

1011
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
Maybe primary defenses but one of the things that's thrown around a lot is

1012
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Even if

1013
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
People were harassed

1014
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Nothing

1015
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
Things to do with me you can't draw the line right

1016
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,080
Check with me and I think that this case of the Matthew Mills thing

1017
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
So damning

1018
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Because it disrupt

1019
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
That are

1020
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
Yeah

1021
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
It's not just

1022
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
Somebody who like maybe

1023
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
Emailed Alex or that like

1024
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Like tenuous connection

1025
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,927
This person had Alex's full-throated support and

1026
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
A job offer and

1027
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
They conspired on air about

1028
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
The behavior that is

1029
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Boob

1030
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,703
Disruption of the 5K whether or not they actually

1031
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
Conspired and Alex paid him

1032
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
You do that

1033
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Leaving that aside right

1034
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,127
They had the conversation about him being employed to do

1035
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Physically that right

1036
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:31,807
Well I mean they made big enough I think it was raining all who made the argument in court he was he was saying like

1037
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Okay

1038
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Isn't

1039
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,159
It a crime for people to do these

1040
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,023
So for people to harass somebody like that it's a crime

1041
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Is a federal crime

1042
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Why haven't they been arrested

1043
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,423
So how can you say that they you know that it was that

1044
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
That bad

1045
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:54,847
Done a little bit of that this time especially with the exaggeration claims and and if you

1046
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
If you got that

1047
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Boy

1048
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
F****** that sucks

1049
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Yeah

1050
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,831
If Alex can just yell jussie Smollett whenever anybody says he makes things up and why can't everybody.

1051
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,743
He's like you can't connect me to any of this baby with Matthew Mills

1052
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
That actually was

1053
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Criminy

1054
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Flat out

1055
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,703
Suspended one-year term in a couple years probation

1056
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
For disrupt

1057
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
Sing that 5K

1058
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
And you know that wasn't just like

1059
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,151
I stood on the sidelines and yelled he had

1060
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
Photo and

1061
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,295
Approached the family and they kind of got him corralled into one area and

1062
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,879
You know it was kind of a scary thing for them there were a lot of little

1063
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Children are and

1064
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
You know about

1065
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Was bizarre

1066
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
But I

1067
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
I had no idea that there was that

1068
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Direct link

1069
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,887
To Alex Jones and that he was encouraging

1070
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
The type of

1071
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Destruction that would be

1072
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Like the

1073
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Destruction of the

1074
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
The 5K

1075
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,079
I'm just very hopeful that

1076
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,455
I'm sure the jury does understand the importance of that but they see that

1077
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
And the

1078
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
The disrespect Alex as for the process

1079
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
And that really does

1080
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Sort of in

1081
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Inform

1082
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Their understanding

1083
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
King of the case

1084
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
And like

1085
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
I think we already said it.

1086
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
The way he's he's acting is like

1087
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
Why did you get the faulted oh I get it

1088
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,959
It's really funny just on a on a

1089
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Count of life

1090
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Alex

1091
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Say

1092
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
Cuz it would be it would almost be worth

1093
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
He was like no no no

1094
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,175
When I said I was going to give him a job

1095
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
I was lying to a c

1096
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
I lie on air

1097
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
People in order to make my own now that doesn't

1098
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,391
String them along to keep her ass people for free

1099
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Exactly

1100
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,095
It was funny to see him sort of faced with his own hyperbole to either wear

1101
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Yeah he's saying

1102
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
My broadcast reaches 10% of the English-speaking world and you can just see Jones on the

1103
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Pakistan going

1104
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
I know I should disagree be

1105
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Because that's

1106
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
That would help minimize

1107
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
The Damage Done

1108
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,551
But the way I love the sound of that 10%

1109
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,927
And from depositions who knows that they have audio of him saying that on his ship

1110
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
So his

1111
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
Is compromised I I appreciate it

1112
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
Who compromises to be like

1113
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
Not everybody speaks English that's probably like two

1114
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
10 million people Max Wright

1115
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,383
About 10% of the English-speaking world there's like 20 guys you speak English that's one person

1116
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
Have a Tanto now

1117
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,807
And that his soul thing of you disagreeing with

1118
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Clint Walker

1119
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
Social media expert who said that

1120
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
You know at minimum over the ghetto 6 years

1121
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
Neil from the time of the shooting

1122
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,887
That's 550 million

1123
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
Pageviews

1124
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239

Content

1126
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
Came by a social media

1127
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
And Jones turn that in

1128
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Into

1132
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
Earlier than the week

1133
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
550 million people

1134
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
There aren't that many

1135
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
People in the English-speaking world do you know it wasn't 5

1136
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,767
150 million people it was 500

1137
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
50 million views

1138
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Yeah

1139
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Use a straw man and

1140
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
The

1141
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Appearance of

1142
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Being confused

1143
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
In order to avoid

1144
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Responsibility

1145
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
That's just kind of like

1146
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
It's a simple tactic

1147
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
But it's also like

1148
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
I don't know it's

1149
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,967
Kind of a self-directed form of Gaslight

1150
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Yeah

1151
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,087
Yeah more than 550 million people

1152
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Speak English on the

1153
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
This dumb planet

1154
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
Like 8 billion people practice

1155
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,279
Yeah I would say so especially a second language

1156
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Yeah

1157
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,399
Well

1158
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Dickwad

1159
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Probably baby

1160
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
But don't have the internet

1161
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,871
Or are you the Sioux are going to Infowars

1162
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
Test whether or not they can respond to English

1163
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Word

1164
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,527
In order to see whether or not they are capable of being in the English

1165
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,927
Object permanence and then see if they know the false flag

1166
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
Is speaking of

1167
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
English speaking and reading world

1168
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
I ran into a couple who run at an anti

1169
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Bookstore

1170
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Very near the courthouse

1171
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,055
And I was chatting with them and the wife

1172
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
The couple said

1173
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
You know we were thinking that

1174
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,551
The local newspaper interviewed me about the trial coming to town and saying is this going

1175
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Bruce the fortune

1176
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
And she was like God

1177
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
She goes

1178
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Hello

1179
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:06,655
A trial of a conspiracy theorist in Waterbury is going to boost the fortunes of an ant

1180
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,983
Aquarian bookstore do you really think any

1181
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
ORS

1182
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
Fans are spending much

1183
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
Diamond the store like ours

1184
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
And they must

1185
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,735
Be reading the newspaper because she got a bunch

1186
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783
Abuse after that article came out

1187
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Open

1188
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
I think our business would boost

1189
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
If I had decided to come

1190
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
Trial cuz that sounds like

1191
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,327
Exactly where I want to be worried about her if I came to the trial

1192
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Yeah I would

1193
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Single wide

1194
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
Female that lady instantly

1195
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,703
That's the life I want to live

1196
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Aquarium books

1197
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,079
Stewart would wear a wig I would pretend to be married to that guy that's

1198
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
Oh that's by the way that's where I go immediately

1199
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
There is a

1200
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
Used books

1201
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Bookstore here in

1202
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Chicago

1203
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
That I think might be attacked

1204
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,135
Shelter I'm not entirely sure

1205
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
They have a bunch of old books and the guy there is really grumpy one of the greatest human beings on the planet

1206
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
Spent so much time in there

1207
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Everyone that can

1208
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,679
Comes in his store and everything I've ever wanted and dreamed of

1209
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,775
We should we wear out

1210
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
Candy reviews people

1211
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
And

1212
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,151
Wait a minute

1213
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,527
Connection while one of them involves literacy the other

1214
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,879
Very much literacy so much ultimate

1215
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,207
Two poles that are ways to go

1216
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
We should probably wrap this up here before too long cuz

1217
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
I mean you've been so kind with you

1218
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
Your time and you have room service there

1219
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,447
If they don't want to keep you

1220
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Afroman

1221
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
But

1222
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Buffet

1223
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
Before we goes there anything else that's on your mind

1224
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
About the

1225
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
A trial or about

1226
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
Current events that that we haven't brought up that it's anything

1227
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
Anything that

1228
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
Final the other I mean we're talking about this and there are a lot

1229
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
Our moments where you just got all my God but I have

1230
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
How to say there is one

1231
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
One you know aspect

1232
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
To boost that really does bother me and that's

1233
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
What's that

1234
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
You know

1235
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:18,751
This absolute circus that's been happening in the courtroom and

1236
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,591
Just every time they bring up an Infowars video

1237
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
I just look at these families and I I think

1238
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
This is yet one more

1239
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Yeah

1240
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
Yeah

1241
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
Mountain of

1242
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,647
Abuse and disrespect

1243
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
And

1244
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,023
That that part is really disturbing

1245
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
You know I mean it's just

1246
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
Yeah day after day

1247
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,423
Having them sit there you know there

1248
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,215
Carrying that law

1249
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,103
Wherever they go and to be sitting there and watching this all unfold has

1250
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
Got2b

1251
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
I mean they have

1252
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,271
Yeah I've talked with them obviously a little bit not not a lot

1253
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Because there's not a lot of

1254
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Either they don't want

1255
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
To be worse

1256
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,183
Giving interviews or anything like that but

1257
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
I think

1258
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Ghetto

1259
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,047
They take it in stride but it

1260
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,143
At the same time I'm sure there are many moments where they sit and think

1261
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
How did any of this

1262
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
This happen

1263
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Yeah

1264
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
Yeah

1265
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
And that's the real shame of it

1266
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,871
Yeah and there's got to be a

1267
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Feels

1268
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
Through the the screen

1269
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,783
A little bit of in some of the testimonies of the plaintiff

1270
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Yeah

1271
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
I'd almost

1272
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Disbelief

1273
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
Like

1274
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
People are Act

1275
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Things away

1276
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Alexandra

1277
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
Rrak

1278
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
Yeah I mean

1279
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,655
Idea of life okay

1280
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
I Am David

1281
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,751
Respa several of the family members who have

1282
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,311
Testified already and I'm sure more will

1283
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
Express this

1284
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
Yeah just this idea of

1285
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
I

1286
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:10,111
There has been so much unbelievable and not in a good way you know just this idea of like

1287
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,671
I can't believe any of this happened

1288
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
And now

1289
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
This

1290
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,559
You know seriously there are people who

1291
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,095
Actually say

1292
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,655
That my child or my

1293
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,239
My wife for my my mom or my sister

1294
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Didn't didn't die

1295
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:34,431
You know it's only as one of the moms put it you know if only it wouldn't that be amazing

1296
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
If that actually didn't happen

1297
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,015
But just that idea of like

1298
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Okay

1299
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
I just getting your mind around the fact

1300
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Set this

1301
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,439
Unbelievable losses occurred and then there

1302
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
A significant number of

1303
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
People say that

1304
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
It never happened

1305
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
And

1306
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
It just

1307
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,495
I saw one of your tweets somebody said it in the courtroom next

1308
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
Yes

1309
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,639
That's crazy

1310
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,319
I'm sleeping through all of it

1311
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
Not all of it

1312
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,463
Yeah I know today about I came into the courtroom and

1313
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
He was

1314
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
She was hot

1315
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
By the bailiff cuz he said

1316
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
Is this the first amendment trial

1317
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,167
And I thought oh and then

1318
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
They played

1319
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
The tape of

1320
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,287
Robbie Parker reminiscing about his daughter Emily

1321
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:38,687
The night after she was killed at Sandy Hook in the press conference that we all know about because John's

1322
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,039
Spent the next several years you know using it as fodder on his show and

1323
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,575
I'm calling Robbie an actor

1324
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
But the guy behind me

1325
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:52,767
It starts snickering during the stress conference in a lot of the families were weeping it's one of those

1326
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,559
Those you know

1327
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Kind of

1328
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,423
Orange that no matter how many times you see it

1329
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
You think

1330
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,775
Oh my God you just feel his pain and he is off

1331
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
Offering forgiveness for the gunman

1332
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,639
To the gunman which is just amazing

1333
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,431
And so a lot of people were

1334
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,735
Pretty emotional and here's the

1335
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,551
Doofus behind me

1336
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Snickering enjoying word

1337
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,487
Yeah I know you knew you could see I was trying to yeah

1338
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
It's not exactly the word I'm think

1339
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Eddie's going

1340
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Steak

1341
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
Nitto

1342
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,751
10 years on

1343
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Yeah

1344
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Thinking is

1345
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
There's

1346
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
There's a reality that

1347
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Everyone else is a

1348
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Experiencing

1349
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
Yeah and then there's

1350
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
These folks

1351
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
You are not

1352
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
Willing to live

1353
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
In that reality

1354
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,255
I understand Alex's unwillingness

1355
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
I get it

1356
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
From

1357
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
Studying his

1358
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Career in

1359
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
Knowing what

1360
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,935
Profiteering piece of s*** he is

1361
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,495
You know I understand that motivation

1362
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
Sorry I'm sorry

1363
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
But I just it's still hard

1364
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,871
To understand how people can be that

1365
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Deeply invested in

1366
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
A false reality that

1367
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
That's

1368
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,903
Then why would you even be in the courtroom in the first place

1369
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
If that's your

1370
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,279
The way you're going to behave like you

1371
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327

No Elizabeth that's that is kind of getting it goes all the way back to that that

1382
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519

00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
Press conference

1384
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,847

Headspace

00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
If I'm

1389
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
Family member

1390
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,527

00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
It's it's

1397
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
It's brutal

1398
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
Well

1399
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
Speed proof of

1400
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,655
The argument of the

1401
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:43,263
The case essentially that you use this fear and you use these tactics

1402
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
It's an order to

1403
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,847
You get people into a mindset

1404
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,943
I'm at where they're willing to do things like show up at a courtroom

1405
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:56,575
We're grieving family members know are having their day in court and say things like

1406
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
This is so fake

1407
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
I know but

1408
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Specifically when it comes

1409
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:05,279
Things to do there is that but it when it comes to you know like Alex

1410
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
Dallas does that on the show he

1411
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607

1412
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
Are you got where he is

1413
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,679

00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
You know

1416
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263

1417
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031

00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
