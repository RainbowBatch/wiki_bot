1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Regular

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
Do no f****** dudes to sit around

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
I talk about a thing

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,096
Like Charlie Rose or something like that

6
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Folks were

7
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,032
You know they know a lot more emotionally even-keeled

8
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
Our little bit nuts

9
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
And I know I don't know what's going on

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
And his world to a lot of the issues plaguing

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
Immediately

12
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
Nice

13
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
A water along with

14
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Tito's vodka down a little bit

15
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
So today that's the plan

16
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
The cure for what ails you

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
Speaking of what cures

18
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
The cause of and solution to

19
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
All of life

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
If you would like to become yourself knowledge

21
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
It's a delightful

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Under sulfide

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
Hey

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,816
2015

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
Span of time between

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
2 / 12

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
October 15th

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Alright today is Earth shattering

29
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Today

30
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
We make some real progress

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Or do we

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Only one way to find out

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,904
You know what this is I walked like 5 miles

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
From therapy scratched me on like

35
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,024
Weird mood almost

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,888
Almost like I'm some headspace I might get a little silly

37
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Alright

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Call vodka

39
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
This is the technique for Alex's right all along

40
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
To my wristband

41
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
The f******

42
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
Global Fitbit

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
Before we get Today Show I'd like to start off

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
With two out of context drops

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Alex Jones

46
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
The special episode we got to

47
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,944
Slaves around New York on change

48
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Alright

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm going to go with

50
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
New York

51
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,584
Quebec City

52
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
This is

53
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Because

54
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
The whole purpose of us going back to

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
2015

56
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,368
Investigation Alex Jones

57
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
You love Donald Trump

58
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Right

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
The whole point

60
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
But along the way

61
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Figure out what he thinks about others

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,143
Actually on the same time we're going over today

63
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,495
Discusses what he thinks about Bernie Sanders

64
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Parasailing

65
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,943
The top one tenth of 1% in this country 90%

66
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
August 12th

67
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,719
57%

68
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,679
Healthcap to all people as a right

69
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Except you.

70
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
You see every other when you have a baby when I'm going to separate you

71
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
Paid

72
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
People from the UK

73
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,591
Rdr2

74
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Getting things down

75
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,415
Either export an entire clip that I record

76
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Export a part that I have highlights

77
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
And sometimes

78
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
I f*** that up

79
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
The problem with you in a good head

80
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
You're not

81
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Focus

82
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
You're too happy you're going around thinking about all the good things that could happen

83
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Instead of here

84
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Lot

85
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
Please

86
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
Getting these clips

87
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
I apologize I listen to it

88
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Petty and stupid as Alex was being

89
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Hewlett-Packard

90
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
A lot

91
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Yeah

92
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
Almost anything

93
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
He didn't have anything to come back with Alex

94
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
Bernie Sanders

95
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Express

96
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
I don't think it is audience would really register

97
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
He's getting at

98
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
If you didn't play a quiz for

99
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,679
I always think there's a reason why he's over or doesn't talk over a cliff

100
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
He's either trying to

101
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Show dominance

102
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
He just doesn't give a s*** and wants

103
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Score points

104
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
People talk

105
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
He's either reverent to them

106
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Or he knows that

107
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Do you need contacts

108
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
In order to score points

109
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
Later like with that shity impression

110
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
I don't know man

111
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Wellow

112
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
Bernie had not yet become the most popular politician in the United

113
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Yeah as he is now

114
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
He was

115
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
Sittin at this point he's just a social

116
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Listen

117
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
God dammit

118
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
God dammit

119
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
But

120
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
If you are an Alex Jones listener and you hear that

121
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
That's one of those things that

122
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
It surprises me because that is a

123
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Hugely popular position

124
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
Across the Spectrum if you're an Alex Jones listener

125
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
You're not hearing any of these conspiracy theories

126
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,775
You're just hearing Bernie make a goddamn

127
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,663
You're being played on Alex's show

128
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
What is

129
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
That

130
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
This guy is lying

131
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
Of course he's going to say that you're going to get all these things but that's just a

132
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
The trap to get to tyranny

133
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
Because Alex is already laid that that sort of narrative bed in place

134
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
So even if Bernie Sanders comes on

135
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Is all the things

136
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
It doesn't matter it's not going to

137
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
What is

138
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
What Alex has

139
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Liberty Way

140
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
He let Bernie talk

141
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
The

142
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Problem

143
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Which is

144
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
The top one tenth of 1%

145
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367
More wealth than the bottom

146
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
Globalist

147
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
And Bernie Sanders won't audit the Fed

148
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Who complained about that

149
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Where's that

150
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Hope I made her pretend that doesn't matter

151
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
Probably in their in their world absolute

152
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
We're going to start on October 12th

153
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,431
I'm telling you is a lot of interesting stuff we got to discuss coming up

154
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
It's that it's fairly song

155
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Barely

156
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Really underselling every

157
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
You're often come back after

158
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
You're somebody's broken your heart or something so we can

159
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Read my emails from 2015

160
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
I really probably out

161
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
Here's a clip Alex that starts off his show on the 12th explaining

162
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Do you cannot compromise with

163
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Globalist

164
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
National sovereignty does not exist

165
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
The family does not exist mother and father does not exist

166
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
The Amish do not exist

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,167
It's so over-the-top

168
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
People have to realize

169
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
You can't be reasonable

170
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,807
You can't compromise with the globalist

171
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
They are not the left

172
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
They are hardcore

173
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Asian

174
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
Focused

175
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Groups concrete mesh

176
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
Mid-level managers

177
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
If you're sitting around a cocktail

178
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,751
Your table with him and say of course we're taking over

179
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Of course were conditioning people we don't know

180
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
And in the left

181
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,303
The general I said that all the time

182
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Ice cream truck music

183
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
Why would they are enemies

184
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,831
And sociopath

185
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
You have no hope

186
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
Okay

187
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
But like I've started to notice

188
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Did Alex Jones starts off

189
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
A disproportionate amount of his shows

190
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Really demonized

191
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
The gift

192
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
It's the last

193
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
You know just serves to radicalize

194
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Okay

195

You hear the ice cream truck

197
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Clearly

198
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
It's not a weirdo

199
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Grown up

200
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,815
It's just evil Carnival

201
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Alright

202
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Beat up

203
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Creeper van

204
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
You go inside

205
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Hoping for ice

206
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
On one hand

207
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Pedophile

208
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,199
Sure other however you might find a demonic Wildcat

209
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
What about you

210
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Preferable

211
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
What about just like a straight-up

212
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Wildcat

213
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Do you want

214
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
That's out of

215
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,519
Wildcat I'm assuming is like at least fifteen percent

216
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah that is true it's like

217
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Steroids anabolic steroids

218
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Alex's mention of the Amish

219
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
There's the option

220
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,399
There's a little narrative that he sells from time to time one of his waypoints back in 2015 that I haven't really

221
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
Deemed just got there was a Amish

222
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Cheese cellar

223
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
That got

224
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Bye

225
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
The government

226
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
It was because he wasn't

227
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Using

228
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Appropriate

229
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
Pasteurization techniques and reply back

230
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
And selling his two years across state line

231
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
So there were a couple issues and then also health issues

232
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
It was a

233
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
You know

234
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
He's dumb

235
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
That's weird

236
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
Gizmo

237
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
Keys for them in this case he's mad because it's the Federal

238
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Because it's like interstate trade

239
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,623
And stuff like that federal government

240
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
He doesn't appreciate that

241
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
What's up Russian

242
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,047

243
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Suppressing me

244
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375

00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,447
I love I love all my mix with these

246
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
Phila federal laws

247
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Breaking

248
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Peeps

249
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Shut up

250
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Shut up

251
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
Next clip

252
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
Just know this next clip

253
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Alex Jones

254
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Protest

255
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
But have been happening in Austin

256
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Sing insight into this on the other side of it

257
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
URL wasn't the onion

258
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
To wear giant dildo

259
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
I am

260
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Also

261
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,743
I need a

262
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,167
Confuse everything

263
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Play Warfare

264
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
So I don't know if you remember this

265
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
I mentioned on a recent episode

266
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
There's a dildo protab

267
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Yeah I remember

268
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
Wasn't that realize that the CIA was behind

269
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
Interest in making sure no one knows that it was the CIA

270
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
You're right

271
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,983
Segment never trust Dan's death

272
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Ciac

273
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,871
Yeah in the same way that Alex

274
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,991
But if you want to take his perspective with a grain of salt even though he's a CIA

275
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Religious studies professor

276
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
I called him

277
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
Earlier

278
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,583
What happened

279
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,727
And I have my dad characterized

280
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
If you had like involved

281
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,919
Dildo protest

282
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Do you have time you're no you're gone

283
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
So it did it started out as kind of a social media joke

284
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
People

285
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Oregon

286
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Open carry on campus

287
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Especially gun being carried in building

288
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
Like campus buildings and stuff like that

289
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
So these students

290
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
They realize that it's a decency crime

291
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Alright

292
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
Carry a dildo openly on Tampa

293
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
You would get an American

294
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
Started this campaign ad the offset

295
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Budget pointing out that absurdity

296
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,671
On a Facebook group or whatever and then it spawned a real proton

297
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
It launched

298
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
On the same day gun-free UT

299
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Which is the

300
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
I would characterize it my dad didn't

301
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Totally agree with this

302
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
But how I would

303
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
Just be broad-stroke version is that's the adult version

304
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Speakers

305
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Bass

306
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Protest against

307
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Scary stuff

308
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
At the same time

309
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
So there was the

310
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Student protest

311
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
That dovetails into the

312
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Adult

313
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Gun free UT Proto

314
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
And

315
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
I mean it's not the CIA

316
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
It's just

317
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Smart

318
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Realizing

319
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
Hey it's illegal for us to have dildos out in public but guns are cool

320
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Yeah

321
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
It is it is fun.

322
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,079
That's a fun way to fight against what is clearly absurd like

323
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
You can't fight on that direct level of there

324
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Dumb

325
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
Anger and stupidity you have to point out

326
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Look at you silly

327
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
You might as well be holding

328
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Cuz you're idiot

329
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
You and then you'll get angry and you'll go underground

330
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,839
And you'll go on stormfront.com

331
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
I just love that cuz on the last time we talked about a gun-free UT protest

332
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Michael Bloomberg

333
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:04,319
Flu ever want

334
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
He's just making this stuff up

335
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
It's crazy

336
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Like I'm thrilled that I have

337
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Into the

338
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
The actual that the truth

339
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
But I just

340
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
I don't think the people listening to Alex Jones

341
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Can realize how often

342
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
He is just making stuff up

343
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
But Bloomberg didn't fly anybody

344
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Bloomberg wasn't involved in a protest at all

345
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Isn't CIA tactics

346
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
It's clown

347
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
It's it's

348
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,815
Overthrow the government

349
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
Like they didn't turn

350
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Regimes into nothing but are dropping

351
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
DVDs of operation

352
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Alex does little planet

353
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,319
Themself

354
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Fancies himself something of a cultural critic

355
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Yes I am

356
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
In this clip

357
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
Paul Joseph Watson is in studio

358
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
They can't sit next to each other

359
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Insist on talking to us

360
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Yeah

361
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
This movie is about globalist

362
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
This about global is right every movie that's their reply

363
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
Jones critiquing

364
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
Criticizes the Martian for not enough Asians

365
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
The whole thing

366
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,776
And a charge of everything

367
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
The Martian

368
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Matt Damon

369
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
And

370
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
He's not actually a Mustang

371
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,696
Voting

372
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Who is the Russian boosters we've got to have

373
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,448
That's what I thought about the US Rockets blow-up it's the Russians

374
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Propaganda

375
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,840
McDonald's McLeod

376
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
There was questions

377
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,824
So for the Chinese to come to the rescue in this film

378
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Cool things

379
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,864
Russia he wanted Russia to be portrayed as the heroes

380
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,704
Because technologically that's accurate or something

381
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,288
There's a couple things there's a lot of issues with the Martians

382
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
300 it's not but also

383
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
It is not real

384
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,040
It's fiction I want to pull out of this

385
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
But I think a really important

386
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
If this was just someone else saying like

387
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
Really Advanced it like if it was anybody else

388
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
I like

389
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,472
Pinpoint

390
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,824
It seems weird that in this movie review he's even got to talk about how great Russia is

391
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
So that's one thing

392
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Yeah I noticed

393
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
The other thing that I think is more important

394
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
To pull out

395
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
Is that it's not propaganda

396
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,344
China is a giant emerging-market for film

397
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
So

398
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
So what movies want to be able to movies don't make as much

399
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
Domestically as they do International

400
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
I want you to take that

401
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Consideration

402
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Often you do have to

403
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
Pandora little we haul it the Transformers

404
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
That's Craven or fake

405
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
I think that's

406
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
Sincerely Multicultural and beautiful

407
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Little bit

408
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,744
Somehow making robots

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
That's a new one thanks

410
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Paki altogether

411
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
Propaganda Alex

412
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Okay

413
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
I'm telling you right here

414
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
Nicolas Cage is the bad guy in the

415
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
That's the truth

416
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
No do you know why what

417
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Not enough Russian

418
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,088
Absolutely

419
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,952
I don't know

420
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
So ridiculous

421
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
Cultural critic

422
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Continuous

423
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
The Martian

424
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
I could just depicting a different

425
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,760
Narratively expedient

426
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
What like

427
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
10 years ago or something like that

428
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Is it alright book

429
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Hey what are you doing

430
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
Potatoes will you talk about being scientifically expedient

431
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Haggai

432
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,496
That's what movies are done

433
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
They don't have to

434
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Explain because they

435
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Dan

436
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
It's predict its predictive

437
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
You don't need hard sci-fi in movies

438
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
No exhaust

439
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Stargate

440
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Targets are real

441
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
Cultural critic

442
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
Meet all of the other Martian soldiers

443
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Which is why they kidnap those kids

444
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
If

445
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,528
Review of the movie

446
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Where are the bases

447
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,392
So this next clip Alex Jones

448
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
Cultural critic like I said continue

449
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
He shows on television

450
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
About Gunn

451
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
And

452
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
What doesn't have guns in it

453
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Well

454
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,776
They're not all about guns though

455
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,616
Talk about that

456
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,992
Cuz you can't even carry

457
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
Can open carry up your butthole

458
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
Always only you could

459
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Canfield

460
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,024
Television

461
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
I meant Hilo

462
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Real hard about how popular it is

463
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
But a free person

464
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
Thomas Jefferson

465
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,032
Has a right to own guns

466
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Amateur fight between a logical

467
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,456
But no more guys means less crime

468
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
And the patio

469
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Turn around God

470
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,904
Every metric every study every poll shows

471
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,792
None of those

472
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
And that's why I was told

473
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
I'd Discovery Channel

474
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
And by the Broncos

475
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
It produces

476
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,600
That 3 years ago the order

477
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
41

478
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,488
On every channel

479
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Number one

480
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Fellowes channels where gun shows

481
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
Here

482
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,536
Wait

483
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,656
I want to shut you down there I just wanted to make sure

484
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
He currently hosts

485
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
To shows on Discovery

486
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
M2 shows on the History Channel

487
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
For television

488
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
How is how can you even possibly say that

489
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
He's hosted

490
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
4

491
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,208
Pilots that never made it to air

492
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
A boy

493
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
There are not four shows on there

494
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
The only

495
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
The only one that's possibly what he's talking about it actually everywhere in 2015.

496
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
When did it got cancelled in 2014

497
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
There's a show called America's Book of Secrets

498
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
We're talking heads

499
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
Like Gods episodes use on her about likes

500
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Secret prison

501
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,552
The billionaire agenda Area 51 Freemasons

502
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,136
Good stuff he's on like 19 episodes of that

503
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Out of like 35

504
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:55,072
I did not know he was a lot on television

505
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
Sultan to Jesse Ventura go to First

506
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,472
What you talking about

507
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,800
America's Book of Secrets wasn't on History channel is on H2

508
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
The secondary History Channel

509
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,920
And if you go past that the only credits he has

510
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Where is not an actor

511
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
And he is free of those

512
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
To Richard linklater movie amerigeddon

513
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,368
The only things he has after America's Book of Secrets

514
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
Until the Joe Rogan

515
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Experience

516
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
AR

517
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:27,072
The Joke is on his IMDb

518
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,448
Before

519
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Which means that was not televised

520
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
State the rise video documentary

521
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Conspiracy theorist live

522
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,880
Which is a documentary about

523
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,000
I wish

524
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
The Conspiracy Theory conspiracy

525
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,192
Which is documentary about conspiracy theories

526
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
I like

527
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,080
The rabbit hole on that one

528
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,664
All of these are one-off documentaries that probably didn't air on

529
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Normal.

530
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,040
Who's not the host of anything

531
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,856
Currently

532
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Currently

533
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
Tater on a lot offers

534
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,656
I got a lot of offer I guarantee you drop everything we like David Knight you're in

535
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
You take over the show for the neck

536
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Next two weeks I'm going to go shoot

537
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
Some stuff like John Cena does take time off of WWE shoot the season of that American grit show and then come

538
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:50,784
Checkfresh

539
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Sell this boner s***

540
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
Super male vitality

541
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
So also the idea that the no-gun show stuff is a narrative it's been pushed on Alex's show by Ted Nugent

542
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Goody's

543
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
I was talking about

544
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Horseshit I mostly kept that in

545
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,200
Because of the

546
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
No

547
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Alderwood

548
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
I like the idea of it

549
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Discovery

550
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
The History Channel and Ane

551
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
I'll just go to heaven be like

552
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Hey

553
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
None

554
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
3 years ago

555
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
We're going to get rid of them

556
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Why would they tell Alex

557
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Especially when they're still alive

558
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
This is like what am I made out of guns

559
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,640
There's still so many shows about guns on boys like that

560
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
Duck Dynasty

561
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
Houses just like why aren't there more

562
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
There's always there's never enough

563
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Pre-loved gun

564
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
And get this

565
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
He's not just a guy who loves gun

566
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
He is also

567
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
A prophet

568
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,144
He is also someone who proselytizes

569
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
About Gunn

570
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
I need a what

571
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Unsuccessful

572
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Not only is Alex out there is spreading the good word

573
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Bart Gunn

574
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
To his right-wing audience

575
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
He's also converting a lot of dumb dumb liberals

576
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
Do you happen to have television shows on HBO

577
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
That's right

578
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Check this s*** out

579
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Wait a second

580
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,024
You get up once not twice

581
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,288
Wish app

582
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
50 calls you name it

583
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
I took the cast of Silicon Valley

584
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,136
And

585
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,888
1112

586
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,552
Martin Starr

587
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
A satisfying conversion

588
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
The people becoming

589
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
It's just weird until I shot and it was fun

590
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,120
Bulls eyes and stuff

591
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
Why shouldn't have trusted I'm not bad

592
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Sounds like a male

593
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Marquis women

594
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
What yeah

595
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,768
Cuz I said

596
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
This is a classic misunderstanding that Alex is having

597
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Because he's unwilling to

598
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Engaged

599
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
The reality is that the arguments

600
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Set 10 minute abs

601
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
About

602
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Self-defense

603
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Classes and guns

604
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Stuff like that is

605
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Hey

606
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
Let's focus on the real problem which is Manor assaulting

607
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
As opposed to

608
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,296
Making the responsibility

609
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
Fight them off or shoot them

610
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
The reality is that safe

611
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Would be fine with people being armed

612
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,816
But would rather focus on the issue that is at

613
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
The core

614
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
Be fine with only women

615
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Millers

616
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Much lower in

617
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
A violent crime

618
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Convicted of domestic

619
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,392
Abuse and then go on to

620
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
So now that we've

621
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
Convicted

622
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Have those issues in the past

623
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Almost

624
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:33,152
End up shooting people and committing violent crimes almost always have domestic

625
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,528
Whether it's against the partner or a mother or a sibling or something attracts always

626
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Morrow

627
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
40% of venture

628
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Immediately

629
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,744
Ourselves that don't live TARC.

630
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Holyshit

631
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
Do you believe that for a second

632
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:03,104
I love first

633
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
Image

634
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Zach Woods

635
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,736
Martin Starr

636
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Kumail

637
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
TJ

638
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
All going out

639
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Blow-ups

640
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Tannerite

641
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Hangout

642
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
And then they leave

643
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,912
And Mike Judge and Alex Jones sit around have a beer and talk about how great it is to

644
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Post-coital beer that there haven't so amazing

645
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
I like that idea

646
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
Cuz that's the world he lives in in his head

647
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
I'm going to guess

648
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
Probably

649
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
That did it did happen

650
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,624
The Silicon Valley cast members maybe not all of them

651
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm going to guess that

652
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
And Alex is so

653
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
Incredibly

654
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
Also clearly was drinking

655
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
That they probably like

656
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Oh yeah it is fun

657
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
Sound like

658
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:12,480
It's a weird situation still being polite

659
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:18,368
You know what if I had more time to research I would have contacted them before time

660
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
Search

661
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
The other there's

662
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Exact words a lot

663
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,592
What are you doing Dad into the background power of Zach Woods

664
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
Everyone else is secondary

665
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,456
He's so good in the show 2

666
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:54,208
Cuz he's playing what about you

667
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
Alex

668
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,312
Thought I had had some friends and they took me to the gun

669
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
And I get it

670
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
I I totally like I'm not anti

671
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,224
Shooting guns for leisure or sport or whatever

672
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Like

673
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
It's fun

674
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
It is really fun

675
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,856
In a safe environment but it also

676
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
What it takes over your life and

677
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
I've become so important to you I really Quest

678
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Turn that

679
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
But like

680
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Just sitting there shooting a gun at a thing

681
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
The Lakers with stick

682
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Pretty

683
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
I can't hold a gun

684
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Court order

685
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
No boys

686
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
You are

687
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,200
Slightly close-minded in that but I don't think

688
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,552
The problem there is

689
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
You can have peanuts

690
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Fun up there with a gun

691
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
I understand

692
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
I thought I thought

693
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
Before I went out

694
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,048
For him

695
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
What's what's

696
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
The show

697
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,472
Cuz I watch Mythbusters

698
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
I would be like

699
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,176
Filled with all of my testosterone

700
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
Feeling like a god able

701
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,368
Kill anything at any moment

702
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Sure that I would

703
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Would feel like that

704
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,256
But it was more like

705
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
Understand interesting but

706
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:40,704
It's a fair from here

707
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,288
Like I mean I kind of would get the same thrill out of it like a really good

708
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Slingshot

709
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,152
It is

710
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,968
Recoil laser

711
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,808
Explosion is almost like italic

712
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Like I'm doing something

713
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,488
But I mean who cares

714
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,144
I'm still going to go with such a f****** like

715
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
I don't know

716
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
I'm trying to do like a real irrational version

717
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
But

718
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Because I

719
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
Sincerely where I like

720
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Reasonable here

721
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:31,136
Spell know

722
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Pretty hot though

723
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,840
How about you drop some super-predator language

724
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,472
How about you

725
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
Defeat George.

726
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,848
Why is it not okay for me to be

727
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
Like reasonably okay with guns

728
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
Tulsa

729
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
Controls should be

730
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
You're doing is a real

731
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
In the same way that there's a lot of different

732
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
The alt left

733
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,071
Is thrown around by idiots

734
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
In the same way that Centrist can be thrown around by

735
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
It's very reasonable

736
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Alright

737
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
And I'm not going to

738
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
And take it away for

739
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,735
Exit away from you

740
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
Probably

741
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
He's probably should have

742
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:43,071
Glad we found, correct

743
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Start over

744
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,567
I was just really offensive about a whole bunch

745
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
First of all the schools

746
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
Lesbian

747
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Here's how you

748
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,367
Perform fellatio

749
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,167
Just join us just mesh with us just

750
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,959
Because the men aren't being met

751
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,079
Iran girl

752
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
Muscle

753
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
Muscle

754
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
God I wish

755
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
You f****** pilot

756
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,327
F****** gun

757
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
2 hours

758
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,335
Call Rebecca Gunn 50 caliber rifle

759
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,735
Quarter pound charge

760
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
We're shooting center box nerds floating

761
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
Biking barbaric energy Rises

762
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,847
Your phone calls

763
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
A f******

764
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
I love his style of his argument

765
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
That chauvinism is

766
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,159
No matter

767
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Like that

768
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
Bestie is you there

769
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
What are what are you doing

770
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,799
I can't judge for being chauvinist but lesbians are like because they don't

771
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
You're an idiot

772
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,735
Attracted to other women

773
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,295
Clarify one thing

774
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,415
Details about being a pool hall and lesbian hitting on his friend's girlfriend

775
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Conservative estimate

776
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
25 *

777
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
On the shelf that I've heard

778
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Yeah but

779
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Each time is a new

780
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Nope

781
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,447
Exactly the same story all the same details

782
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,591
25 women have had 25 of his friends

783
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Girlfriend

784
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
Entirely not possible

785
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
I don't know why it took us a long time

786
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Tannerite is

787
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Explosives

788
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,447
You're like a box of it and you put it

789
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,007
Down

790
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Explosion

791
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
So it's just the way of it's like a firework

792
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Can shoot

793
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,015
Kind of weird I didn't know what it was

794
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:51,135
Until I looked it up

795
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,743
He's talking about shooting these these logs and they blow up in cinder blocks

796
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
A little bit of a pause

797
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,631
I want to remind everybody that on a show that we did a couple months back

798
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
You talkin about being out

799
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Shooting with Mike Judge

800
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Hitting some Tannerite with

801
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Cinder block

802
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,335
Had a piece of the cinderblock Cat in the Hat

803
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Right

804
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663
Which is one of the things that we suspect may have

805
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
Cause some brain damage

806
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,247
Yeah so he's glorifying this

807
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
Like being out there shooting and all that

808
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
Not realizing on another show

809
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
He's talked about like

810
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
I got hit in the head with

811
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
Maybe it's not all good fun

812
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,279
I'm doubling back on my position even

813
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,327
But if you're not safe and not careful

814
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,423
Even recreational shooting is not good

815
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
The same time

816
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
What is drunk

817
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:41,055
Silicon Valley

818
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Zonked in the head

819
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
Remembers is that the castle

820
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Silicon Valley love guns

821
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:51,039
Now he is just a man with a very serious

822
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
Singapore

823
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:00,255
Mike Judge

824
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
I just love

825
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Zach

826
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
What

827
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447
He's right improv4humans podcast

828
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Justice

829
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
Superfly

830
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:15,615
If I was out there shooting as a member of Silicon Valley

831
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Shoots of tannerite

832
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
All of a sudden black

833
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,903
This is the best around

834
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
Great

835
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,791
All the time

836
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Shoot that one

837
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Read that one

838
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,799
Walk a little closer

839
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,455
Eclipse so far but this next clip is where it gets a little bit.

840
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
October 12th

841
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
Involves

842
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
David Clarke

843
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,439
Why do we have such because there's this whole Sheriff movement

844
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,583
Started reading about the constitutional

845
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:15,007
Die I mean

846
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:21,407
Go to the gun range with Alex and have a piece of cinder block

847
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:27,807
What's happened

848
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,047
We we haven't really talked about it but

849
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Himself

850
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,935
I don't give a fuk

851
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,311
He dies now self parked against

852
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,383
Twisting things there is a 19

853
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
15

854
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Supreme Court decision

855
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
About pardon

856
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,807
That may come into play that's actually kind of interesting

857
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
I'm not entirely sure I read

858
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
The Supreme Court decision

859
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
I said who was a journalist

860
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
He was trying to be

861
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Compelled to give up his

862
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
He had and

863
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
He got pardoned

864
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
By the president

865
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
In an attempt

866
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
For them to be like you are not going to be charged you can give up your source

867
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
Yeah and he refused the pardon

868
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
Randolph County Jail

869
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,639
And so the precedent that was set was that you can refuse a pardon

870
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,943
And agreeing to a party

871
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
You have admitted.

872
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Piece of it

873
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
Been in this is sort of disputed law that even to this day

874
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
But there is a sense

875
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
And there is

876
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
Supreme Court decisions.

877
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,863
Very very rarely do I look back at any Supreme Court decision from that

878
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
Era

879
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
Nine judges

880
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
Presidents that are set

881
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,967
An argument that can be made by Joe Arpaio

882
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
Accepting the party

883
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,575
Because it is a choice you can reject or accept a pardon

884
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
Bionicle

885
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Yeah he did already

886
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,695
Bikes

887
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
In the matter

888
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,607
Louis

889
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
Arms and legs possible

890
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
F****** torso

891
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Yeah

892
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:27,359
It's unclear whether or not that will hold up or is that the route things are going to go but

893
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
Mandu I hope so

894
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:34,271
God also people need to go back and listen to our episode about the dentist Montgomery invest

895
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
Cuz I really think

896
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,343
That there's more going on

897
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Interim

898
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
Of the Alex Jones

899
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Joe Arpaio

900
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Donald Trump

901
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
Nexus

902
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
That

903
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
People are not

904
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
Paying attention to

905
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
I think Dennis Montgomery Pleasant

906
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
Along with the births

907
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
Certificate s***

908
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
Defect

909
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
Dennis Montgomery is so

910
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Entwined

911
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
If Donald Trump

912
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
Belief that Obama was spying on

913
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
It doesn't

914
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
It's not a small thing

915
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
People should really go back

916
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
Analyze some of that stuff

917
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Also we did that episode like what 5 months

918
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,559
Everyone else I wish everyone else

919
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Totally

920
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Everyone else

921
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,655
Is f****** piling on and getting 1,000

922
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,151
The world is flawed

923
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,967
That's our main issue with Joe Arpaio right

924
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
We're not getting it up

925
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,367
I'll let myself out my ego take a backseat let's just deal with him

926
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,647
I can't

927
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
I can't I

928
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,071
It's really not high on the list of all the worst things that are happy

929
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Open right now

930
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
Dial Harvey

931
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,471
Arpaio

932
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
80 year old man

933
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
Bright doesn't mean that much

934
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
In the grand scheme

935
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
You know it really doesn't

936
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,247
That's just one of those demoralizing fuc

937
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
Nothing matters

938
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
These guys

939
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
Everything

940
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
They can just

941
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,951
Act with impunity

942
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
And what can you or I do

943
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,791
It sends a profoundly bad

944
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
Because

945
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,679
I think the worst part about it I mean

946
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Is really really

947
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
Depressing

948
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
Is that

949
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
Trump phrases in frame today

950
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,967
He he got a witch-hunt against them for doing his job

951
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Yeah

952
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
Means that the application is all the atrocities you committed was

953
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,695
That was a job

954
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,095
His job was to arrest every Latino person

955
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Sweep

956
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,191
I'm sure I'd like the stories that are coming out even

957
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
And I recently liked

958
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
People who have been

959
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:09,151
Let me tell you what happened with me

960
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,199
Donald Trump

961
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,735
Fuckgod Mike zullo

962
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:17,343
Arya Stark list

963
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
God dammit man

964
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,191
I've never seen you as someone else but the why would I know if you

965
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
It's about

966
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,103
How Barack Obama

967
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,199
All the time

968
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,759
That's why I be so long

969
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,319
A co-host is no one

970
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
Stop it

971
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,719
This is about how Obama went

972
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
To Oregon

973
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,095
After that shooting that happened like a week or so back in the timeline now

974
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,399
Like a present

975
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
David Clarke

976
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,031
When you get back on the other side I'll explain

977
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
Why these thoughts are deeply troubling

978
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,151
Helpless jackasses

979
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
Marble America

980
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
The house

981
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:29,023
Pictures when a collective pile but stupid

982
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,351
Operator

983
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:37,983
30 * the tragedy that happened the United States

984
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,567
To see what he can accomplish on his agenda and then I think that this

985
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
Saturday

986
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
Erase all right through it that's why I said I'm glad they did it

987
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,991
Respect for the president

988
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,207
To achieve a political agenda I'm glad to see that

989
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:04,607
Do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do president

990
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:10,239
With the armed Secret Service security staff

991
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
Can it

992
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
What's repost judges clip

993
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:21,503
The article about Obama

994
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
And I want you to

995
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,391
He's going to go viral

996
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,207
Everybody picked it up

997
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
What is the communicator to get aggressive

998
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
We have to counter them

999
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,447
Update Obama give up your guns

1000
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
Farm Obama

1001
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
The here's why that clip is

1002
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Particularly troubling

1003
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
You have

1004
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
Sheriff Clarke

1005
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
On television

1006
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
Making the same point

1007
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
And Matt Drudge

1008
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,063
On episode like a week back

1009
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,391
Now here is the part that's even more troubling

1010
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,439
Cuz that would be f***** up on its own

1011
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
Do you have this

1012
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Sheriff I don't know why

1013
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,071
National Television

1014
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:13,471
The President should have his security removed or whatever

1015
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,799
I think that it's getting crazy in and of itself

1016
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
But

1017
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
About a month or two

1018
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
I think 2 months after this

1019
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
Sheriff Clarke was in Russia

1020
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,063
Sheriff Clarke

1021
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,647
He went along

1022
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
There's

1023
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,023
That can't be an okay thing

1024
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
What's the most

1025
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
He was in Russia at the

1026
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
The same time that Michael Flynn was in Russia

1027
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
The reason he was there was

1028
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
Because he was part of an

1029
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
An NRA delegation

1030
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
There went over there

1031
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,135
With this gentleman named

1032
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
Ruggles

1033
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Dimitri Rogan

1034
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
He's a Hardline Deputy to Vladimir Putin

1035
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
The head of Russia

1036
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
Defense industry of longtime opponent of American power

1037
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
Because of his

1038
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,079
Role in the invasion of Crimea

1039
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Eastern Ukraine

1040
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Sheriff Clarke

1041
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,479
Along with some other folks

1042
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,039
Who are supergun positive Folk

1043
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,575
I went over it

1044
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Which

1045
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
They claim

1046
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Was just because

1047
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
He's integon

1048
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,791
Like I don't know I don't think that

1049
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Yeah

1050
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:48,959
Most high-powered

1051
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
We love guns

1052
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
He loves guns

1053
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
There's definitely nothing to look into now everybody look up the Alexander

1054
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,719
I represent was the leader of the ultra-right party called rodina or motherland

1055
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:16,607
And famously believes in the restoration of the Russian Empire include

1056
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Which is to say Alaska

1057
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,191
Control of the party

1058
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,519
From a party that was occasionally in opposition

1059
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,823
Who is strictly pro-putin party

1060
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,407
His party miscalculated Putin

1061
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,687
Anti-immigrant mood

1062
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,015
I got kicked out of the parliament for a chauvinistic promotion video

1063
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
It said let's clean the garbage

1064
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,903
Featuring Central Asian workers eating a watermelon and spitting on the ground

1065
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
Wow

1066
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
Racially

1067
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
Then Putin

1068
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,959
This is the guy who David Clark

1069
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
Went over and met with

1070
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
In Russia

1071
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
2 months after he's telling

1072
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Obama

1073
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
To give up his gun

1074
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
And Alex is saying

1075
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Yeah

1076
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Alright

1077
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
Triangulation

1078
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,295
At least in terms of people were making the exact same

1079
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,903
In Matt drudge Alex Jones and David Clarke

1080
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,207
If that is a

1081
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
Writable problem

1082
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,535
For all of them

1083
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
For all of them

1084
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,959
No apparently they are f******

1085
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
If you can

1086
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
If you can pardon Arpaio

1087
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Who is

1088
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Really under any kind of

1089
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687
Threat now

1090
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
The point was

1091
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
I can do whatever the f*** I want

1092
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,575
And laws don't mean anything

1093
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
As long as you're my friend

1094
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Tire problem

1095
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
With the monarchy

1096
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,535
Which apparently is what we are

1097
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,071
What's going on

1098
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Why

1099
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
Buhay Amerika

1100
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:03,615
It's amazing how much they despise America

1101
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
They hate

1102
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,295
He bought a lot of the Constitution

1103
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Amendment

1104
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Second Amendment right

1105
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,647
Don't have any f****** clue what the words are

1106
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:26,143
There's some great old videos of Sam Cedar going out to like libertarian marches and asking people about the Constitution

1107
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,471
Amazing like

1108
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,031
Well I haven't

1109
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,639
Planning your other Constitution

1110
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,783
I wanted to just read this quote to because this I think

1111
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
This is aboard this from that same article

1112
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,671
It's disconcerting that they would be meeting with a Russian official about anything

1113
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
Given their vocal support of the

1114
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
They're talking about Donald Trump

1115
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
Intelligent

1116
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,887
Which is investigating brushes

1117
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,167
Text influence the 20s

1118
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
16 presidential election

1119
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Due to the NRA's opposition

1120
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
The sanction

1121
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,335
It defies credulity

1122
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,383
And their extraordinary support

1123
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Donald Trump

1124
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
So

1125
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,479
You kind of get the Sun

1126
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
That they were over there

1127
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
In some sort of

1128
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Wink-wink-nudge-nudge

1129
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
Exactly

1130
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,999
Already

1131
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,399
The sheriff

1132
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,215
Is responsible for a lot of deaths

1133
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:38,847
I didn't think

1134
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,479
Doterra in f******

1135
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,759
The Philippines where it's like

1136
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
Disco murder people who do drugs

1137
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:52,159
Just where everybody sells drugs

1138
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,183
You want your fine

1139
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,767
Constitutional Sheriff strike Mesa

1140
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,071
Mid-range Generals in a junta

1141
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,655
Yeah military

1142
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
They think that they know whatever one wants

1143
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
And it is not

1144
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,615
David's

1145
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
Are two of the most

1146
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
Awful people

1147
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Imagine

1148
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
I never morsel

1149
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,855
I think an image

1150
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
A picture of started to be

1151
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
Become clear

1152
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,975
Is that there are a lot of people

1153
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,047
That are either actively working with Russia

1154
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
David Clarke

1155
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,119
And people who are

1156
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Being

1157
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Duke

1158
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
By Russian influence

1159
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
And propaganda

1160
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Matt Drudge

1161
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Alex Jones

1162
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,847
Matt drudge is influencing whether he's actually like

1163
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383
He knows what he's doing

1164
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
I can't tell I have no

1165
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Hayden influence

1166
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,575
Yeah but I certainly

1167
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
God knows what he's doing

1168
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
Ouch

1169
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,183
I'm at Matt drudge I have no idea

1170
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
But they're all saying the same

1171
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Nothing

1172
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
The f****** problem

1173
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,303
Because

1174
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
It is

1175
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
Talking point

1176
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
And a narrative

1177
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
Is clearly coming out of Russia

1178
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,447
So

1179
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
Let's hope

1180
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:17,407
House intelligence intelligence committee

1181
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
Are going to figure this thing out

1182
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
And they're just going to Georgia

1183
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
I didn't expect any of

1184
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:31,231
No I think it's I think it's so f***** up where we're at

1185
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
Go through all this because I

1186
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,935
Pecan like

1187
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,775
A lot of

1188
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,079
One of the ways that people are saying that

1189
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,127
We're deflecting from the fact

1190
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
That Hillary didn't go to work

1191
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
God dammit

1192
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Donald Trump

1193
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:05,023
Is on tape peeing on the way like there's not much else to say this

1194
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Other than that

1195
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:14,495
There is like I might genuinely believe that one can really exploit media

1196
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
Trick people

1197
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,639
Is following along with the ID

1198
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
One of the games

1199
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,015
The propagandists play

1200
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
Is

1201
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,599
Tricking you into thinking that two things can't be

1202
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
Be true

1203
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,183
Hillary should have gone to Wisconsin

1204
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,767
True

1205
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,303
That's also true

1206
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,607
Those both can be true

1207
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,399
They aren't mutually exclusive at all

1208
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,703
But the way that everything is presented

1209
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,727
2 tricks you into thinking

1210
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:52,639
If you believe your excuse

1211
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,199
Who cares

1212
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
It's so much it's so much

1213
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
Twitter take

1214
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,599
Kulture

1215
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:07,743
Recording is over the weekend and last night I was monitoring that hurricane Harvey hit

1216
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
Culture

1217
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
I'm f****** done

1218
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:16,447
Yeah real time with the actual natural disaster happen

1219
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Was just so f****** distasteful

1220
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
Just people making jokes

1221
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
Stuff

1222
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
Just collapsed if people are stuck inside of right now people to get out

1223
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
It's weird.

1224
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
To watch

1225
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Laugh

1226
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Because

1227
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,367
And it's super weird all across the board because

1228
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
That we are

1229
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
Vehemently

1230
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,999
SMS

1231
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
Like I'm screaming about

1232
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
Arpaio's

1233
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,471
It isn't actually affecting

1234
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,031
No

1235
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
I mean but not yet I don't feel like this

1236
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
Personal effects

1237
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,687
Go home

1238
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,479
Anything that I've done has been chained

1239
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Being pardoned

1240
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
In the same way that

1241
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
It is

1242
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,183
Think of all the damage that is being done

1243
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
While we are talking

1244
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:16,863
I just thought you know you just feel like a certain amount of Disconnect from it if you're watching

1245
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Through your phone

1246
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,703
And that to me is why it makes sense

1247
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,007
Sunset the twittersphere can

1248
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Just

1249
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Do all of this b*******

1250
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
Because it doesn't even look real it looks like you're watching it on TV

1251
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,039
It's a real Disaster Movie

1252
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,207
So we're going to get political issues

1253
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
Clip

1254
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
Alex Jones go to the phone

1255
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Just a dumb

1256
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,399
Dumb f****** caller

1257
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:53,727
Let's go to Louisiana

1258
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,287
Hey cowboy

1259
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,847
I just wanted to let you know that

1260
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,407
You can be the first to know that I'm no longer racist

1261
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,551
And I can prove it by level

1262
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
Can I do have a color

1263
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
And we found out what color it is

1264
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,023
And it happens to be eggshell beige

1265
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:23,423
Home Improvement in my wallet

1266
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
Right behind my

1267
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,311
Right behind my drivers license in the so I'm a person of color now

1268
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,967
My piggy bank

1269
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,767
I guess anybody can say anything about that

1270
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
Sorry

1271
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
Bright

1272
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,911
He goes on to talk about social security

1273
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
I just

1274
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,543
Wish we didn't have to live in the same country as these people pretty wild

1275
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Some somewhere else

1276
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,639
How about this

1277
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:08,223
If you're if you're

1278
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
We put you in

1279
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,367
What about the pro wrestler Umaga

1280
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,159
Arizona

1281
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,303
The temperature is always 150

1282
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:28,703
I'm not going to respond to this just cuz I know you're joking but I don't want to play this game anymore

1283
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,263
I don't know anymore mean either no one is driving

1284
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,151
Me neither

1285
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
That's a weird twist

1286
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
An address that is not weird at all

1287
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,599
This Mexico

1288
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
You ruined your own transition there

1289
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,799
Just becomes a verbal tic

1290
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,967
Physically

1291
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,647
I tell you I don't

1292
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,791
In the New World

1293
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
So

1294
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,143
He's talking about how like our government funds Isis

1295
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,983
And the only ones are really taken care of

1296
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Expression

1297
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:43,199
Better than us

1298
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
I'm just

1299
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
Yeah

1300
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,671
Clearview has a profoundly pro-russia propuso

1301
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
Perspective

1302
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
You know what

1303
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
You know what I have

1304
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
Like okay

1305
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,911
So they all hate the world government yada yada yada apun

1306
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,935
Right sir

1307
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,239
So if we do

1308
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
Alex

1309
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,567
And f*** it

1310
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,127
Let's just throw that in the real

1311
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:16,223
Call Melissa or whatever it is

1312
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
Expansion

1313
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
Exactly he wants the old Soviet Union

1314
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
And apparently

1315
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,071
You know

1316
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Mad Max is coming around the corner

1317
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,703
If

1318
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
Nationalism

1319
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
And there is no

1320
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
You know

1321
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,895
Negotiating bodies

1322
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,943
Between these countries there is no United

1323
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Nations or anything like

1324
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
What

1325
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Like

1326
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:57,695
Do we still trade do we get news from these other places or is it like just everything off and shut it down

1327
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
Be strong countries

1328
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
Exploiting poor country

1329
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
Eat to a greater extent than we even do now

1330
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
It would be better

1331
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
Most countries that don't have something to offer

1332
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
They Don't Really ever discuss

1333
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:23,039
In terms of like this world

1334
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,831
Right it's not like

1335
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,159
I know that borders mean something in terms of like

1336
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,975
Here's America

1337
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,023
The end of the day they are a loser

1338
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
It's not really real

1339
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,399
We all are on this orb

1340
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
That we're living on

1341
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,263
And you can't look we can't all survive unless we work together

1342
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,335
I bet recognition is why there are those body

1343
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Eva

1344
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,663
Piece of the f****** thing that drives me crazy

1345
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,967
It's the same thing with the central bank

1346
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,503
And Federal Reserve

1347
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,295
If you really look

1348
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,575
The history of

1349
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
Our economy

1350
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,647
Everything has been much

1351
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Better

1352
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
Since the Federal Reserve

1353
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,327
That will come back up

1354
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
I think not.

1355
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
Yeah

1356
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,543
Federal Reserve

1357
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
And it is still

1358
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
A profit business

1359
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,967
More closely than they are

1360
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
And we should

1361
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Expectmore

1362
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,807
But if you look pack

1363
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,343
That we were way worse

1364
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
Do you win is not perfect

1365
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
We can go back

1366
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:38,815
Countless examples of atrocities that have gone on on their watch

1367
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:43,935
Rolanda

1368
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:48,287
Any number of the X tomato tomahto anytime any number of time

1369
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,079
That the International Community had

1370
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
Responsibility

1371
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
2 stops

1372
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,407
From happening and failed

1373
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
For whatever reason

1374
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
That said

1375
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,039
There are a number that would have happened

1376
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Cause those bodies

1377
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,439
I just don't understand

1378
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:09,791
I understand paranoia I understand fear I do get those things

1379
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,583
But I don't understand

1380
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
Sweet denial

1381
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
Of the posit

1382
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,959
That part really does not make sense

1383
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
But that's

1384
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
But they don't want

1385
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,127
Don't have any interest in

1386
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
That

1387
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,199
Right so

1388
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Yeah

1389
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,319
Reno genocides happening on localized levels and

1390
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
They want

1391
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,695
Iran currency

1392
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,511
I completely fluctuating stock markets

1393
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
To the point where

1394
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607
Like everything is Fox all the time

1395
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
But

1396
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,935
It's this it's the entirety of

1397
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,727
The GOP it's the way that their brains were

1398
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Isleta

1399
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
Terra Vista

1400
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,591
Cuz it's not working the way we want it to

1401
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,199
And then they don't do that thing of like okay well then what do we build after

1402
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,735
They have no idea

1403
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,831
Like always

1404
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
As much as we can

1405
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,903
And then they never say okay

1406
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,231
Well since we don't have any money for the Federal

1407
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,047
What is it that we keep and what is it that we get rid of

1408
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,447
And you're like well we prove

1409
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Will do

1410
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,615
Never any sense of what are we building

1411
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,663
The better they have no interest in that

1412
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,711
Because the people

1413
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,855
Are the ones who are going to profit the most

1414
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
If you tear down this

1415
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,207
I'm privatized everything

1416
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
Yeah

1417
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,535
They would we

1418
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,815
The dumbest

1419
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
Weakest

1420
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,399
Most idiotic members of our population

1421
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
Telling them that

1422
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,287
Look at all of these things that aren't helping you as much as you want them

1423
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
They've convinced

1424
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
Alex Jones

1425
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,831
As opposed to the real

1426
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Exactly

1427
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Which is

1428
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:16,767
Maybe we should explore another time Brilliance psychological

1429
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,071
Like they have pulled off

1430
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,375
A war against the poor

1431
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
Making the poor think that

1432
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
There

1433
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
On the right side

1434
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
I'd like

1435
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,223
Hang up on himself about that too but

1436
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
Michael

1437
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:06,431
So Sam had a good point about Alex Jones that is

1438
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:11,551
Ryder in the movies

1439
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,599
It's in the gossip rags

1440
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:18,207
If you were

1441
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
Some of these super rich

1442
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,791
People who have

1443
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,327
Stinky Pinky

1444
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
All that

1445
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
What you would want

1446
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,239
To create someone like Alex Jones

1447
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,263
To distract everybody

1448
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,407
Best thing possible would be to create an Alex Jones

1449
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,711
And I don't think that's the case

1450
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,295
But someone created him as controlled opposition

1451
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,575
But it is interesting

1452
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
Accidentally

1453
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
Play he is serving

1454
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,719
The greatest purpose towards us not progressing

1455
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,999
It's fast

1456
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,023
He is doing

1457
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,839
Everything possible to make sure that all the stuff

1458
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
Says he wants

1459
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:02,239
Never comes about everything is afraid of War

1460
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:08,639
Fulfilling prophecy in this regard especially for self-medicating Friday

1461
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,455
Yeah except he's the one who's making sure that all the

1462
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Doesn't happen

1463
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,503
Yeah

1464
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,367
Because the billionaires can pay so many people to do this

1465
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,647
Like they don't even need

1466
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,951
They have Heritage Foundation

1467
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:28,095
They have billionaires they don't work for us

1468
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,423
If we stop calling them billionaires and start calling them oligarchy

1469
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,007
Like I said

1470
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
And we start

1471
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,919
Theft really help

1472
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,783
Billionaire

1473
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,087
Oligarch is kind of gross

1474
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,671
I don't know I think we should call him what they are

1475
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
Carpetbaggers

1476
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Globalist

1477
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,023
Oh boy

1478
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:03,679
So we like the globalist we got it stop going off on somebody

1479
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,983
Okay alright next day

1480
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
Is October 14th

1481
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,615
Cuz I'm

1482
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:17,247
No I don't okay

1483
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,391
Going to work through this thing

1484
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,999
September on October 13th

1485
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Can't stand him

1486
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,583
Yeah we move onto October 14th

1487
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,143
Paul Joseph Watson

1488
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,983
Because Alex Jones starts the show by lying about him

1489
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,175
At the train station when he gets off

1490
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,991
Everyday in the nude

1491
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:54,367
Wasn't

1492
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,671
5 years ago

1493
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
Villain Deku

1494
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
Can you criticize radicalism

1495
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:09,727
Stop saying

1496
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:16,128
Not Michael Savage from entering the United Kingdom because they believe that

1497
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,408
Beach was hate speech

1498
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,176
And it is

1499
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:18,944
Oh yeah

1500
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,712
Yeah it is

1501
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,272
It's cuz it's not criticizing radical Islam

1502
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
He talked

1503
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
Like

1504
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,624
Legitimately watched a bunch of

1505
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
Add so much of the stuff he says

1506
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,000
Is

1507
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
So aggressively

1508
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
It is

1509
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,632
Conflating Islam with

1510
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Terrorism

1511
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
To what end

1512
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:45,312
On the show but it's the worst example

1513
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,104
Was when he was on

1514
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,456
Television show he had a gay activist on the show

1515
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
He told him I hope you get AIDS

1516
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:53,760
Sendai

1517
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,296
Like legitimately

1518
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,344
He is that kind of an awful person

1519
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
So the idea

1520
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,440
He does incite people a bit

1521
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
That's the idea

1522
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,560
Totally cool

1523
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:11,424
Also the idea that you can't criticize Islam without being arrested

1524
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:14,496
You're living proof that's not true

1525
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
That's true

1526
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,152
You do it all the time and you're fine Paul Joseph Watson does it all the time he's in London he's fine

1527
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
Your whole like

1528
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,504
Either America or in England

1529
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,344
Totalitarian

1530
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,904
It's very specific to teleserye

1531
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
If you get arrested

1532
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,584
What are you talkin about what does that mean

1533
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,960
Like I don't think that's true but I also don't trust Paul Joseph

1534
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Against

1535
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,104
Whether he wanted to or not

1536
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,408
Right like I don't think that he

1537
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Has the

1538
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,528
Do not turn it into

1539
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,576
Let's burn down that mosque

1540
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Apso

1541
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,136
I mean

1542
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
When you

1543
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
Eddie your existence

1544
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,072
Is proof that your argument is wrong

1545
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
Woody

1546
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
What do you do

1547
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,472
Make the argument anyways

1548
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,288
Well I guess

1549
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:25,152
To create people about you create a fake anime

1550
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,968
Who are constantly about

1551
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
To take you down

1552
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Yeah

1553
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Just cracked the nut

1554
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
So

1555
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,440
No we have twenty more clips

1556
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Alright

1557
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,768
I'll be real quiet for the next 45 minutes

1558
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
Let's go

1559
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,936
I teased earlier in this episode

1560
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
That we met

1561
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,496
Not make progress

1562
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,640
The point where because whenever we

1563
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712
Smart

1564
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,296
So I were about to get to to get to something

1565
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
That is

1566
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
I think transformative

1567
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
And might

1568
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
A very major piece

1569
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,280
Of Alex Jones transforming into a trump propaganda

1570
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
And by the losing his mind

1571
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
He got hit by a larger

1572
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
Because

1573
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
Trying to think of another person who's on

1574
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Silicon Valley ending

1575
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
I shouldn't have thrown at 12 Alaska

1576
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:32,224
Pizza world

1577
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
In this mess

1578
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
Alex Jones

1579
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,624
Was going to get into a narrative that I sincerely think is a push

1580
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
This is a big one for him

1581
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,232
He's lying about ever

1582
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,280
Let me get to the story that

1583
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:54,496
That I spent well over an hour researching and I could

1584
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,544
Berkeley texted it to me

1585
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,944
Confederate flag supporters indicted under Georgia terrorism all

1586
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,528
Texas

1587
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,600
Federal holidays

1588
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:15,744
People getting their big four-wheel-drive trucks to drive around with rebel flag

1589
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:22,400
They do it at the beach if you're in Florida or Louisiana Chevy taxes sent me this is just what you grew up around

1590
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,728
I have a complex historical

1591
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,520
Trace add when I see it

1592
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:35,200
Because I really

1593
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,760
And I'm going to get to that.

1594
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,856
What is there free speech

1595
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,184
Confederate Battle Flag and slavery

1596
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,728
Will they take your children if you criticize the government

1597
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,288
Socialism global warming

1598
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,080
Germany

1599
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
Illegal

1600
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,784
A deposit for a second cousin

1601
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
Has been spinning for like the last

1602
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,392
Week and a half on the shower so

1603
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,696
And I've just sort of talked it by the wayside

1604
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
He thinks

1605
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,512
Germany has reactivated

1606
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,280
The Stasi

1607
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
In order

1608
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,120
To get you to never talk bad about immigrants

1609
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
Well Germany

1610
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,960
The one of the strongest

1611
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,592
Hate speech

1612
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
There is

1613
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,456
Truth to what he's saying but not what he's saying

1614
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,856
The ghetto

1615
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
Yeah

1616
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
On the show order

1617
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
Is privately about house

1618
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,560
You know if you express Nazi ideology you get arrested

1619
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,840
Yeah there

1620
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,632
That there is that sort of

1621
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
It doesn't

1622
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,216
Jibe with our ideas

1623
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
Free speech

1624
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,312
Definitely makes sense based on history

1625
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:11,712
Maybe the national law of Everett

1626
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:20,928
Send it's not terrible it's also used like it is one of those things

1627
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,976
In the same way that

1628
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
Can be used against

1629
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
People we don't like

1630
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
It can be used against people we do

1631
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,656
Lite-Brite

1632
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
The first amendment is super important

1633
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,056
It's super important The Government Can

1634
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:42,688
Make a lot of restricting your ability to say what you want

1635
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,736
Should have made it more

1636
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,016
Specific like

1637
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,856
You can say like here's a law that I would pick

1638
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Alright

1639
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Hear me out

1640
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,952
In Congress

1641
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,000
You can absolutely

1642
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
Express your right

1643
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,608
To say whatever it is

1644
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,168
And the law will not

1645
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
However

1646
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,264
It is also illegal

1647
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
To punch a Nazi in the face however men

1648
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,872
Sure

1649
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
That's a good one

1650
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,784
Did the point is there are there are these

1651
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
Elements

1652
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,600
German Society

1653
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,928
Outside of all right.

1654
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:27,744
Yeah but they're not reactivating Stasi

1655
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Flappy Bird

1656
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:37,472
Yeah Alex's Alex's going on a bunch

1657
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
You look into it it's like there's other issues

1658
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,080
Use that wasn't because they said immigrants are bad

1659
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,128
It was because they were unfit parents

1660
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,432
Other

1661
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
Narrative respond about how like

1662
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,528
If your kids playing basketball

1663
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:53,344
You had a state takes them away

1664
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,416
Yeah

1665
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:59,232
Nativity kicked into about Confederate flag

1666
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,024
People being indicted

1667
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,888
Let's listen to the rest of this Civil War revisionism

1668
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,216
The carbon tax global warming

1669
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
Of course climate change

1670
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,128
This is the Pratt got married

1671
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,688
Georgia

1672
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
Fight

1673
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:32,000
White supremacist

1674
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:36,352
It was an amazing individual

1675
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,424
Ulysses has Grant did the northern General

1676
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,752
What's wrong

1677
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
Southern perspective yes

1678
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,920
Call George

1679
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
No

1680
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:03,232
Read and understand

1681
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
Slavery

1682
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,864
President Andrew Jackson

1683
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,680
Was it about Playland

1684
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,776
His Protege sham Houston

1685
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
And was removed

1686
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
I was spit on

1687
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,016
Busy that you're being set up by British intelligence course he was right

1688
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,632
Saints Row some bottles

1689
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,752
Animal people

1690
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,544
For the rebel flag

1691
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,760
Bottles

1692
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,600
That means the black people are being racist

1693
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,160
Sprite

1694
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,696
As opposed to

1695
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,720
Gorgeous waving

1696
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,792
The rebel flag

1697
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,120
Do this and you agree 100% with Alex Jones

1698
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,400
That is restricting priest

1699
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,424
Total

1700
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,960
I can't

1701
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,336
About everything is not

1702
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,736
Because this narrative is going to be a little bigger to Robert E Lee and

1703
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,344
But he absolutely did have flight

1704
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,232
Things

1705
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
Was accused of having slaves

1706
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,632
His argument was that

1707
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,680
Gotten his when his dad died

1708
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,776
Years after I die

1709
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,056
So

1710
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,848
That was his argument was I'm going to

1711
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,872
Freedom 5 years

1712
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,920
After my dad died

1713
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
West

1714
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,480
Unfortunately the civil war broke out

1715
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
3 years later

1716
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
So

1717
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,576
Who knows that he would have freed them

1718
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
I don't know if it were me

1719
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
I would like dad's dead

1720
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,440
I don't give a s*** about his wishes

1721
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,512
If I were actually against slavery like okay

1722
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
Guys just yet

1723
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:20,192
Don't tell my dad if you'd like just don't reply

1724
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,056
You're not going to be seeing them anywhere

1725
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,336
Just on the off-chance

1726
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,616
NetSpend

1727
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,896
The other thing is

1728
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,712
You seem to in a lot of letters

1729
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,760
Have negative

1730
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
Slavery

1731
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,064
But did not

1732
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,600
Advance that position

1733
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,368
Can publicly

1734
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
I didn't

1735
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,184
Work against it at all

1736
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
Which

1737
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,744
To mine eyes means

1738
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
He wasn't really

1739
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,376
But be that as it may

1740
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
During a war about whether or not we should

1741
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
Keep slavery

1742
01:31:55,008 --> 01:32:01,152
To the argument is more complicated

1743
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,224
The black and white version of

1744
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
Of like

1745
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,784
Awful and great

1746
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,856
He's probably more in the middle and

1747
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,136
Towards awful

1748
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,928
But not as bad

1749
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
Who cares

1750
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:18,048
Look I'm not trying to be a Centrist on this to

1751
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,608
Let's put it that way

1752
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,936
The point about this

1753
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,496
People the rebel flag

1754
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
It is so much more

1755
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Who Would It Go

1756
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,176
They did so much worse yet

1757
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,712
Alex Alex

1758
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,504
Our research

1759
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
That means

1760
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,320
But he knows everything I'm about to tell you

1761
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:46,720
Pretending all that stuff didn't happen last episode

1762
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:50,048
Does this incident happened on July 27th

1763
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
2015

1764
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:57,472
Confederate flags disrupted the black child's birthday celebration

1765
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Fucksake

1766
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
Yep in Georgia

1767
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
Shouting racial slurs and deathreat partygoers said

1768
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:08,992
The entire through in pickup trucks taunting their target cell phone videos showed

1769
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,832
A second video capture the uninvited guests

1770
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
Grassy fields

1771
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,648
During Saturday's confrontation

1772
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,464
Quote it's a child's birthday party

1773
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,232
Angry Witness

1774
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,000
Just called out to them

1775
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:24,352
Partygoers claim to hecklers brandished Gunn tire iron

1776
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,424
As they threatened to quote kill all the ends

1777
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,520
New York Daily News

1778
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
Well it's

1779
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,872
That's from the media's the one

1780
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
Symbol of race

1781
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
That's from the New York Daily News

1782
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Visit from the washing

1783
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,784
The post on October 12th

1784
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
2015

1785
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:50,208
At the time of trucks drove into the neighborhood

1786
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,768
And began making threats and yelling racial slurs

1787
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,352
Call Gunn saying he was going to kill the end

1788
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:00,448
Party host Melissa Ashford told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution

1789
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,056
Quote then one of them said give me the gun all shoot them ends

1790
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,384
Okay so

1791
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
Just like

1792
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,272
Just as a barometer for how we're doing

1793
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
I have

1794
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,440
Maybe

1795
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:30,144
But

1796
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:34,240
Which is right around the time like a day or two before where we're at now

1797
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,824
2017 ascender

1798
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,128
In February 2017

1799
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
Was finalized

1800
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,504
And you'll be thrilled to know that

1801
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
The people who got charged

1802
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,808
Tried in court

1803
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,624
And I worked for them for years

1804
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,904
They got

1805
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Hard chard

1806
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
4

1807
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,280
Good activate streetgangs

1808
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,304
What

1809
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
From February twenty

1810
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:06,240
2017

1811
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
Video footage from the party

1812
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:15,200
Little more than a month after dylann roof Charleston Church Massacre

1813
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,224
Battle Flag

1814
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:20,832
1%

1815
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,880
And said he was going to kill the end

1816
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,720
Prosecutors have said that the cases against Torres

1817
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,000
Norton and other defense

1818
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,584
Defendants are not to fly the Confederate flag

1819
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,376
Put on threats against the victim

1820
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,984
Quote this is behavior that even supporters of the Confederate Battle Flag

1821
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
Can agree is Criminal

1822
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,288
It shouldn't be allowed

1823
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:44,128
Douglas County district attorney Brian Fort Myers

1824
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,944
Wow

1825
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,320
Alex's version of what's going on

1826
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
Shocking

1827
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
Man

1828
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,720
Like the the tweets

1829
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
Obama

1830
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
The most likes

1831
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,072
History of the world

1832
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,352
Oh boy

1833
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
The one in which he hits him with

1834
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
The picture

1835
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,496
Is not something that you

1836
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
You're born with it some

1837
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,592
It is almost one of those things where it's like

1838
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,688
Maybe we should take

1839
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:24,832
I don't mean maybe it is a biggish a bigger issue

1840
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
The family is

1841
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
What is

1842
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
Like it might be a better idea if

1843
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,024
It was more community-driven and less

1844
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,864
You know you're raised by whatever random ass

1845
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,424
People

1846
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:44,800
May not be a bad idea

1847
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,408
Becoming a type 1 civilization getting off-planet

1848
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:53,760
And stuff like that progress

1849
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,040
In the grander scheme

1850
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,064
Threat

1851
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,600
If you look back

1852
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,392
The history of

1853
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,696
Humanoids

1854
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,720
Human-like

1855
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,536
Ben's if you go back to Neanderthal times and

1856
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,072
Even

1857
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Human civilization

1858
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,656
Not homo sapiens

1859
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:13,216
Different patterns

1860
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,008
Of culture you see

1861
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,104
Matriarchal society

1862
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
Nevermind

1863
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,528
Bianca

1864
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Children

1865
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,392
Becomes much more Community intertwined

1866
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,952
Your children aren't your property everybody is

1867
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,536
Sort of interest in raising children

1868
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,840
Together and just because that is in the

1869
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,632
Half doesn't mean that the Farrelly

1870
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,704
But those ideas can't possibly be the future

1871
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Like

1872
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
As we

1873
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:48,032
Drift towards

1874
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,312
Massive shift

1875
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:52,128
And how we live like the idea of going off-planet

1876
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:52,896
Is crazy

1877
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,944
Like we would have to change everything

1878
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
Yeah

1879
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,552
On planet

1880
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,856
Everything's crazy

1881
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,464
Society 8:30

1882
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,280
In terms of discreet family unit

1883
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,072
And in terms of like

1884
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,376
Even in the last 50 years

1885
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,936
Chipped away a little bit

1886
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:21,312
Man runs everything in household are happening

1887
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:26,944
It's entirely possible that we do end up getting to maybe not necessarily uncle

1888
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,504
But an avuncular type of pattern

1889
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,600
It really does make the most sense when you consider yes

1890
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,904
It is important to all of us

1891
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,928
Yeah children

1892
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,488
The results of

1893
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
You know

1894
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,328
It's like whatever

1895
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,376
Get raised by horrible f****** tickets

1896
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:50,752
Who raised by horrible f****** big dick

1897
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:58,432
It's super weird that strangers children really do affect your life but

1898
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:02,016
They raise their kids

1899
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:06,112
No f****** do it do it if somebody is raising their kids

1900
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
Agree

1901
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:15,584
So these next two clips

1902
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
I'm just going

1903
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,656
Play The Alex Jones

1904
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
News about this

1905
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,960
Battle Flag situation

1906
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,056
Play these without commentary through them

1907
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,592
Screaming

1908
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Here we go

1909
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,760
Confederate flag

1910
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,040
You know

1911
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,880
They were a lot of times looking for trouble

1912
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:46,048
Bonfire whatever

1913
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,080
Shop lights

1914
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,408
What is absolutely not

1915
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,392
Because the media was invoking

1916
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,928
Anybody that's got a

1917
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,232
Confederate flag wants to murder black people

1918
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:25,472
Post office

1919
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,800
While we go get back to that narrative

1920
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,336
Circuit Court narrative

1921
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Probably worse

1922
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,760
160 years later

1923
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
After the Civil War

1924
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,976
They will arrest you and charge you for terrorism

1925
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,768
If you fly

1926
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,864
And people's feelings get hurt

1927
01:40:54,400 --> 01:41:00,032
Chic-A-Sea reportable correct

1928
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,080
When they get upset

1929
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,224
So in that Cliff use blaming

1930
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,248
The people who have

1931
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,320
I had racial slurs

1932
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,856
Dudes with guns

1933
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,136
Pipes and knives

1934
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,928
Rolling through with

1935
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,744
Standard Lee racist

1936
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
They were just

1937
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:26,912
Shoes that shouldn't be there just triggered shouldn't

1938
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,984
Birthday parties

1939
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,008
You're like

1940
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,848
Snowflake North all of another problem children's birthday

1941
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,616
Sofrito

1942
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,152
Truth I know

1943
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:45,088
Children parties all the time right and I go in there and no one wants to debate

1944
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:48,416
What's going on you f****** cowards

1945
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
Ridiculous

1946
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,280
It is an interesting

1947
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,816
It is an interesting thing

1948
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
That's

1949
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,448
No I just I'm just thinking like

1950
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,776
Are we still at war with the Confederacy

1951
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:07,616
I think some of them think that you got

1952
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,640
Stranded inland

1953
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:15,040
In Vietnam or South Korea years after

1954
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
Or in that same

1955
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
It is

1956
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,960
It is an issue

1957
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:36,032
Anytime you fly the Confederate flag it is a problem

1958
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,384
It is a symbol of owning people

1959
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:43,200
This that's what the Confederate flag is.

1960
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:48,832
I agree but this comes down to what we were talking about earlier with the downsides of complete free speech

1961
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
Yeah because

1962
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,416
In countries like Germany where they can

1963
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,208
Shut it down real hard

1964
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,000
I'll make it at like 1

1965
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
The Civil War was over

1966
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,584
We probably shouldn't have been as generous

1967
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
And be like oh

1968
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
Yeah

1969
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,288
Or whatever

1970
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
No

1971
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,104
You need to be punished

1972
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,128
For your

1973
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
Is your sins

1974
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,688
Right

1975
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
Weave

1976
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,992
Except free speech

1977
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,272
To such a degree to be like

1978
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,320
Review nothing's been around

1979
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,488
Did maybe they weren't called neo-nazis

1980
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,256
With neo-Nazi

1981
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
Is there a lot of them

1982
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,072
Yeah and we just like

1983
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,520
Believe to them

1984
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
Building up

1985
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,128
Imenu360

1986
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,456
You think if you go the other way though

1987
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,784
You know WWII Treaty of Versailles

1988
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,552
You just

1989
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,624
Destroy a people until they want to start another f****** War

1990
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,768
What has to be defeated with some sort of

1991
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
Positive

1992
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,328
You can't see any positive

1993
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,120
Whenever you talk about

1994
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
People who

1995
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,656
Udet

1996
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:08,704
Like

1997
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,752
Alex Jones

1998
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,568
As people who are pedophiles

1999
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,128
Montpelier

2000
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:20,224
Like how do how do you combat that with

2001
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Positivity

2002
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Like that

2003
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344
It's a it's an insane idea

2004
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,000
Positive

2005
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,816
I am explaining truth

2006
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
I don't know

2007
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,984
I love take every opportunity

2008
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,568
My steps today I'm doing great

2009
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:50,688
This next clip Obama is mentally ill

2010
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,480
But he also says something

2011
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
Things that I think is

2012
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,600
Investigation

2013
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
There's a trump

2014
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,928
Tweet for every occasion every

2015
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,976
Every time we go back to 2015

2016
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
And

2017
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,536
He describes Obama

2018
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,584
All the stuff that he hates about Obama

2019
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,424
Yeah Obama was none of that

2020
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,824
The guy is the president because he's not black

2021
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,176
More important part about it

2022
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,016
It was something else that comes up in this clip

2023
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:29,600
I think it's profoundly important

2024
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,072
MIT scientists

2025
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:43,168
Are the fathers of Modern Warfare at the Pentagon

2026
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,288
So dr. pechenik

2027
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
Is about

2028
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
To show up

2029
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,128
Is this

2030
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,944
I think he's been on the show years in the past

2031
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,248
But he has not been on

2032
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,296
In this entire run that we've been doing

2033
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
And I checked

2034
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,136
2014 I didn't have a answers from him

2035
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,952
But I think he had before

2036
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
But

2037
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,072
He has not been around

2038
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,632
Counter-coup narrative has not come up

2039
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
Okay

2040
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
Steve pieczenik

2041
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,240
Is about to show up on the Alex Jones Show

2042
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,288
Cuz whatever Alex says

2043
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,568
I'm going to get them on

2044
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,152
So we can expect that

2045
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,456
The bigger piece I want to take away from

2046
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,504
Is it if you're dumb

2047
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
Like Alex G

2048
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Orbitz

2049
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:38,976
No you're still smarter than Alex Jones in with it

2050
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,000
If

2051
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,536
Berries

2052
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Who is an

2053
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,608
Psych Warfare

2054
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,192
Don't make them a regular guest on your show

2055
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,496
Because you

2056
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:56,896
You're not you're not smart enough to know if they're committing Psych

2057
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:07,904
This guy psychological warfare

2058
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:13,536
Game like I've said many times

2059
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:16,096
My theory is that everyone is lying to Alec

2060
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:19,424
Weatherby Russian media Rodger Stone

2061
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
All of this guest

2062
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
And influences

2063
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,336
Is are basically tricking him into this box that he put himself in

2064
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,616
That ended up

2065
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:31,200
Being a very large part of why we have

2066
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,480
Yeah so

2067
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,016
I see that

2068
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:38,368
And like this recognition and admission is thought like

2069
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,792
The guy who is going to tell us about psych ward

2070
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:50,400
Hold on

2071
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:56,800
Is this dude ever not Warfare in psychically

2072
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:04,480
He's going to tell us all about

2073
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,528
Alright

2074
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,600
Don't do it

2075
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:16,000
It drives me crazy like I just put in the fact that he

2076
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:16,768
Recognizes

2077
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:19,328
And gives him like part of his credit

2078
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,864
Means that he knows

2079
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,936
He's not guarding himself nearly well enough

2080
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,240
Like if you know how it we've talked about this like

2081
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
Months and months

2082
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
A lot of the times

2083
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,104
Sonic does the very rash

2084
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:34,176
And whenever he's talking about

2085
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,528
Cannot allow Gorsuch to be on the Supreme Court you the neocon

2086
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Elizabeth

2087
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:45,952
Right but then you have to remember the also doesn't believe it's real

2088
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,744
A hundred other like

2089
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,536
Really terrible things

2090
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,072
But what does

2091
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,752
Exact and believe

2092
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,872
Evidently

2093
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,272
Alex ripping its troops different sides of the same point

2094
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
No that is

2095
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,088
Great question

2096
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
You made is that

2097
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,232
Once you once you have that as his credit

2098
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
I am

2099
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,816
Anything that he says in public

2100
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
You cannot believe

2101
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,728
Andy

2102
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,288
To the point where things Beast

2103
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
They have no other

2104
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,128
Are just taken as gospel

2105
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,968
That's a real f*****-up

2106
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,528
Headspace to be dangerous to give anybody

2107
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:47,136
Especially when it's like Warfare person is coming on your show

2108
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:47,904
Giving you stuff

2109
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,696
It feeds into your confirmation bias

2110
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,488
You really should analyze

2111
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,768
Now it's never does

2112
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,048
You just like

2113
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:54,816
Steve

2114
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
You think I'm funny

2115
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,400
Always wanted people to think I'm funny

2116
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:01,984
I don't know why they never do

2117
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:08,640
That's self-reflective Alex Jones at that character does not exist

2118
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
This context drop

2119
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,736
I just think it's a fence

2120
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
Women

2121
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Vix

2122
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:27,584
You got to be a slave about women's lib

2123
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:31,680
Do you like being treated like an adult

2124
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,960
I got to take the draft

2125
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,032
Service

2126
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:46,272
Women would be

2127
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
Because that

2128
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,672
Chauvinist and assholes always make it

2129
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,256
You don't want all the same rights

2130
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:59,584
Cuz then you'd have to do all the same

2131
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,424
You don't want to do you know that kind of

2132
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
If it does happen though

2133
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,336
All the sudden

2134
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:16,224
There's no other than

2135
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,016
Ignorant

2136
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,600
Hatred or whatever

2137
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,392
Ignorant

2138
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
Condescension

2139
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,000
Like what else would you describe it as

2140
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,328
Sums up Alex Jones to a T

2141
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,704
Sup Jordan this next clip we get back to a very familiar theme

2142
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,496
In 2015 Alex Jones

2143
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
You got it

2144
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Directions to take out the Taliban

2145
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,640
8 years in

2146
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
Helicopters

2147
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,488
Pharmacist

2148
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,680
And the Russians want to take them out

2149
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,752
Even meet with them

2150
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:15,616
They won't because it's there

2151
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
Incredible

2152
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,736
Arby's

2153
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,320
The globalist Army is

2154
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:28,928
Isn't done

2155
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
Doesn't he work a desk

2156
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,280
Skip for the National Guard

2157
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:34,816
What are you talkin about

2158
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,888
I don't know

2159
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:52,736
Come to non-existent photo op. Land somewhere

2160
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Trip they took

2161
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,296
Look I mean

2162
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:59,648
Historical and present

2163
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,208
He's just doing things

2164
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,232
Conflate

2165
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,512
The idea that

2166
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,584
Proxy Army of angry Muslims

2167
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,400
Is it in Russia is

2168
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:12,704
Really the only people good on the other side

2169
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,776
Problematic

2170
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,312
Deeply

2171
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:29,344
I am bringing up whenever he talks about Trump

2172
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,368
Bringing up most

2173
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,648
So the times you talked about Russia

2174
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:37,792
Nutty's never says anything negative about Russia even if you even if you are

2175
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,584
Flattered by Russia

2176
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,704
Dugan hadn't said any of the stuff

2177
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,496
He says about him later like these

2178
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,056
The perfect model of an American inside

2179
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,360
Late 26th

2180
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,408
So at this point

2181
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,688
But he hadn't been

2182
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,712
He just

2183
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,016
Sees himself in Russian State media

2184
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:01,344
He just sees familiarity and narrative

2185
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,880
He doesn't realize that it's

2186
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,672
Because he's absorbing their narrative

2187
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,952
To some extent

2188
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,232
And because

2189
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,512
Their narrative

2190
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,304
Are harshly conservative

2191
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
Depressing

2192
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
That matter

2193
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:18,752
Yeah you're right he's all about freedom but philosophy

2194
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Ratably

2195
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,056
Credibly

2196
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,616
Yeah he's he's very against freedom

2197
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,896
8 likes

2198
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
He likes

2199
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,456
Think about it

2200
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:32,064
Prefer that nobody but him had Italy loves to fake cry but where you really belong

2201
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,088
Is being a mouth

2202
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,368
Seven oppressive regime

2203
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
Yeah I mean

2204
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
I started to wrestle with this

2205
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,720
As we've gone along

2206
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,000
Like

2207
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,536
We started this with

2208
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,072
Why did Alex Jones

2209
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:43,840
Become

2210
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,376
Trump's propaganda

2211
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,704
And I started to realize now month

2212
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Listen to this

2213
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,752
I mean of course

2214
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:55,360
What else would Alex have done

2215
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,920
Because I hadn't listened to nearly as much

2216
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,992
Alex Jones as I have now

2217
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,344
It's real crazy that this conspiracy theorist decided to jump on this train

2218
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,904
But the more I think about it the more

2219
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,696
We all should have seen that coming

2220
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,512
A mile away

2221
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,304
Yeah course will ya

2222
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,352
We everybody has written him off as a

2223
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,888
Conspiracy theorist

2224
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,240
Hard right

2225
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:28,640
Oppression views nobody really harsh coated bigotry

2226
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
Love of guns

2227
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,832
Those being combined and I really don't like that those are almost always

2228
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,856
Combine

2229
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,208
Alex Jones

2230
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,744
Is it

2231
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,096
I've already seen you have a great day

2232
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:55,776
Does Nick clip actually dovetails into the Trump investigation

2233
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:03,456
Up to this point this is the first time he comes up now almost 2 hours until episodes

2234
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,576
Of the

2235
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,344
Okay

2236
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,880
Apparently

2237
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
Some lady

2238
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,928
Ask him a question

2239
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,952
Open with her hands on her

2240
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:17,536
And ask a question about like

2241
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,072
How bad he is about women

2242
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,632
Yeah and

2243
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:25,984
Remember that and it weaves into a story about him

2244
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
Himself

2245
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,824
And a very f*****-up

2246
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,104
Retelling of History

2247
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,384
That is not true

2248
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,200
Wow

2249
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,808
Jeb Bush caught with a pro

2250
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,600
With her hands on her hips

2251
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:47,744
Just grandstanding to manipulate women

2252
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:52,096
Jamaica

2253
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:03,104
Anyone needs

2254
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,640
Demetrius

2255
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,688
Psychologist or otherwise to know how to put your hands on me

2256
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,224
Secondly

2257
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,528
How to look at somebody with

2258
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,392
Within the context

2259
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:17,440
Alex Jones

2260
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:20,256
Gun-free

2261
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,816
Run by Bloomberg

2262
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,632
And stuff like that he's making this up

2263
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,936
About this woman who asked a question

2264
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,472
He's making that up

2265
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
And sayings

2266
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:32,032
This is all brainwashing

2267
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,312
That's all he does

2268
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,872
Every single time something like this happen

2269
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,408
He just comes up with it

2270
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:40,480
A concoction of all

2271
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,832
I'm a big fan of other people

2272
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,600
Grandstand

2273
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:48,672
That's one where you live

2274
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:54,048
F****** dial that leave that one alone she wasn't fake crying

2275
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:59,680
But also like he's making stuff up all the time it is obviously another made

2276
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
And what have you

2277
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,128
So like later roll sec

2278
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:09,152
Literal

2279
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,176
Literal cycle

2280
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
He also is imagining

2281
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:13,760
That like

2282
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,808
This hate this be projecting this

2283
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:19,392
Everyone's trying to brainwash you in the same way

2284
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,952
Someone critiquing him is a literal gobble

2285
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:25,024
Really f***** up anyway

2286
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,960
This is how they stay stuff

2287
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,032
This is how dumb they think we are

2288
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,920
Yelp

2289
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:46,272
This is how they pull these

2290
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,576
Michelle Malkin

2291
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:54,976
She said that I was a liar years ago

2292
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,352
And said it was a robot dog that flew off a cliff

2293
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:06,240
No reason

2294
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
I have no idea

2295
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,616
I have no idea what it is that point

2296
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,904
And then she had

2297
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,928
Guys weather

2298
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,768
Yelling kill Michelle Malkin lean down behind me

2299
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:31,584
Web camera

2300
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,888
National hubs that day

2301
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:37,984
Hard copy extra NBC News CBS News

2302
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:41,824
To say

2303
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,616
Fine

2304
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,640
Like

2305
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,944
If Michelle Malkin

2306
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:49,504
Did Thrift Shop against you

2307
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,040
Whatever

2308
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,088
I apologize apologize

2309
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,368
Sorry you had to go through that

2310
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,672
I don't support Michelle Malkin either

2311
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:59,744
That's f***** up that's the right

2312
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,536
Sucks sucks

2313
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:02,816
Doesn't realize

2314
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,352
Don't relate at all

2315
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,656
What's going on

2316
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:08,192
She called me a liar

2317
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:17,664
I don't know what that story is about throwing dog off a cliff

2318
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,456
I can only f******

2319
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,992
Look into it so many

2320
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:24,064
You know I only have enough energy

2321
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,880
This is like Castro is like

2322
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:29,184
Whatever I don't care

2323
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,464
You are a liar

2324
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:32,256
Damn baby weren't lying about this

2325
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:33,792
Who cares

2326
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,560
Exactly

2327
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,608
Let's get to what he's super wrong about

2328
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,008
I got calls from National talk show host Alex Me Maybe over for you

2329
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,200
But this is a type of stuff they can pull

2330
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:58,624
He was going to end up basically beating Hillary beating Obama

2331
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:04,000
And so they ran that hoax

2332
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,792
Where they go

2333
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:07,072
Isolated

2334
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,888
Microphone that was a corduroy

2335
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,704
Cordless microphone

2336
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,008
Cardioid

2337
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,104
What singer Rock Band Whatever

2338
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:28,576
The Scream

2339
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,696
Experience

2340
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:36,512
So his argument is that

2341
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:39,584
Much like the hour starting on them

2342
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,144
Just like

2343
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:47,776
Took down Howard Dean scream

2344
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,664
Name is used to famous to popular

2345
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,736
He was going to destroy Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton

2346
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,016
I'm starting to think

2347
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
If I

2348
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,576
I'm remembering back

2349
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:08,000
Howard Dean

2350
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:10,048
And I'm picturing him

2351
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:10,816
Standing

2352
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
To Obama and Hillary

2353
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,400
And then I'm remembering that

2354
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:16,192
He was not running against either of the

2355
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:20,800
2004-2008 against

2356
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:25,152
It was just before the Iowa caucuses in 2004

2357
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:28,992
I'll give you a

2358
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:35,392
Surprise

2359
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:41,280
Yeah I know

2360
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,048
With

2361
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,072
Like it was not

2362
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,864
Set up by Obama

2363
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,680
But let's go down the list

2364
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:50,752
Of all of the people

2365
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,800
Just for fun cuz I have the list

2366
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
John Kerry

2367
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,128
Howard Dean

2368
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:58,432
Dick Gephardt Hillary

2369
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,784
That's it Hillary

2370
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:06,880
Wesley Clark is the closest Alex Jones Mike state to a global

2371
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,768
Is a general

2372
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:19,424
Why would you eat pepper haircut why would what a weird world

2373
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:21,472
Minute but it did not last very long

2374
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,520
He came out with that

2375
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,664
There was plans to take over 7 countries

2376
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,992
Howard Dean

2377
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,832
And it's another one of those situations

2378
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:42,208
That's the worst possible guy

2379
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,048
A terrible friend

2380
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:50,400
2004 my brother drove around a rehab the beetle

2381
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,424
That he had

2382
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:57,824
He'd fixed up himself

2383
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:02,432
Sicario 4 because even mediocrity than approved

2384
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:05,760
Yeah

2385
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:11,392
Especially

2386
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:15,744
I think I sincerely think the John Kerry could have been

2387
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,024
President

2388
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,584
Real decent chance of winning

2389
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:22,656
Had it not been for the Swift boats

2390
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:25,472
Yeah I which is Jerome corsi

2391
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:33,408
Congratulations for destroying 50 years of our country

2392
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:39,808
At least 50 years who knows how long it's been extended the f*** announcers

2393
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,856
G dubs

2394
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:42,880
Initially

2395
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:48,768
Probably not having you knows it's tough to rewrite history

2396
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,560
That's true

2397
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:58,752
It's hard to imagine that a Democratic president would get away with the biggest lies

2398
02:04:59,008 --> 02:04:59,520
That you can

2399
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
Did you can

2400
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,568
Possibly give

2401
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
Which was the

2402
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:06,688
War in Iraq

2403
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:11,552
You're right the right is much better at

2404
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,600
I mean they're wrong

2405
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,392
Because there cuz we all know there.

2406
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:18,720
Well the thing is I think the right is always wrong

2407
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,792
At being a safeguard

2408
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:22,816
You know like

2409
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:26,400
Democrats when they're in power can never really do too much

2410
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:28,448
Because the right is so angry

2411
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,496
And so aggressive that they pushed back

2412
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,264
On everything

2413
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,152
So hard

2414
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:42,784
Conservative

2415
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,320
Republican

2416
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,112
We get called the alt left

2417
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:51,488
Write creeping socialism

2418
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,768
Play creeping Sharia

2419
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,656
Totally

2420
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:03,008
I was jumped episode

2421
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:06,080
With noted chiropractor dr. green

2422
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,872
Yes you come visit

2423
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,688
You comes into talk about how

2424
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:15,040
Superman

2425
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:19,904
There was a shortage of gas prices prices

2426
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,672
Totally

2427
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,952
Stagflation

2428
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:24,768
With super male vitality

2429
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,496
Keeps doing this like

2430
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:38,080
I want to cover the waterfront

2431
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,872
Uses that expression a lot by the way

2432
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:45,760
Ben Lovett I think we need to use a lot more Waterfront

2433
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,576
Of course

2434
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,368
A really long tail

2435
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,184
Yeah but we get this

2436
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:01,376
What do you make of rice

2437
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:05,472
Why are you asking

2438
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:07,520
Russia's tried to come to the u.s. tab

2439
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:13,152
Capacity of the chiropractor

2440
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:19,296
The Japanese stop scene

2441
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:22,880
2 days before Pearl Harbor

2442
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,632
We're going on

2443
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:36,192
Diplomatic

2444
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:38,240
Rice has been kicked out of

2445
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:45,408
I don't think they realize.

2446
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,432
But you just

2447
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:47,456
Mention depressive

2448
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:53,856
It's on president

2449

But be that as it may look you're right why the f*** you asking dr. group

2452
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:16,128
I meant Alex Jones ends up saying

I'm glad he was wrong turn it off by the time

2454
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,624
I think even his dumbass fans get like

2455
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,648
By this weekend be boring

2456
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,184

02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,552
Zoom in

2466
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:57,856
Yeah

2467
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,416
The end of October 14th

2468
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:02,976
This

2469
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,256
Is I think

2470
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,024
One of the most

2471
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,792
Important days

2472
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,072
In our investigation

2473
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,376
This day is

2474
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,400
Credible

2475
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:11,936
I think

2476
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,472
Notebook

2477
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:16,032
I think this is the day that I was Jones's brain

2478
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:17,824
I think

2479
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:18,848
If you lost it

2480
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,128
On October

2481
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,920
15 to 27

2482
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,968
I might be wrong

2483
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,504
I've made a lot of bad prediction

2484
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,040
I cop to that

2485
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,064
A butt

2486
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,600
The show start

2487
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
This is going to frustrate

2488
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
S*** out of you

2489
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,720
And I love it

2490
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,768
It's going to frustrate the s*** out of our audience

2491
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,840
Alex Jones does one

2492
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:42,400
Witchy professionally teases

2493
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:43,680
Why

2494
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,984
He doesn't say

2495
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,008
At all

2496
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,544
In this next clip

2497
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,824
Why is

2498
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:51,616
I'm freaking out

2499
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:56,224
It's so good it's saying nothing for a long time

2500
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,016
It's it's amazing

2501
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:00,320
Watch this professional at f****** work

2502
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,368
Every too much

2503
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:08,256
Stories come together

2504
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:11,840
Knowledge

2505
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:13,376
And understanding

2506
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:17,984
I've got terminal systems worldwide

2507
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,288
Which is to say nothing at all

2508
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:25,408
The Tumblers basically click into place the safe door opens

2509
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,456
So I want

2510
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
Keep in mind

2511
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:29,760
This clip is

2512
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,552
3 1/2 minutes long

2513
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,368
He says nothing

2514
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:37,184
If you at any point while you're listening to this

2515
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,232
Think you know what he's about to say

2516
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,256
You're probably wrong

2517
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:43,328
Unless you're

2518
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,728
Whenever we talk about amazing broadcast

2519
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,264
This is my only

2520
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,872
The end of this about how he's not saying anything

2521
02:10:56,384 --> 02:11:02,528
It's for 24 seconds in he said nothing

2522
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:08,416
Dory comes out

2523
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:11,744
Brilliant

2524
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:14,048
But especially America that schizophrenia

2525
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,632
Yeah

2526
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,960
You can really see what's inside

2527
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:26,848
And a group of Stories the last 2 weeks

2528
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:29,152
Come together in a confluence

2529
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:30,944
Which ones

2530
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,528
That is so important

2531
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,952
I am having trouble

2532
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:45,280
Feeling even Worthy

2533
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,096
To try to describe to you

2534
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:53,984
Absolutely country

2535
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,056
And it takes me to my

2536
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:00,384
Poor

2537
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,408
This guy's a f******

2538
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,432
Impro

2539
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
Got a lot of long pauses here

2540
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,064
In fact so important

2541
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,136
This morning before the show

2542
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,720
And it connected and everything else we already know

2543
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
About what

2544
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:23,936
Almost went

2545
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:28,288

With myself

2549
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:43,648
An article

2550
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,696
Put on emergency alert

2551
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:57,984
Ancient Armory stories

2552
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:18,976
I would think coming outside to Telluride

2553
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:35,872
Door locked

2554
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,456
There's a f****** Pro

2555
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:44,576
Really situation wherein and really see

2556
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,856
Worst

2557
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,672
Case scenario analyses

2558
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:51,488
We've come up with many others about come up with

2559
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,512
Concurrent

2560
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,048
Shipley

2561
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,888
Is so

2562
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,424
Horrible

2563
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:04,032
And it confirms our worst

2564
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,616
Not fears are worst

2565
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:12,992
Long-term projections

2566
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,016
All of them

2567
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,880
Your projections about what

2568
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,208
I am not

2569
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:25,024
Did you eat

2570
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:30,912
Which instrument

2571
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:35,008
F*** off

2572
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:40,128
I'm not trying to be dramatic

2573
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:42,944
That's amazing man was nothing

2574
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,992
That's a gifted broadcaster

2575
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,528
Boat like that

2576
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:48,832
Tubi

2577
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:51,136
About nothing he said nothing

2578
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:51,904
He said nothing

2579
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:55,488
Another like 3 minutes after that

2580
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:59,840
He does touch on specific topics after that

2581
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,960
The story of it is got him

2582
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,240
All Shook Up

2583
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,592
Jesus

2584
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:11,872
So does he

2585
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:24,160
So did he get in front of it

2586
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,976
He was on the air the entire time

2587
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:35,424
Yeah but did he

2588
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,192
Ghostwriting

2589
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,056
That is like

2590
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:46,176
Really getting him out of sorts

2591
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,968
Would you like to try and guess

2592
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,760
The worst long-term

2593
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:52,064
October 15th

2594
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
2015

2595
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,368
Correct

2596
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,464
Fast & Furious 6

2597
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,000
Came out

2598
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,328
The timeline I'm not sure

2599
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:06,400
They

2600
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,680
The basketball season

2601
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
Golden State Warriors

2602
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:16,128
They have no idea what they're coming for him

2603
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:19,456
But they're going to go on at are they're going to win 73 games

2604
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:24,832
I know I'd like for you to try

2605
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:27,392
Was that that was that the year before that

2606
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:29,952
Remember I'd like for a serious gas bill

2607
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:31,488
Geopolitical

2608
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,328
Possibly be shaking him to his core like that

2609
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,608
5:30 amp

2610
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:38,400
And put his head in his hands

2611
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,448
And pretend that he can't do the show

2612
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:44,800
And he's going to get David night to host so we can get Paul Joseph Watson to write an article about it

2613
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:49,152
Cuz this is going to go viral and if I just talked about it on the air

2614
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,504
It turns out

2615
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:54,528
That

2616
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,320
All of the iodine

2617
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,088
Is gone

2618
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:59,904
No you be way more f***** up

2619
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:03,488
That's true

2620
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:05,792
And we have megalomaniac

2621
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:09,376
Running the show that hate us the better cleaners

2622
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:11,680
Just because we don't commit crime

2623
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,472
Is measurable

2624
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:15,520
They had it usually produce so much wealth

2625
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,288
Not true

2626
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:19,360
Just because we're strong they hate us because we're good

2627
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:22,944
Not true

2628
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:23,968
Not true

2629
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,784
I told you that

2630
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,880
They were going to start

2631
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:33,696
They haven't

2632
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:40,352
They're calling it payments for endorsements

2633
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:48,544
Campaign for Liberty other organizations

2634
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:59,808
Taking over the Republican Party

2635
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:02,368
Nautica

2636
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,392
Not really

2637
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,536
Paul Ryan

2638
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:11,328
Congratulations

2639
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:18,496
This is a peaceful Revolution

2640
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:22,080
Nah

2641
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:25,152
They are trying to find anything to indict

2642
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:28,992
Ron Paul

2643
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,808
RuPaul

2644
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,608
That is coming

2645
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:45,376
Clarence Thomas

2646
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:56,640
So it's because two of Rand Paul staffers were indicted on

2647
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,968
Don't know what the truth of that store you

2648
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:00,992
So

2649
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:01,760
The charges

2650
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,808
From the Elder Paul

2651
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:05,856
2012 presidential campaign

2652
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:08,672
In which former state senator Kent Sorenson

2653
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:11,488
Admitted to receiving $70

2654
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:17,888
From Ron Paul presidential campaign for switching his endorsement from

2655
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:19,680
Ron Paul

2656
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:23,264
Federal prosecutors allege that the three individuals who were charged

2657
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,032
Indicted

2658
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:24,800
Not to us

2659
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:29,664
Federal Election Commission

2660
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,688
The cover-up payment

2661
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:31,456
Sorensen

2662
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:33,760
Exchange for his endorsement to Ron Paul

2663
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:38,624
Benton service Paul's campaign chairman in 2012 but has maintained his innocence

2664
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:42,464
We went on to work for America's Liberty political action committee

2665
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,256
Super PAC

2666
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:48,096
But took the organization when the first round of indictments were handed down

2667
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,728
So okay to switch is indoors

2668
02:19:57,312 --> 02:20:01,920
It's really cheap you should you should hold if you're going to do that illegal

2669
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,456
773

2670
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,224
Senator

2671
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,272
It's not even a senator

2672
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:09,344
.88 might be an influential person in

2673
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,136
Various circles

2674
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:12,928
You can't get more than that

2675
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,696
Perspective

2676
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:14,976
Senator

2677
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:20,096
Yes they committed

2678
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,656
For committing crime

2679
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,704
Is it going to rain

2680
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
For committing crime

2681
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:33,664
Anybody for committing crimes told him he thinks that it's going to be

2682
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:40,064
Perfectly timed destroys campaign

2683
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:42,368
It's just that

2684
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:44,672
That's how the court works

2685
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,464
That is one of those things

2686
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,512
Though we're

2687
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,816
There is always a part of my

2688
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:52,352
Conspiracy theory brand that's like

2689
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:55,424
That has to happen

2690
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:57,472
That kind of

2691
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:03,360
That kind of bribery always get caught we live in Illinois

2692
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
That

2693
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,664
I'm sure

2694
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:10,784
The courts

2695
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,064
Can't deal with

2696
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:14,112
Things they don't know about

2697
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:19,232
If if you don't have a charge

2698
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:20,768
Accord can't hear the charge

2699
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,304
And in this case

2700
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,096
Do you guys got sloppy

2701
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:24,864
And

2702
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:26,144
Clearly Sorensen

2703
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,448
The receiving the money

2704
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:31,264
Look

2705
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:37,408
He was paid off to admit that he received 3000

2706
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,944
And $1

2707
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:41,760
In order to admit

2708
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,296
$73,000

2709
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,416
You take down rampaul dates

2710
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:53,280
Attorney General

2711
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:54,048
Who's been indicted

2712
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:56,096
So that's that's the big news

2713
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:00,960
General news is the worst projections

2714
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:05,056
Infowars is Rand Paul staffers got taken down for

2715
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:05,824
Committing crimes

2716
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:06,592
Sprite

2717
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:07,360
That's

2718
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:11,712
Confirms the worst for 3 minutes

2719
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:18,880
Processor and write down how they

2720
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,928
And now they're in

2721
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:25,536
Trouble for it but the thing is it's not just about them it's also about the Texas Attorney General

2722
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,584
She never says my name

2723
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,864
Because I don't think he knows

2724
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:31,936
His name is Ken Paxton

2725
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:37,568
I apologize is like four paragraphs or so so

2726
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:38,592
I'm going to get through it

2727
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:40,384
Text Mom

2728
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:43,712
This is an article about why I got in trouble

2729
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:51,392
The case and the federal one involved Mr Paxton's work in a 2011 promoting and recruiting of investor

2730
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,928
Technology company

2731
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:55,488
Serve Energy Incorporated

2732
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,048
Federal officials accused Mr PacSun.

2733
02:22:58,304 --> 02:23:00,864
Encouraging and pressuring investors to invest

2734
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:05,216
Conserve energy while failing to disclose that he was being compensated by the company

2735
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:07,776
The investors included several of mr. Paxton

2736
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,568
Since friends and fellow lawmakers

2737
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:13,152
Court documents filed by the SEC claim that Mr packs

2738
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:16,736
Austin raised $840,000 from investors

2739
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:18,016
And received 100,000

2740
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,040
Shares of stock

2741
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:19,808
In return

2742
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:21,600
But never disclosed his Commission

2743
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:25,440
Mr. Paxton told investigators that he accepted the shares as a gift

2744
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,720
From the company's founder

2745
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,536
But actually if they okay

2746
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
Mission failed

2747
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:37,472
So it becomes they will they won't they he said she said just like me

2748
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:40,288
I like this company and

2749
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,080
But

2750
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:42,848
Unfortunately

2751
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,176
The unfortunately the article

2752
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:46,944
Goes on

2753
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:52,064
We should note the Paxton was fine by the Texas state Securities 2014 for failing to

2754
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:56,416
Disclosed.

2755
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:02,048
Describe that as a quote administrative oversight

2756
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:05,888
So he's admitted

2757
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:07,424
Similar behavior in the past

2758
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:09,216
SEC also claims

2759
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:11,008
After meeting with survey

2760
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:13,312
Paxton was offered a 10% Commission

2761
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,080
And from the company

2762
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:16,640
And when

2763
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:19,200
Paxton wrote back quote I will get to work

2764
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:22,528
Scheduling meetings with a number of investors shortly thereafter

2765
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:26,624
This issue is identified

2766
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,416
4 quotes

2767
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,184
Services

2768
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:30,208
According to the filing

2769
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,768
This is the bulk of the case against Paxton

2770
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,560
But it's not the entirety of it

2771
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:39,168
The charge also implicates Paxton in the fraud charges against the former surf energy

2772
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:41,472
Dceo name is Matt

2773
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:45,056
Who faces the most dramatic charges of life

2774
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:48,128
Amazon

2775
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:50,176
Freescale

2776
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:53,504
Some of these investors were people who were recruited by Pat

2777
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:56,320
And phrases like quote

2778
02:24:56,576 --> 02:25:00,672
Thing to determine whether Maps claims were true up here several times throughout the filing

2779
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:02,976
Maps

2780
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:04,768
From claims that serve energy product

2781
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:05,792
Computer servers

2782
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:07,072
We're essentially

2783
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:09,376
Specially energy-efficient

2784
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,144
And cutting-edge

2785
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,680
Which does not appear to have been

2786
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,496
Paxton is associated with

2787
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,520
Two in the filing

2788
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:20,128
And did not know whether

2789
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:22,176
I need serve energies claims were true

2790
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:22,944
He conduct

2791
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:27,040
Didn't know due diligence to confirm clarify or correct serve energy

2792
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,600
So that's why I said

2793
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,952
Attorney general is in trouble

2794
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,376
Bill committed

2795
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:50,336
He filled out a paperwork

2796
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:53,664
And was getting paid under the table for bullying people

2797
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,944
Bullying is strong

2798
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,248
Really actively recruiting

2799
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,528
Crime

2800
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,136
Does this happen is so

2801
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:05,952
Does this happen on the left

2802
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:06,720
Maybe

2803
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:08,768
Like juice

2804
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:13,376
If we who have

2805
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:18,752
Like like with this type of situation with all of these f****** situation situation

2806
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:19,776
Clarks

2807
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:20,800
Situation all of that stuff

2808
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:22,080
It's always

2809
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:24,640
Crime

2810
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,920
They didn't commit the crime

2811
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,344
So yeah

2812
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:36,672
He was a democratic

2813
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:41,024
Why is it not okay for for us

2814
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,816
We cast aside are weirdos

2815
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:53,312
Now maybe Alex Jones exaggerate a lot of the claims again

2816
02:26:57,664 --> 02:27:03,808
Martha Stewart went to jail for inside

2817
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:07,648
Great but you committed a crime

2818
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:10,464
I think that a lot of liberals

2819
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:15,328
Have a very large even-keel about abandoning their own

2820
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,120
When it's clear they've committed crime

2821
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:22,240
You know what I related to I related to what happened with smoking

2822
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,264
As a whole

2823
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,288
Like smoking

2824
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:27,104
Distasteful

2825
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:31,200
Used to be okay to smoke on planes

2826
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:34,016
I used to be okay to smoke

2827
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:38,624
You can smoke in the hospital smoke

2828
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:42,720
Whataburger

2829
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:44,512
It became a thing where

2830
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:45,792
Science

2831
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:47,072
Came out really hate

2832
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:47,840
You shouldn't be doing

2833
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:49,632
It's probably really bad

2834
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,448
Got it got it

2835
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:53,728
Cool cool

2836
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:54,496
Sorry about that

2837
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:56,032
Sorry about that we'll just go over here

2838
02:27:56,288 --> 02:28:00,128
Call man last night I met a secondhand smoke

2839
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,920
Jesus

2840
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:12,160
As a science was wrong you should still be able to smoke 008

2841
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:18,560
Percent of far-off from the truth I think secondhand smoke is a little bit exaggerated

2842
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:24,704
It's even as a smoker I get its

2843
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:30,848
Way better smokers are a facsimile for liberals in the

2844
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:33,152
Event like we

2845
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,176
Smoke everywhere

2846
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:35,712
We were smoking

2847
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:36,736
Apartment right now

2848
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:41,600
We realize like oh

2849
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:42,368
Contain

2850
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:43,904
Smoke can't get anywhere

2851
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,184
In the sky

2852
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,976
That's f***** up alright fine

2853
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:50,048
We agree to change our Behavior accordingly

2854
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:51,840
I&M go along with it

2855
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,376
Whereas conservative

2856
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,656
They're not

2857
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:59,776
Like smokers

2858
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:01,568
Eventually I won't be able to smoke

2859
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:05,152
And that's why I

2860
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:06,176
People on the right

2861
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:12,832
When all the time differently defend people were clearly

2862
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,392
And Alex

2863
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:16,928
Like

2864
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:18,208
It goes back to the

2865
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:21,792
Confederate flag on trucks thing we were talking about earlier

2866
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:25,376
If any articles other than headline

2867
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,656
Keep know this stuff

2868
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,472
You know that there's like

2869
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:32,544
Miss Sorenson admitted to taking the payoff

2870
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:34,080
To change his

2871
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:36,128
That's not being

2872
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:40,224
No that's a payoff yeah that's okay

2873
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,760
I suppose the closest

2874
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:46,624
Analog is probably how people treated Cosby

2875
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:49,952
Okay

2876
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:52,000
Sure

2877
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:55,840
20 women came out okay sure

2878
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:57,888
Okay at a certain point

2879
02:29:58,144 --> 02:30:00,704
You know even the most well though there still people

2880
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,752
Got2b didn't do it

2881
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,776
Cosby

2882
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:08,384
Sure are the same way with Louis c.k. likes Louis c.k. definitely is a

2883
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:13,760
Should be committed sexual assault many many times

2884
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:19,136
I think this is different though

2885
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:21,952
Because with Cosby and with Louis c.k.

2886
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,232
There are

2887
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,256
Long

2888
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:28,608
With long histories of really positive experiences

2889
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:29,632
You had because of

2890
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,168
Like I

2891
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:31,936
Love

2892
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:32,704
Louis c.k.

2893
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,728
Hey back in like

2894
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:34,752
The early 90s

2895
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:37,824
Late 90s early 2000

2896
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,360
He was amazing

2897
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:42,432
Betty was even before

2898
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:43,712
Shifted

2899
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:46,272
And became the Louis c.k. that everyone knows

2900
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:52,416
Like the I like those f****** joke for awesome

2901
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
Again

2902
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:57,280
Is running out of extras in your life

2903
02:30:57,536 --> 02:31:02,400
Are those things that are very difficult

2904
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:03,936
2

2905
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,752
You feel like you have to give up on them

2906
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:08,032
Because you see the person has

2907
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:11,616
They grew they actually are different then

2908
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:14,432
Just automatically Defending Your Own blind

2909
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,992
I understand the struggle of like

2910
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:20,832
Man this guy's art doesn't match up with who he is actually is a

2911
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:21,856
Person that's f*****

2912
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:23,392
Right

2913
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:24,416
That's disappointing

2914
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:26,208
This is Alex's being like

2915
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:28,512
If it take any of our team to take masol

2916
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:33,120
That's more cowardly

2917
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:35,680
Any and every possible reason

2918
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:36,960
How do you

2919
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:43,104
Everything Joe Arpaio dead

2920
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:46,432
Everything

2921
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:50,272
That just makes it more likely that more of these guys are going to be there

2922
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:54,624
If you f****** pardon Joe Arpaio

2923
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:56,672
Does Debbie Moore

2924
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:58,976
Yeah

2925
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:03,072
The flip side of it too is like there is a power dynamic

2926
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,352
To it also

2927
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:06,656
S*** is like

2928
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:07,936
Ted Cruz's

2929
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,728
Got indicted

2930
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,752
Something like that

2931
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:14,592
Even though at this point in 2015 he supports Ted Cruz

2932
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:17,152
Yeah I don't think so I think it's because it's wrong

2933
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:18,688
Legacy support

2934
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:19,712
Ted Cruz

2935
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:20,992
Mostly

2936
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,784
But he loves Grandpa

2937
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,344
Image

2938
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,648
Pure libertarian

2939
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,208
Right

2940
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:31,488
The hits.

2941
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:32,768
Stupid

2942
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:36,352
His fear is that they're coming after these

2943
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:37,120
Tea Party

2944
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:38,400
Libertarian type

2945
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:39,680
And because it's a

2946
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,984
Storm of crime

2947
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:44,032
We're going to invite them

2948
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:47,360
He has to have to support

2949
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,408
In the same way is it like

2950
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:50,688
Individually

2951
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:52,224
Even the whites

2952
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:53,760
Supremacist don't care

2953
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:55,808
One of theirs get the red

2954
02:32:56,832 --> 02:33:01,184
Send out warrants

2955
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:02,464
Sweet yeah

2956
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,328
Great Ohio to Charlottesville

2957
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:12,704
Yeah

2958
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:18,336
Madonna me the former comic

2959
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:20,384
It's whatever

2960
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:26,784
Cancel alarm or Cantrell or whatever

2961
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,832
Metro

2962
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:32,160
You're so wrong on this terrible machine

2963
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:33,696
You're on your f****** phone

2964
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:36,768
Unless you become important to

2965
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,048
Alex Jones is

2966
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,072
Machine or whatever

2967
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:41,632
When you saw what that what you did to Jason Kessler

2968
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:46,752
The guy who organized the unite the right thing

2969
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:50,336
Right

2970
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:58,784
Oh we mentioned in passing but we covered.

2971
02:33:59,296 --> 02:34:00,576
So I mean look at you got to

2972
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:03,648
Even even we support all of our own

2973
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,184
Don't really care about the bottom

2974
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:07,232
Risport Oliver on to ascertain

2975
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:12,864
Anybody who's not you

2976
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,400
Supported you in further hoax

2977
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:19,008
Probably about 2

2978
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:20,800
Obama Iran deal

2979
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,104
Stupid

2980
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,640
We are we got some more clips

2981
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:25,664
Get through

2982
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:27,456
Plus this thing down

2983
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:29,504
Does Mexico

2984
02:34:32,832 --> 02:34:33,600
Because of

2985
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,624
Better come down

2986
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,952
He says this

2987
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:42,304
Which so many of the other things we've talked about

2988
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,888
On this episode and the last like 5 episodes are so Russia

2989
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:46,912
But

2990
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:48,192
What he saying

2991
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,216
Is like

2992
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:51,008
It's even next level

2993
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:57,920
Wash it was captured

2994
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:01,504
Play pulled away from The Entity

2995
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:06,880
Besieged by

2996
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:08,416
Economic Warfare

2997
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:09,184
And

2998
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,976
Destabilization

2999
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,256
Foundations

3000
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:17,376
Strongman Mafia corruption

3001
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,704
Is Angelic compared to the

3002
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:25,568
Russians are not putting fluoride their water in cancer viruses on their backs

3003
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:32,736
And when they bring down the Russians

3004
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,184
That's why

3005
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:50,144
Secret weapon is a radical Muslims

3006
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:57,056
Great

3007
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:58,592
Everywhere

3008
02:35:58,848 --> 02:36:02,944
Driving around with a

3009
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:13,696
Yeah but it's like what he saying there if you really want to sum up that clip entirely its Russia is the last line of defense

3010
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:14,720
Andy

3011
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:19,584
Brushes important

3012
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:22,144
Do you understand everybody gets

3013
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,936
Do you understand

3014
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:24,960
Cliff

3015
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,752
In that Club Fortune

3016
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:28,032
He's betraying

3017
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:30,336
He believed that Russia is better and

3018
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:32,384
I'm stronger than the American people

3019
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,688
Take out Russia

3020
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:36,480
Those walk right over us

3021
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:38,784
What was we are

3022
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:41,600
Public

3023
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:44,672
It's Russia

3024
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:46,208
Because we couldn't possibly stand up

3025
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,512
That's what I like

3026
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,584
Hugh loves Russia

3027
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:55,424
F*****-up can we get it

3028
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,448
Yeah I'd love it

3029
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:57,984
Can we just get him to move

3030
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,032
Especially if it was in the North

3031
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:03,872
Cinema Siberia that's what I'm saying

3032
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:10,272
Because it's not really important

3033
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:11,040
240

3034
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:17,696
Why would you love Russia

3035
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
But

3036
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,512
I like

3037
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,560
Imagine imagine

3038
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,584
Him moving

3039
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:26,912
Just for a second

3040
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,216
Of course he would never

3041
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,008
No probably not

3042
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:31,776
Ever

3043
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:33,312
No he wants to live in Austin

3044
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:38,432
Catoctin f****** great like a lot of America

3045
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:42,784
Unlike a lot of Russia

3046
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:49,440
He's a f****** idiot but if you want to think about Russia at hold on to it for a little bit

3047
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:54,816
The next president going to skip is just him faking crying

3048
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,864
He tries to cry

3049
02:37:57,632 --> 02:38:00,448
Can't you tries to do this does not

3050
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:02,240
Work

3051
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,032
AJ's bail

3052
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:10,176
But has like 3 minutes long

3053
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,712
It's not worth it

3054
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:17,600
So also on this episode

3055
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:18,624
Joe big

3056
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:21,184
Has been sent out to Hillary Clinton

3057
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:22,720
And

3058
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:26,048
The really important thing

3059
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,584
In the

3060
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,352
Projection

3061
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:29,632
And trajectory

3062
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:30,400
Of Alex Jones

3063
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:31,168
Going to

3064
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,472
He

3065
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:35,264
Is out there

3066
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:36,544
2

3067
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:39,616
Like literally the goal is to cause

3068
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:41,408
Write his hole

3069
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:42,176
Goal

3070
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:43,456
His whole objective

3071
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,736
Is to stir

3072
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,528
The stir the pot

3073
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:52,416
Yeah that's what Joe Biggs. That's why you send but it hasn't really been that way up till this point

3074
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:57,280
Because the time that he went out to a trump rally and showed off his Hillary for prison shirts

3075
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:59,840
That's not really stirring

3076
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:02,400
He's now started to go out

3077
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:04,704
I do not

3078
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,520
Rally where he's going to unveil his Hillary for prison shirt

3079
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:08,800
He's going out

3080
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:09,568
Specifically

3081
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:11,104
Troll in real life

3082
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,384
As an advertising

3083
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,152
Tool

3084
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:16,736
That this is where the story bombing begin

3085
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,016
And Alex

3086
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:20,064
Starts to see

3087
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:21,856
Incredibly effective marketing

3088
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:24,160
And that's why you start to give people

3089
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,720
Screaming Bill Clinton is a rapist on television

3090
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:29,280
And all this s*** that Alex ends up doing

3091
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:31,584
To quote unquote troll the media

3092
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:33,632
When where he's really doing is Buzz Market

3093
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:35,936
And I think that this

3094
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:36,704
Episode

3095
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,240
On October 15th

3096
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:40,544
Not only has the breakdown

3097
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,080
About Alex being like

3098
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,360
It's confirmed

3099
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:45,664
They're coming for the Patriots because

3100
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:49,248
These ramps

3101
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,528
The but also

3102
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:52,064
The first time

3103
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:55,136
Will inevitably see a spike in sales

3104
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:57,440
Because your big when trolled

3105
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:59,232
Hey liberal route

3106
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:01,024
I think that those two things

3107
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:02,048
Art like

3108
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:03,328
Foundational

3109
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:05,376
In his is shipped

3110
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:08,448
This clip is a Joe Biggs

3111
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:10,240
Out at the rally

3112
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:11,264
Presentism tattoo

3113
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,568
Far we have been able to

3114
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:16,896
Basically weasel our way into the Hillary Clinton

3115
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:24,832
Hillary t-shirt

3116
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:30,464
Theories

3117
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,336
Start screaming Hillary for prison

3118
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:58,624
Was great but

3119
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,184
We're into fiscal year 2016 now

3120
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:07,584
Now it's time to start

3121
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,352
Jbr

3122
02:41:08,608 --> 02:41:11,936
Narrative of economic collapse coming.

3123
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:12,704
Happening

3124
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:17,568
Starting to not be scared as much by the

3125
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,848
Detours Buzz Marketing

3126
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:22,176
Varices

3127
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:24,736
Joe Biggs

3128
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:28,064
And I cut out all of it

3129
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:29,600
But he's just getting off

3130
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:31,136
Like in debate

3131
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:33,952
He keeps trying to have debates with people

3132
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:37,536
It's so funny cuz Alex is back in the studio

3133
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:43,424
Is people making great point

3134
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:50,592
Do you know

3135
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:52,384
Alex

3136
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:53,664
Push push

3137
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:54,432
Brush

3138
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:58,784
Argument

3139
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:00,576
It's really bizarre

3140
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,344
It's

3141
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:06,464
Exactly why

3142
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:08,512
These people are so

3143
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,048
Frustrating

3144
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,072
And stupid

3145
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:14,656
If you want

3146
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:18,240
To do that if you're going to go start

3147
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:19,520
And start debates with

3148
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:21,568
Prep

3149
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:22,848
Libby great

3150
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:24,640
Weather

3151
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,272
Half-assed

3152
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:32,576
I know I'm going to win because

3153
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:38,976
But that's the problem

3154
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:39,744
Weather

3155
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:51,776
Conspiracy theories are just got in the high and watch YouTube the

3156
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:54,336
It's the same thing with the big

3157
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:56,896
Tuesday is the equivalent intellectually

3158
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:57,920
Politico

3159
02:42:58,432 --> 02:43:00,480
I'm someone who's gotten high and watch YouTube video

3160
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:06,624
I wants to talk to you about the you-know-what

3161
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,392
What about

3162
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:08,160
CFR

3163
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:09,696
Far

3164
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:10,464
What about them

3165
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,536
What about relation

3166
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:14,816
What about Bilderberg

3167
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,568
You're too dumb to know what you're too dumb about

3168
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:32,736
Admirably in debates

3169
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:35,808
Against him thrown off by the fact that he keeps

3170
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:38,624
Clearly having to listen to Alex and his

3171
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,696
And not really engaged with

3172
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:43,744
The flow of conversation but

3173
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,560
They're their there for a little bit and then

3174
02:43:46,816 --> 02:43:47,328
Studio

3175
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:49,376
We're outside

3176
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:51,680
With a gentleman by the name of Robert

3177
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:56,800
The Fairly regular gas

3178
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:01,152
He's also a

3179
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:05,504
I think now might be a good time to listen to

3180
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,320
He would not like to help you because you're a dumb live

3181
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:11,392
The Doomsday is coming for all of us

3182
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:12,160
I think it's

3183
02:44:13,952 --> 02:44:14,720
I'm I mean I guess

3184
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:17,024
He would probably just tell you to get guns

3185
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:18,816
Water and gold

3186
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,424
I can do the

3187
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:27,776
This guy is a huge dick

3188
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:33,408
The two spaces.

3189
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:40,576
Because the whole world

3190
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:43,904
A liar

3191
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:45,440
Budget saver

3192
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:53,120
Crazy how can you believe that

3193
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:54,400
Crazy

3194
02:44:54,656 --> 02:44:55,936
Can you actually believe that

3195
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:56,960
You can't

3196
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:57,728
Possibly

3197
02:44:57,984 --> 02:44:58,752
Really believe

3198
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:03,104
You can if you really hate the idea

3199
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,384
That doesn't make

3200
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,920
Any sense at all

3201
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:12,576
Yeah well I have no

3202
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:13,600
Idea that they're doing that

3203
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:16,672
Always lie

3204
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:21,792
30 years ago

3205
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:30,752
Possibly believe that it's not the truth

3206
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:37,408
I mean I get it if you are a Russian Citizen and all you get is russian-owned Media all day everyday

3207
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:40,480
I mean even the even f****** North Korea

3208
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:42,016
More like

3209
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:45,344
We're going to die

3210
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:51,744
Do it later I'm crying

3211
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:56,096
But if you're here

3212
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:56,864
Come on

3213
02:45:57,632 --> 02:46:00,448
Outside

3214
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:04,799
And look at this and there's no possible way you can be like

3215
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:06,335
When is a state

3216
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:09,407
It gets worse

3217
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:18,111
Shame on you just it's like The Emperor's New Clothes

3218
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:22,975
Really as being a statement what do you expect

3219
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:25,535
I think

3220
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:27,071
Okay

3221
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:40,895
Walk-around

3222
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:49,087
Bus tracker

3223
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:01,887
Protests

3224
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:03,679
Said that I believe

3225
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:04,959
They don't want to kill him

3226
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:07,775
Do want him out of power

3227
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:09,311
And then they get killed

3228
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:10,847
That's what happened

3229
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:11,871
Yeah

3230
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:17,759
You know that

3231
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:24,159
All around the world has

3232
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:25,439
Kill at this point like

3233
02:47:25,951 --> 02:47:29,023
70 or 80 some Bloomers category

3234
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:35,423
Plenty of people want to kill

3235
02:47:35,679 --> 02:47:41,823
He's way better than way better at the evolved version of the kgb's

3236
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:43,103
He's operate

3237
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,639
This is pathetic

3238
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:46,943
It's naked

3239
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:50,271
In terms of how clear it is but this is a show

3240
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:51,807
That is demonstrating

3241
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,087
Outright

3242
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:55,903
Unequivocal support for Putin and Russia

3243
02:47:56,671 --> 02:47:57,951
And

3244
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:59,487
Yes and

3245
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:01,791
He has not endorsed Trump

3246
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,863
Heat this predates

3247
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:05,631
All of that

3248
02:48:06,911 --> 02:48:07,679
This is

3249
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:08,703
Where his heart is

3250
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:10,495
That Putin

3251
02:48:11,007 --> 02:48:11,775
Is awesome

3252
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:14,335
And Russia is the last line of defense

3253
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:15,871
That's f*****

3254
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:18,687
Profound

3255
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:22,271
And way worse than anything I thought that we would uncover

3256
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:28,671
Just by listening to his show it's not like we're doing any sleuthing we're just using his word

3257
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:35,583
He just knows that no one's paying attention or they already believe the global is narrative

3258
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:40,703
Right

3259
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:43,007
They're waiting for him to take a shirt off

3260
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:45,823
Or maybe because he waiting for food

3261
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:51,199
Demonize has the mainstream media so much

3262
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:52,223

3277
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:26,271
Wants to get a little sassy

02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:57,823
The Hillary Clinton speech

3324
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:01,151
But he takes the opportunity to break out some impression

3325
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:15,999

3336
02:53:12,575 --> 02:53:16,927
First impressions

3337
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:19,231
Based on what he saying

3338
02:53:19,487 --> 02:53:21,791
I think she can pull off different impression

3339
02:53:22,303 --> 02:53:23,583
She's not monotone

3340
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:24,607
Second

3341
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:25,887

Third

3343
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:28,447
Those impressions are racist

3344
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:29,471
Yeah

3345
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:30,495
Also

3346
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:34,079
If you're doing a racist impression of a Hispanic person

3347
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,103
He went

Sojourn

3356
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:05,823

Yeah doesn't do

3359
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:12,223
It's becoming really tired for us to argue

3360
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:15,039
I know right yeah

3361
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:18,623
Whatever it is they say you're doing

3362
02:54:19,135 --> 02:54:22,207
Or what you're doing

3363
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:23,743
But what they're saying

3364
02:54:23,999 --> 02:54:26,047
There is actually what we're doing

3365
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:28,607
But what is what

3366
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:29,887

3368
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:38,335
Where we're going to end

3369
02:54:38,591 --> 02:54:39,359
October 15th

3370
02:54:41,663 --> 02:54:42,687

I keep forgetting

3373
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:47,295
Support Donald Trump

3374
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:50,623
I feel like all of our investigation has actually been

3375
02:54:57,791 --> 02:55:02,143
The investigation is turned into

3376
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:04,703
History a lot

3377
02:55:04,959 --> 02:55:08,031
There's a tie

3378
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:10,335
The different stuff happening at that it

3379
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:11,871
Didn't happen so you're like

3380
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:16,735
Yeah but what I predicted

3381
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:18,527
You're not working

3382
02:55:18,783 --> 02:55:19,551
You're not awake

3383
02:55:20,063 --> 02:55:24,927
In here Alex Jones has a conversation with Joe big

3384
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:27,231
About where we stand on the candidates

3385
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:30,559
And let's see if any

3386
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:33,631
Here we go

3387
02:55:33,887 --> 02:55:40,031
This is a whole country in pool

3388
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:52,831
Sexist racist

3389
02:55:57,951 --> 02:56:00,511
I don't know my trust is history but now they're moving

3390
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:09,471
For nothing I literally

3391
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:12,799
Champion

3392
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:19,199
These are people who died

3393
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:30,207
He doesn't offer a lot of loose early in the race I'm still open

3394
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:36,607
Solutions

3395
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:55,807
We need to do something more than just building a wall

3396
02:56:56,063 --> 02:57:02,207
No I think I'll alert you won't I really doesn't fit over there I think he should have been

3397
02:57:08,863 --> 02:57:11,167
Democratic

3398
02:57:22,175 --> 02:57:28,319
As our president

3399
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:33,183
Eli's on the table

3400
02:57:35,743 --> 02:57:37,023
This is so frustrating

3401
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:40,863
For two reasons why a lot of sense

3402
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:42,911
Until then

3403
02:57:46,495 --> 02:57:48,799
Really bring home that everyone is just a Hillary

3404
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:49,823
They're not really

3405
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:51,103
They don't have any

3406
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:53,663
Foundation of like what they're for

3407
02:57:53,919 --> 02:57:54,943
As much as what they're again

3408
02:57:56,991 --> 02:57:58,527
I think it crystallized that point

3409
02:57:58,783 --> 02:58:01,599
But the idea Trump is saying a bunch of bulshit

3410
02:58:01,855 --> 02:58:03,391
It sounds good but there's no solution

3411
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:06,207
I mean that's very reasonable

3412
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:07,487
Look at Trump

3413
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:09,791
And Joe Biggs is way smarter than Alex

3414
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:11,839
At the same time

3415
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:13,119
The show is about alley

3416
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:15,167
And it is

3417
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:19,775
Peekablue frustrating

3418
02:58:20,031 --> 02:58:20,543
At all

3419
02:58:21,055 --> 02:58:21,823
In terms of trump

3420
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:24,895
It's still I like what you say

3421
02:58:27,199 --> 02:58:27,967
The fast-forward button

3422
02:58:28,223 --> 02:58:30,783
I know this is

3423
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:33,599
Well the thing is I'm trying but then at the same time

3424
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:36,927
Like every few days something important happen

3425
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:40,511
Like drug shows up in this episode

3426
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:43,839
Alex has VR Confederates narrative

3427
02:58:44,095 --> 02:58:48,959
Plus the day Ron Paul Rand Paul age

3428
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:50,751
Take it down and like this is

3429
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:52,543
The end of conservative

3430
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:53,567
Lake

3431
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:58,175
There's too much that ends up happening every few years

3432
02:58:58,431 --> 02:58:59,455
Used to be every free

3433
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:00,223
Few years

3434
02:59:01,503 --> 02:59:02,015
Something

3435
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,295
Socrate

3436
02:59:03,807 --> 02:59:05,599
You can just

3437
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:06,367
Inside the Box

3438
02:59:06,623 --> 02:59:07,135
But normally you

3439
02:59:09,183 --> 02:59:09,695
Few months

3440
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,231
It happens

3441
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:13,791
Every few days

3442
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:15,839
Crazy 8

3443
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:16,607
Blows

3444
02:59:17,119 --> 02:59:17,887
My my

3445
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:20,959
I don't even feel like we're worthy enough

3446
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:21,727
Oh boy

3447
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:22,751
To broadcast

3448
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:24,799
What it is

3449
02:59:25,055 --> 02:59:25,567
That we are looking

3450
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:27,103
Right and it happens

3451
02:59:27,871 --> 02:59:28,639
Everything

3452
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:30,687
I mean we record

3453
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:31,711
Every couple

3454
02:59:32,991 --> 02:59:33,503
Every

3455
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:35,807
Couple of days we record

3456
02:59:36,063 --> 02:59:36,575
This park

3457
02:59:37,599 --> 02:59:38,111
Sometimes

3458
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:39,391
Something

3459
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:42,463
Something Joe big hat

3460
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:49,887
I don't know how long I can do that I couldn't I was boring

3461
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:53,471
Myself he's got skills

3462
02:59:53,727 --> 02:59:55,775
Also he allows long Gap

3463
02:59:56,031 --> 02:59:57,055
That's true

3464
02:59:57,567 --> 02:59:58,079
But like

3465
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:00,895
I mean we know

3466
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:01,663
We get it

3467
03:00:02,175 --> 03:00:02,687
He loves Russia

3468
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:03,967
He loves Russia

3469
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:06,015
The end of its investigation

3470
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:07,807
Unreal

3471
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:09,855
Come down to marching orders from Russia

3472
03:00:10,111 --> 03:00:14,719
Well maybe not

3473
03:00:15,231 --> 03:00:15,743
We're all in for

3474
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:22,143
I think it's going to be a combination of that and the various people who like I think my initial

3475
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:23,423
Prediction is still

3476
03:00:23,679 --> 03:00:25,727
ShopRite

3477
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:28,031
I think there's the rush

3478
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:29,055
And then

3479
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:33,151
I think we saw earlier

3480
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:36,223
Steve pieczenik is going to show up on the show within the next few days

3481
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:41,343
Rodger stone is only like I think a month away from showing up probably

3482
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:44,159
December it's late October

3483
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:49,535
There's no way you don't show up within a month or so

3484
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:53,375
So even even what I just I think there's just these people lying to him

3485
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:58,495
And him taking in lies from State media in Russia that he's like

3486
03:00:58,751 --> 03:01:00,287
It's counter to CNN

3487
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:01,567
It must be true

3488
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:04,895
That's I think I think that's it

3489
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:08,479
I mean we're going to keep going cuz I like I said our predictions

3490
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:09,503
I've been wrong repeatedly

3491
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:12,575
I don't see how that's not

3492
03:01:13,087 --> 03:01:14,111
The picture that's taken shape

3493
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:14,879
It seems like

3494
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:15,647
Yeah

3495
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:19,999
The full throated 1776

3496
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:23,327
Again I doesn't happen right away

3497
03:01:23,583 --> 03:01:27,167
It might it could love it first

3498
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:27,935
Kind of thing

3499
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:34,335
I never saw the I never saw the actual interview with Alex

3500
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:36,383
The the current

3501
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:37,919
F******

3502
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:42,783
I never saw the

3503
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:45,343
I can't imagine it was already

3504
03:01:46,111 --> 03:01:46,879
That full like

3505
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:53,535
You're the Goddamn hero of this f****** world it wasn't that then I think it has to be I don't know because

3506
03:01:53,791 --> 03:01:56,863
I don't know I didn't listen to the shows around it

3507
03:01:58,911 --> 03:02:00,447
Just based on the psychology of trump

3508
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:02,239
I don't think that he would have

3509
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:04,543
The show

3510
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:05,311
No he was

3511
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:08,895
Turn off

3512
03:02:09,151 --> 03:02:12,223
Yeah

3513
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:13,759
Before Trump would

3514
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:15,551
Give him

3515
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:16,319
The time of day

3516
03:02:16,575 --> 03:02:17,343
Haha

3517
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:20,671
A little bit when he was on

3518
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:26,559
In the sense that he said your reputation is amazing in the future

3519
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:28,095
Speak witches lies about

3520
03:02:28,351 --> 03:02:29,887
Upon lies

3521
03:02:30,911 --> 03:02:32,447
You can strain himself a little bit

3522
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,215
Especially when it's

3523
03:02:33,471 --> 03:02:33,983
Comes to compliment

3524
03:02:34,751 --> 03:02:36,287
He always throws

3525
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:37,311
Superlatives

3526
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:39,359
In Flowery language on negatives

3527
03:02:39,871 --> 03:02:40,895
But when you compliment

3528
03:02:41,151 --> 03:02:41,663
Sing somebody

3529
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,199
I think he is probably

3530
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:45,503
Cuz

3531
03:02:46,527 --> 03:02:47,807
Who's

3532
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:51,903
Not worthy of compliment I don't know

3533
03:02:52,159 --> 03:02:55,487
Vocabulary when it comes to

3534
03:02:57,535 --> 03:02:59,071
But it like

3535
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:00,095
This is

3536
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:03,167
Supremely frustrating as a job for me

3537
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,215
Because I want to see real chain

3538
03:03:05,727 --> 03:03:06,495
I want the narrative

3539
03:03:07,519 --> 03:03:08,543
And I don't

3540
03:03:09,055 --> 03:03:09,567
I guess

3541
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:11,359
What it with the lesson is for me

3542
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:12,127
Is

3543
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:13,919
I thought the narrative

3544
03:03:14,175 --> 03:03:15,711
Of the investigation was

3545
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:17,247
Why did Alex Jones

3546
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:18,015
Support Trump

3547
03:03:18,527 --> 03:03:20,575
And it turns out the investigation

3548
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:22,111
Narrative

3549
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:24,159
Holyshit

3550
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:25,695
And of course

3551
03:03:25,951 --> 03:03:30,815
It's becoming very different than what we set out for

3552
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:33,375
I know we commented on that in the past but I like

3553
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,911
It can't be stated enough

3554
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:35,679
Like this is

3555
03:03:36,191 --> 03:03:37,727
Really weird this is f***** up

3556
03:03:37,983 --> 03:03:38,495
Super weird

3557
03:03:38,751 --> 03:03:39,263
We have art

3558
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:40,031
Arteon

3559
03:03:40,287 --> 03:03:41,055
Alex

3560
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:42,335
And guess what

3561
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:43,871
Our next episode

3562
03:03:44,127 --> 03:03:45,663
It's going to get even weirder

3563
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:46,431
Dammit

3564
03:03:46,687 --> 03:03:48,735
What are you doing on our next episode

3565
03:03:48,991 --> 03:03:49,503
We cover

3566
03:03:50,015 --> 03:03:51,807
The episode that includes

3567
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:53,343
Classic

3568
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:55,647
The gay bomb

3569
03:03:55,903 --> 03:03:59,487
Oh okay there we go

3570
03:03:59,743 --> 03:04:01,023
So get ready for that

3571
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:07,423
Ulta

3572
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:09,215
We should have said that three hours ago

3573
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:09,983
Totally

3574
03:04:11,263 --> 03:04:13,311
We suck where bad promoting

3575
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:19,711
North bar Chicago Illinois

3576
03:04:20,223 --> 03:04:21,503
It's over on North

3577
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:22,271
Avenue

3578
03:04:22,783 --> 03:04:23,807
And

3579
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:27,391
Yep no cover I believe

3580
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:31,999
I worked out all the details

3581
03:04:32,255 --> 03:04:34,303
It'll be drink specials

3582
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:35,583
Me some stand-up

3583
03:04:35,839 --> 03:04:37,887
3 hours

3584
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:46,079
Yeah it'll be a regular show

3585
03:04:46,335 --> 03:04:50,943
Know immediately rethought that we will

3586
03:04:51,199 --> 03:04:52,991
Wait a second wife

3587
03:04:53,247 --> 03:04:57,087
Greatest National tragedy episode

3588
03:04:57,343 --> 03:05:03,487
See what the world was like

3589
03:05:05,791 --> 03:05:09,631
But you were doing that if you want to find out more about the

3590
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:14,751
Links to the archives and a bunch of other stuff, our website

3591
03:05:21,407 --> 03:05:23,711
