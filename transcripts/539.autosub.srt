00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nick.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Is coming to my life

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
I'm pretty excited about

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
And that is

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Hot honey

11
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
I had

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,504
Reviews I was at the store

13
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,808
I don't understand

14
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
I was at the door

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
And I saw it on the shelf and I thought what the

16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
The f*** is that I never heard of it before

17
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
It is honey that's

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Confused with chili

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
And so it's spicy

20
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
It's so good

21
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
It is so good Delta like honey goes on

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
It goes on that honey next to it

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
But then also the Heat

24
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
It's great

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
You can add honey two things must

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
You can add honey to

27
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Mustard honey

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Honey

29
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
Honey my friend

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
I'll make some muscle honey I'll be right back

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
You might come around if you try a little bit of that in my room

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
It's so good

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,096
You know I've only had it on a bagel or two so far but there's so many things I want

34
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Explorer putting it on

Food-related

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Okay

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
This is

43
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
He's going to seem simple but

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Have you ever had a really good pair Dan

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
I love Paris

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Pears are the best butt

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
The shortest

48
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
. the shortest window of her

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Perfect roux

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
They turned pretty quick

51
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
He's either eating a heart

52
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
A or an

53
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
You must shoe long and it's mushy

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I would too yesterday

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
I need a pair at like

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Precise

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Five minute window

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Where was

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
What kind of parody look like an ant.

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,024
Not like a real green I don't like the brown pairs I realized as I started

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
To talk I don't know other kinds of

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
I don't even take

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Boss is one of them

64
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
No Basquiat was

65
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
That's

66
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
I don't I don't know Paris

67
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
I do love them

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
Incredible a little bit of shade

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
When I was younger with him a little bit

70
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
12

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm still actually little bitter a little raw

72
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
And I got air my grievances

73
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Paris

74
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
My dad

75
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
It is a huge fan of Jelly Belly

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Answer the Jelly Bellies were often in the house jelly beans of all kinds of flavors and of course is your a kid

77
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
People like the toasted marshmallow

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
That's the kind of thing people like they liked all these candy kind of flavors

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
My favorite was the juicy pear

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
The juicy pear it was the best I thought it was really good

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
And I took a lot of s*** for it

82
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,416
Damaged hair

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Left some deep wounds

84
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
So Jordan

Laura's baby needs to arrive now so she can take

107
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655

Thank you very much

00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
Make a little bit of a correction

115
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
What about our last episode

116
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
I want to talk about Stefan molyneux giving that speech

117
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
I thought that was a New Zealand and I kind of f*** that up

118
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
I completed two things in my head that was actually in Melbourne

119
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
But he gave that speech

120
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
And the reason that I got it mixed up with

121
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Because when they went on the

122
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Mister related

123
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
The speaker New Zealand

124
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Play music

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,983
Bright Ray Rice mixed up if I had my I apologize I got that

126
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567

127
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
To add to that yeah

128
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Australia

129
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,759
New Zealand tell Stefan molyneux to go f*** you like

130
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Jordan today

131
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
I felt like it's been awhile since we checked in with present-day Alex Jones and honestly I was getting

132
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Pretty happy

133
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,791
To have had that break from his uninspired ass broadcasting

134
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,655
I was actually kind of excited though to get back into the mud and see what his dumb ass was up to but

135
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Wouldn't you know it

136
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
I checked back in

137
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Owen Shroyer has been hosting Alex's show all this week

138
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
There's no new episodes of Alex's stuff to go over

139
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,455
As it turns out Alex is taken off for another work keishin

140
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
This this time heading up to Florida

141
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
To cover what he calls a mask Rebellion

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
That's taking place at a grocery store in the city of Naples

143
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,255
The store is called Oakes Farms seed to table and Alex may or may not be

144
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Bee broadcasting mini Special Report

145
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
From live inside the store

146
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Here is a little clip

147
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
Because the state is so freaking awesome

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Florida is awesome

149
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Florida

150
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Everybody shopping

151
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
You nearby like

152
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Talk to people

153
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,631
Southern Illinois at the American Legion where they're holding a math Drive

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
Play my cards right I might be able to

155
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
To go to a car dealership opening

156
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Record live

157
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
Alright wow

158
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
BoBoiBoy

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
Situation with this grocery store is actually kind of funny

160
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
It's actually not in the city of Naples

161
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Technically and if it were

162
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
It would not have a mask mandate

163
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Because the Naples City Council decided against

164
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Supposing one

165
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
Preferring instead to just make it a thing I strongly recommend

166
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
However this store is in North Naples

167
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
Which is about five miles north of city limits

168
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Any subject of the jurist

169
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Diction of the county

170
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
In this case Collier County

171
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Who do have a mask mandate

172
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
In place

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
That sucks the store's owner Alfie Oakes

174
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
This has been waging a protracted campaign against masks

175
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Something feels like this covid-19 stuff

176
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Is a hoax

177
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
I poked around the story a bit and honestly it's kind of cool

178
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Cookie cutter

179
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,367
Republican business owner making a mini celebrity of himself in the antemasque game and there's not much more to it

180
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Everything is about what you

181
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Should expect all the way down to him calling

182
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
George Floyd a quote

183
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
Graceville career criminal after he was killed

184
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Black lives matter is a hoax

185
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,959
Alright that led to the least County School District severing their contract

186
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Which prompted Oak

187
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Looks to sue the school district

188
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
450 million dollars

189
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
Claiming is all bigots do that their free speech have been filed

190
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Oh yeah

191
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
Of course I don't know what his contract with the school

192
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
When they're about being able to terminate the contract

193
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Because I don't

194
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
The Free Speech issue

195
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
In fact I would assume that

196
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Conservative

197
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
You should be in favor of the school district

198
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Being able to practice free association

199
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,959
Guys with some of their opposed to being connected to

200
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
I don't particularly care about Alfie Oakes

201
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
Nor do I care too much about Alex's very transparent

202
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Do vampiric leave

203
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Feast on the attention Oaks is getting at the moment

204
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,271
If Alex is done like a whole show from the grocery store

205
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Then you might be dealing with

206
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
An excited damn

207
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
As it stands this is just too little to get worked up about

208
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
It's really funny to imagine though going into a Whole Foods or a jewel and trying to get some produce and you hear a guy yelling about the UN

209
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Trying to kill the children while you're shopping

210
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Image of my head of Alex and Owen on supermarket

211
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Sweet together

212
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
And that be great

213
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Cry-Baby

214
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Fill it up with emerge

215
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Get the beans

216
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Do you like that wood

217
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,831
Elevate my customer experience

218
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
Not so I set out to find an episode

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
To make for the good people out there to enjoy and as luck would have it

220
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Wow it's been in Florida

221
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
He paid a visit to podcast in Miami called

222
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Flagrant 2

223
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
I watch this thinking maybe it would be good to cover and it's just

224
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Embarrassing basketball

225
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
No that's a flagrant ones

226
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
That is a real Park

227
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Castle

228
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
The guys from Hollywood handbook called Art

229
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
I'm talking about this being like flagrantly

230
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Free Speech offensive

231
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Talking

232
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Out of here

233
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
22in that

234
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
I watched it thinking maybe you'll be good like I said but I got nothing

235
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Alex is so f***** up

236
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
But it's not even fun

237
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
The guy who's throwing hatchets on Christmas Eve at his own cameras

238
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
His own Studio

239
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
It's fun

240
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
The guy who's

241
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Trying he's just trashed

242
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Annoying robbed about the ways to learn a Cristo

243
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Skull cover

244
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Conceiving is fun

245
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
This is not fun it's sad

246
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
There was a moment in the interview that Alex did a while back with Logan

247
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Paul where one of Logan

248
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
When's friends commented to Alex that he had a quote heavy poor

249
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
What are you getting another glass of booze

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
The tone wasn't like hey cool poor man

251
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
Concern in it like telling Alex to slow down

252
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
This interview has the opposite dry

253
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Where the hoes are laughing their asses off

254
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
So just celebrating

255
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
How basically incoherent Alex's becoming

256
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Alex Liza the host face about things like

257
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Sandy Hook

258
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Position on reparation

259
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
It was trading with these host to do absolutely no show prep

260
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Before interviewing propaganda

261
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
At the end of the thing what are those does a list of quest

262
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
For Alex like

263
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Was 9-11 a part-time job

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Which if

265
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Did you give you some

266
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Consent to the value and comedic Merit of this show

267
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,471
The interview was so bad that I don't even think that it rises to the level of

268
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Deserving criticism

269
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
I'm like the only thing that I heard in it that I thought was interesting was

270
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Alex really drunk

271
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,687
Trying to explain why we need to cut off all for it

272
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,391
Ron Paul still is a drunken soul

273
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
There's also a very very

274
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Just depressing

275
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Stretch where Alex is really drunk and he tries to

276
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Call Rogan a few times as a rogue

277
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
And Joe doesn't

278
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Answer it's such a mess

279
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Not worthwhile as an episode

280
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,079
Bro. Trying to figure out like what are we going to do and then I remember though that's right

281
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,967
There's another motherfuker I've been meaning to talk about very often

282
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Hey motherfuker is named Harrison

283
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
Oh no we're doing white nationalist happy hour with Harrison Smith in the morning

284
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Of the American Journal

285
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
Cowboy Harrison Smith he had caught my eye or a while back

286
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Because of first of all his

287
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Gleeful

288
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
The Patriots

289
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Taking over the capitol at January 6th

290
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
I meant also just listening to some of his shows

291
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
Hoover chip man

292
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Perdido Biggity

293
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,663
And so I decided I'm going to get back in see what he's been up to

294
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
I didn't think that this was a possibility for a while

295
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Cuz he's been gone

296
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
He just had the paternity leave

297
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
Oh you just had a baby congratulations Harrison

298
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,975
And he's been gone to Rob do have been hosting and Tom pappert have been hosting

299
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
And boy

300
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
No good

301
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
But now Harris

302
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Do white nationalists have

303
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Have to scream like

304
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Placement every time they have a kid

305
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,359
Probably like in the birthing room whenever the kid comes out there like it's breaching they have to be like take that great

306
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
Replacement there a very least they make little fun jokes

307
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
Alright here we go as you don't love me

308
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Anymore okay

309
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
There's one particular reason that I decided actually look at this particular Epps

310
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
What is March 10th

311
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
I turned

312
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
F***** up so we're actually going to have to listen to another thing

313
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
But here is the beginning of March 10th

314
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Still got some good

315
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Bucking music

316
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,871

Central

321
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Standard Time Alex Jones will be

322
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Taking over the broadcast from his

323
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Outpost in the state of Florida

324
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,839
Very excited to bring a lot of information to take your calls as well

325

And we do new sale at enforcer Taekwondo give you that information very shortly but her hair lighter

326
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,311
Let us begin as we always do with our Daily Dispatch roll the Stinger please

327
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
What

328
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
You got sound effect

329
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Wow we're doing

330
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
Machine okay

331
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,367
All right so this is directed by Quentin Tarantino and there's a fax in the

332
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
That's all I know

333
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Still love it I don't care

334
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
Is that intro music for like

335
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,703
The beginning of the shouts mellow as hell I think I pointed this out after our last time we talked about him

336
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
No no it's great but I was mad at the song that build and Kill Bill volume 2 or 60 as in Kill Bill

337
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
And that's why he knows what's up

338
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Course

339
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
The thing I think is really interesting is like that like

340
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Bbbbbbbb

341
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Okay

342
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Showing

343
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
The Berrics

344
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Bones

345
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Attempt

346
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
The Craft

347
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,887
And that's interesting cuz no one else really try to like read off headline

348
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
I don't really care it's a very boring second

349
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
The beginning of this episode he has a quite out pronounce

350
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Today's program

351
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Belaying out

352
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,735
What I think is a rather convincing argument for the fact that we are rapidly

353
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
Racing towards

354
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
A conflict

355
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
That I would call

356
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
World War 3

357
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
The lines are being drawn

358
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Embarrassing

359
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
A lot of posturing

360
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
That

361
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Portend

362
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Great Devastation in our future

363
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Has to do with China

364
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Ron

365
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
And the

366
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Western powers

367
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Aligning themselves

368
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Against

369
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Those

370
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
Those bad countries where the good at

371
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Also Harrison clearly hasn't gotten the memo

372
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,319
According to his buddies like Alex

373
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,183
The Cold War was World War 3 World War 4

374
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
So there's another one coming Harrison

375
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
Should be calling at World War 5

376
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Nazi still seem to be the bad

377
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
In this case I think that him music

378
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
World War 3 sounds a lot more exciting

379
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Really understand why Harrison would

380
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,311
Just go ahead and stick with that branding

381
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Joanna not only does Alfie

382
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
The Oaks

383
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Think that

384
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Floyd

385
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
No was that

386
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Criminal and blah blah blah

387
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Meanwhile d

388
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Election of

389
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Trial rather of Georgia

390
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Boyd

391
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Continue

392
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
To move forward and not more Revelations are being made releasing

393
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Of the

394
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Autopsy report has revealed

395
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Massive

396
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Amounts of

397
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Drugs in his system

398
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
And as they say no injuries

399
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
That would lead to death and other words

400
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Jeffrey Epstein

401
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
May not have killed himself

402
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
Looks like George Floyd did

403
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
This is nonsense

404
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
There aren't Revelations coming out about the case of this point because the trial is

405
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Still in the jury selection

406
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Enphase

407
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,559
The coroner's report in autopsy information that the public has access to the exact same information we've had for likes

408
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
6 months

409
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
It doesn't show what Harrison

410
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Sun is climbing

411
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
He's pretending there's a new piece of information

412
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Verifies is pre-existing talk

413
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
It's because he knows that no one in the audience demands better

414
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
And they already believe the Gorge

415
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Floyd's

416
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
There's no big deal

417
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,479
The Washington Post article about the upcoming trial on March 10th and here's what they had to say

418
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,831
When chauvin's trial for his alleged role in Floyd's tragic death

419
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,415
Up against much of the argument will Center instead on the autopsy

420
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Details

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Most specifically weather Fentanyl and underlying health condition

422
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Not the police officers action

423
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Stop Floyd heart

424
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Dreadlocks

425
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,935
7 experts and toxicology Cardiology and illegal drug use

426
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
Consulted by The Washington Post largely disagreed with that idea

427
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Most of them strenuously

428
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
All but one said the autopsy findings

429
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,175
Another court documents coupled with a well-known chain of events that evening

430
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,991
Made death by fentanyl overdose unlikely to mm

431
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Impossible

432
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
And the other one was just

433
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Is Rudy Giuliani wearing a

434
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
Experts on the matter are pretty

435
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,999
Pretty clear that what happened to Floyd doesn't resemble what happens in cases of opiate overdose

436
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
Which is why no one on the scene administered in a lock

437
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Song with they did have it

438
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
They had the drug that would be

439
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Be used in the case of an opiate

440
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Say half the overwhelming consensus is that

441
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
Although there were drugs in his system drugs were not the cause of

442
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
George Floyd's

443
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
As the wapo article points out this defense

444
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
Police

445
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Abused all the time

446
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
When they kill p

447
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Abused

448
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,367
The time

449
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
The King was on PCP

450
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
And that made him such a threat that it Justified

451
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
The police's actions

452
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,279
Is there something that they do in business

453
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
Harrison Smith essentially just

454
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
You know taking two

455
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Defense arguments

456
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Uncritically

457
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
And then also

458
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Toeing the line

459
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,287
For just sort of like exactly what cop

460
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Say all the time

461
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
This is

462
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
It's weird how pee

463
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,735
People are trying to litigate this like the NFL tries to litigate what

464
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Patches

465
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
Football movies

466
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
Forget all the way and you have to take one step

467
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,487
You have to make a football move whatever the f***

468
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
No no no no George Floyd is dead because of Derek Chauvin and

469
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
His buddies

470
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Vnd

471
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
There's no there's no

472
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
You can talk about how much

473
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
You know it's like

474
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:30,591
Diddy murder him a premeditated again or you can do all that stuff but now he was dead

475
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Because of those guys

476
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
And it 88 appears that even if there were

477
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Some sort of a like

478
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,159
If they're like this argument that is being made by Harrison or even

479
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
True

480
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
Then you still have negligent homicide

481
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
On the part of these cops who

482
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
Have that would have had a responsibility to address the medical condition

483
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
There was

484
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
Supposed to keep people alive now what's their job.

485
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
Protecting and serving I don't understand those words at all when applied

486
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
The cops

487
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
So

488
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:10,015
This show starts out a little bit slow I know Harrison has declared that World War 3 is upon us

489
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
And

490
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
I got to be honest I didn't make it to him

491
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
Explaining that if he did

492
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,512
Cuz I got I got sidetracked

493
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
The slow news day

494
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Yeah

495
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
This is this is just like there's like

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
Scattershot headlines until he goes

497
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
The calls

498
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
Here's another one of these these little

499
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Petty complaints

500
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
She has this one's about Biden

501
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Not giving a press conference

502
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
You can only imagine if

503
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
President Trump had dared

504
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
To go 50 days without

505
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Taking questions from the Press

506
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Cancellation to be having a bean impeaching him all ready for this

507
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:52,000
In February 2020 it was reported that it has been over 300 days until Trump at a formal press briefing so here's something go ahead and

508
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
Shut that stupid tone of his up his own ass

509
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
To make matters worse ABC News reported in September 2019 that not only had drop not done these Prescott

510
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Conferences quotes

511
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Months that the White House Press Secretary last game 2

512
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
The podium in a briefing room to

513
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Field questions

514
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
From report

515
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Yeah and if Biden have done that

516
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Wait what

517
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,040
I do think if I should face criticism

518
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
For not having press

519
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
Is enough or yet since I think it would

520
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
No it's a helpful piece

521
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Severe moving forward

522
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
The same criticism of trump when

523
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
And he was doing the same thing

524
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Because I think

525
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Transparency in availability

526
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
To the public

527
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Is it good thing to encourage in our leadership

528
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
Harrison Infowars don't really have any underlying belief

529
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,104
They just attack their predetermined enemies and glorify whoever they like at the moment regardless if they're doing

530
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
The same thing

531
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
Don't pretend that their hero didn't

532
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
Can actually do what the villain is now doing

533
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
But worse

534
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Not long ago because if they did acknowledge that

535
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,416
They have to explain why it wasn't a big deal for that went drop did the same thing with her so upset Biden

536
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
And that would unravel the game

537
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
It would really make thing

538
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Things difficult if you had to

539
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Sort of like a

540
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Position

541
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
But your whole that would really fuk up

542
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
Petoskey

543
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
You know what

544
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Maybe

545
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Maybe

546
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
There's something to this not having press conference okay

547
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
Perhaps again we can take another lesson from this witches

548
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
So maybe what Trump should have done

549
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Maybe that just

550
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,856
Cut off the press and you just do whatever the hell you want without taking questions without

551
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
Accepting criticism

552
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Harrison you're in lock

553
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
I've got great news

554
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
I've got great news

555
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
You can get rid of the Maybe

556
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Get rid of the water

557
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
This is so dumb you are talkin about a thing a man has done recently

558
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
If I

559
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Recall

560
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
Huger Network celebrated extensively yeah

561
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
I'm sorry way Trump is out of office but there's someone else who's in office

562
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Infowars

563
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Is warming up to quite a bit

564
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
And I person

565
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Is Marjorie Taylor Greene

566
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
And without it like to go to another video here

567
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
It's

568
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Marjorie Taylor Greene

569
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Talkin

570
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
On the floor of the Congress

571
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Yesterday

572
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,960
Turned out house resolution 8 and house resolution 1446

573
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Gun control red

574
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
Legislation

575
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
So it's really cool to see them warming up to Marjorie Taylor Greene

576
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,712
I definitely wouldn't have suspected that was the inevitable destination of the passive

577
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Begins with hero worshipping Ron Paul

578
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Anyway

579
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
Hr8 is about expanding background checks

580
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Checks are people first

581
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,464
Saint-gaudens the other Builder talking about is meant to close what's known as the

582
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Charleston Loop

583
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,328
Named after the 2015 shooting because it was how dylann roof

584
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
Was able to purchase the guns that are used

585
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
Skill 9 people

586
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
At the Emanuel African Methodist

587
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Episcopal Church

588
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
He shouldn't have been able to pass over our gun

589
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
Soundcheck what he did because of this Loop

590
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,128
See when you go by to go to buy a gun

591
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
Name is run through the national instant criminal background check

592
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
Which should provide a yes or no result within minutes

593
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,624
However in some cases the automated system runs into complications

594
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Can't make a determination

595
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
He needs case

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
The FBI who runs

597
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
System have 3 days

598
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
Provide a yes or no to the gun seller

599
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
And if they fail to give a determination in that time

600
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
The seller gets

601
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
To decide if they sell the guns or not

602
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
You better believe they almost always do cuz they're selling gun

603
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
Yeah I do appreciate that

604
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
Guns operate under the same laws as

605
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Pumpkins

606
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
Turn into carriages

607
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
This bill that Harrison

608
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Complaining about wood

609
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Change that window from

610
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
3 days 2

611
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
The 10 days to provide more oversight

612
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
Top things like future Dylan roofs having easy access

613
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
Consider this stat from a report put out by the center for America

614
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
In progress

615
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Quote

616
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
It 2018 4240 background checks were denied Nationwide after the three-day investigation

617
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
. elapsed

618
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
In at least

619
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
3906

620
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
See those cases

621
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
A gun was sold to the prohibited buyer at the

622
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
The discretion of the dealer requiring offers officer

623
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
From the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms

624
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Supposed to attempt to retrieve these guns

625
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
From individuals

626
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
With a potentially dangerous criminal

627
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
This loophole result in tons of people who shouldn't be allowed to have guns getting done

628
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Poses

629
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
Threat and also creates a ton of work and expense or the ATF

630
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
To try and correct

631
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
The mistakes

632
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Call

633
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
Clearly Too Short window of time being given for these background check system

634
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
To provide an answer

635
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
I'm really confused as to what

636
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Situations

637
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Require a

638
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Guns

639
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
That we cannot wait

640
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
For the FBI to give a determinate

641
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,000
I mean make him someone to 10 days or if year

642
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,328
It's someone's barging into your house you need a gun immediately perhaps

643
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,192
The background-check delay isn't going to help you one way or another whether they like it or not

644
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
No

645
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,288
Yeah even if you've missed out on hunting season this year

646
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Feel like that's your fault

647
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
You should have

648
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,176
Gone two weeks earlier earlier not a problem

649
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Yeah I I don't know

650
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
I think both of these bills are completely sensible

651
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,952
Wait to see Harrison try to attack them by not discussing the bills in detail at all and relying on a video of a qanon weirdo

652
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
To make his ark

653
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
It's just pathetic all you need to do

654
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Outrageously dumb

655
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
I got a recording I made of Marjorie Taylor

656
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Green's remarks on the house

657
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
House floor

658
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
So

659
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Harrison

660
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
But there's not enough

661
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,576
And I would suspect that this is because Rob do f***** up

662
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,696
I need this phone line full with got empty spaces here I'm not used to seeing this

663
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
I was hosting American journal for

664
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Little over a month

665
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,424
Wolf online 2 whole time I go away for 2 weeks take care of a new baby boy

666
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
Come back nobody's calling in this is unacceptable folks

667
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,360
I need your help I can't do this show by myself I need the info Warriors calling in

668
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
I suspect

669
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968
What we're going to learn about some of these callers

670
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:10,368
I have a very strong theory about why calls might have dropped out whenever Harrison laugh

671
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
It was on vacation

672
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
Cuz Rob do was like no Nazi

673
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
Please please yeah yeah that was that was that sound

674
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
That sound

675
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,656
Excuse me could you please get rid of everybody who says

676
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:28,032
Code words for Jew

677
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,920
I just think he's weird I think this is a weird dude

678
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,760
And that we will go to our first call we have Andy in California

679
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,600
About the upcoming Passover thing calling in and eat your on the air

680
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
This year

681
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
I knows that that Easter is Passover on

682
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
No it's not

683
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Yeah

684
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
We look at the

685
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
Deuteronomy

686
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
Play Chapter 38

687
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
I talked about the

688
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
And the second after chapter is

689
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Call Dad

690
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
That'll happen

691
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,656
Like a real shity God to me

692
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Sedation

693
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Jody got it

694
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
My face like well maybe this

695
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,904
Look at everything you guys talk about

696
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Cursive

697
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
It's not

698
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
Satanic organizations but not better doing it

699
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Definitely allows

700
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
So I guess you want to learn something

701
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
Easter and Passover are both religious

702
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
Observances that don't involve specific dates on our

703
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,440
Christmas Princeton like that's always observed on December twenty

704
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
That's because it's tied to our Khalid

705
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
Easter and Passover however are both observe base

706
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
Which results in the holidays lining up with different dates

707
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Every year

708
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
According to our Gregorian

709
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Easter is always the first Sunday after the first

710
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Full moon

711
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Unless you're following the Eastern Orthodox tradition

712
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,920
Because this issue that's too complicated to get into because Harrison in

713
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Touching on that aspect

714
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
The thing I want to get into it now we'll do it later I've had a lot to I've been quarreling with the Eastern Orthodox

715
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,696
Facts about this for a long time to leave you to that

716
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
Passover is based on the Hebrew calendar which

717
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
Tintern is lunar base

718
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Send begins in the middle of the Hebrew month

719
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
Nissan in last

720
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Typically because of how these days are

721
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
End up being very close to each other and very often

722
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
Easter does fall within the week of Paso

723
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
This year Easter is on the last day of Passover April 4th

724
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Which I guess the

725
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,504
This color thinks mean something nefarious I don't know

726
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
It's very interesting according to Harris

727
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,672
Is blood moons all over 100% blood moon

728
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,304
The more important aspect of this collar I think is how much he's internalized the underlying message of a lot of Alex's rhetoric

729
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
There are demons up

730
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Sure but the curse

731
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
That are plaguing everyone are the results of God letting the stuff happen

732
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Because you aren't

733
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
Good enough for him to

734
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Protect

735
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
This is the messaging of cult

736
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,152
And it's very present in Alex's contact with his regular Outburst about how the world deserve to

737
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Bird

738
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
For things like allowing abortion

739
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Yeah

740
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Ridiculous

741
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Yep if you're if all of us don't act in

742
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
50 cordwell all of us will be

743
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
Who killed his protection and then you go here come

744
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
Cups and it's your fault operates under the same laws as like a teacher and if your stew

745
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
Student who didn't bring enough gum for the class well everybody

746
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Emmanuel

747
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Sent the hell everybody knows

748
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
Conceivably it's your fault

749
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,920
As an individual because you didn't

750
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
What is bringing gum

751
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
Glass metaphor for in this case

752
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Basically

753
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:27,904
Setting up a religiously ordered Society

754
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,256
Overthrown the teacher brutally deposed her and murdered her

755
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
And then God would have showered you with all the gum in the world and it's a little bit worrying when you start to think about

756
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
The ramifications of it

757
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Internalizing

758
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,776
The blame for God's Wrath

759
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
So Harrison starts talking about how the Pope

760
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
You know that Global spoke

761
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
You going to jail for well over a year

762
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Yeah

763
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
According to experts

764
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,392
What about that that I've seen going around

765
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,744
Respectful

766
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
Steve pieczenik arrested the pope like a year ago

767
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Augusta fake Pope

768
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
Somebody pretending to be the pope recently

769
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,544
I guess an interview had said that your climate change

770
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
He's possibly going to

771
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
To cause another flood

772
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Comments are what they are and whatever

773
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
Took that very simply and calmly as him saying that there would be a regular flood

774
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,696
The pope is calling God a liar

775
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
That because of climate change

776
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
We Face threats

777
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Avenue

778
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Flood

779
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
From God

780
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Now

781
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,728
I don't know what maybe I was just a child maybe I

782
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
Misunderstood

783
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
But wasn't one of the key aspects of the flood

784
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
That God promised never

785
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
To do it again

786
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,944
Wasn't that a promise God made

787
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
And is the pope calling God a liar

788
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
Got a liar

789
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
Now we'll get into this here in a second but

790
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,416
I think is really interesting as the Harrison starts

791
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Speaking about the flood

792
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Start thinking about the

793
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
The flood story

794
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
Are you getting mad about no no no

795
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
The original reason that God flooded the Earth was

796
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Sexual immorality

797
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,800
What does the pope have to say about that I'm pretty sure he has to say about that is don't worry about it

798
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
It's fine

799
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
Come on free Love Boat

800
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
This is interesting to me because

801
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
The flood in the Bible happen

802
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
It's pretty early

803
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Pretty fast in Genesis chapter

804
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,600
So I decided I would go back and refresh my memory about the lead-up to

805
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
The flood

806
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
And see if it happened because

807
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
People weren't f****** the way that God wants us to

808
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:43,072
So Genesis one is the creation of the world and then Chapter 20 The Making of Adam and Eve

809
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,680
Genesis 30 the fall of Adam and Eve had eaten from the Tree of knowledge

810
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Retaliation got made

811
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Snakes all slithery

812
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
That one was guest written by

813
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
C.s. Lewis created

814
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
Painful childbirth male-dominated relations

815
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Egypt structures

816
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,968
And I also turned gotten to Adam into a farmer

817
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
Really important

818
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
Get the male-dominated social Starboy

819
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
Right away

820
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,720
Rick from the first chapter been rule everything I'm moving on

821
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,048
It's going to hurt when you whisper

822
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
Very weird

823
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
Prices for deals of Cain killing Abel and then there's a bunch of

824
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
The names of the family tree

825
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
Genesis 5 is a bunch more names and how long they

826
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
They lived Bridging the Gap from Adam

827
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
In Genesis 6

828
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,968
It's God gets a little bit tired of people who decides they should be living so long

829
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,576
In addition to that he sees that quote sons of God where Marianne Koch Daughters of human

830
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
Which I guess is supposed to mean that Angels were breeding with human

831
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Strange that there aren't any lady angels

832
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,328
But I'll get off my sjw story about Dan come on now

833
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
Kirin here's Genesis 6

834
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
It's verses 5 through 7

835
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Quote

836
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race would be

837
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Become on Earth

838
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
And that every inclination of the thoughts

839
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Of the human heart was only Evil all the

840
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the Earth

841
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
His heart was deeply troubled

842
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,808
So the Lord said I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I've created

843
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
And with them the animals and the birds

844
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
The creatures that move along the ground for I regret

845
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
That I have made them

846
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
Wait hold on God real

847
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
Bisquick question God

848
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
Adjust we're in the planning stages I can see that you're reacting emotionally

849
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,984
And frankly I think it's a little bit offensive of you to say that they're acting evil all of the time

850
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
I mean come on

851
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
Also what did the birds do

852
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Burger King now

853
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
Well I mean look

854
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,992
If you wanted to turn the birds that's your business standing beef

855
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,184
I'm not going to go to bed for that but I am going to say that I was reading over this and it struck me how weird this is that like

856
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
You know it's a big decision

857
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
And to create a race

858
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,328
Human system

859
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
It's very weird that God wouldn't see it coming that he would regret doing that

860
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Open strings to fit into the

861
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,016
Conception of a God is over gret over the creation of humor

862
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Wolfman

863
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,880
Those guys were s***

864
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Whoops to Doodle very weird

865
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,000
And by the way even if like

866
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
God was justified in being disappointed by humans

867
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,144
Is extermination a rational solution to that problem

868
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
After all it was God

869
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
That created human

870
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
And so wiping them out is really just him trying to cover up his own mistakes

871
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
No no

872
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
That brings us to Noah

873
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
Godlike Noah because he was on like the rest of the people

874
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
From Genesis 6

875
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
611

876
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
Now the Earth was corrupt in God's item was full of violence

877
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Gotsoccer up the Earth head

878
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Become for all the people on Earth that corrupted their ways

879
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,512
So God said to Noah I'm going to put an end to all people for the Earth is filled with

880
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Violence because of them

881
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Why isn't 3 versus the

882
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
The complaint of violence has raised in relation to gods

883
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Kill everyone off with a

884
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Weirdly

885
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,312
Sexual impropriety isn't brought up at all it is odd that God would care more about

886
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
Violence than sexual impropriety Betsy

887
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
I'm so weird

888
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,456
After Noah built the ark and saves all the animals

889
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,272
Before I do, they have to live on that boat

890
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,576
That's comically oversized for about a year

891
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,392
No is 600 years old

892
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
When the flood end

893
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Noah gets off the boat makes

894
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
An altar to God which pleases God

895
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,072
Appreciation God says quote never again will I curse

896
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
The ground because

897
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
Humans even though every inclination of the human heart

898
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Is evil from childhood

899
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
I never again will I do

900
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
Destroy all living creatures as I have done

901
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
This story is f***** up

902
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,640
But the promise that God makes at the end of it doesn't preclude God from cause

903
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Avocado flooding

904
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
That we would see arise

905
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Climate change

906
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
People aren't suggest

907
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
We're going to end up in Waterworld or something

908
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,600
I'm s*** just that there a lot of places that will become uninhabitable

909
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
This will lead to master

910
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Displacement likely a lot of death

911
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
That's completely compatible with God's promise

912
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
To never again.

913
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Play all living creatures

914
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,704
Harrison Smith is a dumb f*** religious zealot he's trying to repurpose religious stories to suit his extremist agenda

915
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
In this case is opposition

916
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
The lgbtq rights

917
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
And access to reproductive health

918
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,408
It's a pathetic display it honestly it's important to recognize that this

919
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Is not a new show

920
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,528
They aren't even really Conspiracy Theory shows at this point nope

921
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,600
Their extremist religious programming gets masquerading as something

922
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Open political Orbach

923
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
Conspiracy in order to make it more interesting and attractive to an audience

924
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
That would reject them instantly

925
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
If they were aware that the mess

926
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Message they were being delivered

927
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
And was being pushed

928
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
To that was religious

929
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
It's a nature

930
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Please get these guys on this like this

931
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Podcast for they're all drunk

932
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
If they realize what was behind Alex's

933
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
Rhetoric and like with messaging

934
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
And how it was really large leaf

935
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't think they would think this was as funny

936
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
I know we had a lot of fun but

937
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,832
Just to remind you the Earth is only 10,000 years old into

938
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,904
Your sinfulness is going to get you sent to Hell forever

939
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Anyways

940
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
Aborted baby

941
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
I know I'm

942
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
I'm three-quarters of the way through this bottle of Jameson

943
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
But I should tell you

944
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Kamiakin

945
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
Conception of Angels and Demons

946
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
How serious it is I can see the

947
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,544
You know when you read the the biblical flood myth

948
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
You really start to think

949
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,664
Was this written by a dude

950
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Cuz I think

951
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
Pillsbury dude written

952
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
Weird to go back and

953
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
And read it after a long time and it's been it's been quite a while

954
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,000
Like the story directly from the source

955
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
I don't know baby

956
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
I don't know what it is

957
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
About my brain but I

958
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
I can pick out little things that I missed

959
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,264
But I was younger like that's a weird detail

960
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,872
Isn't it isn't it really kind of strange when you when you sit down in like grapple with

961
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
Reality and end like where we are is a society now

962
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
And you look back in your like

963
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
So are you telling me that I was

964
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
When I was a child

965
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
That God just a rash

966
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Definitely murdered everything and I'm like

967
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,792
And that's the guy I need to worship until I die

968
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
Is that part of the story is really underplayer really not important

969
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
I do think

970
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,472
They're still like some metaphorical value in terms of

971
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
You know I don't know

972
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Steadfastness

973
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
Faithfulness

974
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,408
Or just an educational Value Inn

975
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,224
Learning about how people explain disasters

976
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,808
Throughout illogical

977
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
I agree I agree

978
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
I think it'll be interesting

979
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Back in my Bible study groups or Sunday School

980
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Disgusting

981
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Ramifications of

982
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Extermination

983
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,656
And there are so many better flood myth

984
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
To the only

985
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,264
Is there actual flood everybody's got a flood myth around

986
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,616
The time the explanation I remember is like they're all bad

987
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:56,223
100 100

988
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
The jump in the Bible it's like well listen

989
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
Killing everything that evil is on the

990
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Yeah

991
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Harrison believes

992
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
On some level that the motivation

993
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Behind

994
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
The flood

995
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Read on God's part

996
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
It was something

997
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
The effect

998
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Of

999
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Something related to lgbtq

1000
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Thank you

1001
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Are you might be

1002
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,359
Inflating the story of Sodom and Gomorrah

1003
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
Of course and I think the reason that he's doing that is

1004
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
Cuz he doesn't actually remember the flood myth

1005
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
Maybe not but he does remember that the rainbow is a sign of God's covenant everybody

1006
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
Course you look at that

1007
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,743
That you know the Indian Christian mythology I guess you could call it the rainbow

1008
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
Was the sign from God

1009
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,071
As a promise that he would never

1010
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Flood the Earth again so just think about this that you have

1011
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
God flooding the Earth because of sexual

1012
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
Immorality

1013
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
And then you have

1014
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
The symbol of this

1015
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,455
The symbol of his promise to never do it again has been co-opted by

1016
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
Alternative sexual lifestyles

1017
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
Satanic

1018
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
To its very core

1019
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
I have to say

1020
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
What that is as interesting as

1021
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
Is Easter and Passover happening on the same day

1022
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,095
Is he trying to say if it's people turned over the rainbow

1023
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
But that's what he said

1024
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
But beyond that I think what he's saying is that

1025
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
People who have quote-unquote

1026
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,311
Alternative lifestyles are immoral

1027
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,663
You saying that he's not immoral to be

1028
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
Lesbian okay

1029
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Yeah

1030
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
That's cool I mean I guess

1031
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:42,207
On that position then there isn't because

1032
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
You are saying yeah

1033
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,887
That's f***** up just come out and say that you think everybody was not straight should be put to the sword like you're God.

1034
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,495
I think Harrison might be only a little ways away from that

1035
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
So we get another color here and this color blue like

1036
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
I'm still reeling

1037
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
From that okay

1038
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
This is a minute-long

1039
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Listen to the mic down for this

1040
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247

That is not

1087
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
That is not that it doesn't sound like a plan

1088
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
Did something like that guy was just a little bit High

1089
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
It is a little bit High

1090
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,767
I think I could have guessed

1091
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
Felt like he was bagela

1092
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Yeah but he ended

1093
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,399
The call felt like maybe there's something else he's like after

1094
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,031
Could you call in to the show and just because

1095
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,383
I guess I guess to let everybody know that it gets you high

1096
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
What a waste of time

1097
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Anyway

1098
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759

1099
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783

1100
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
By talking about

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Because I thought

1106
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
That this was the episode

1107
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,703

00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,575
This caller is then proceeded to really freak me out

1116
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647

Media silence

What are we doing

1150
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,247
This is very rich when he said Westboro Baptist Church

00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,647
What's going on here is this caller

1153
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,743
The beginning of the trouble with that

1154
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,535
Oh boy

1155
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Put forth

1156
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
The theory

1157
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Who is deposition

1158
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
The January

6 was

1160
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
The beginning of the second American Revolution

1161
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:50,335
And I hate to Mike down you twice since you're going to scream

1162
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,175
January 6th 2021 is going to go in American history

1163
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
It's a second amount

1164
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
As American Revolution

1165
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,599
It's going to be the chemical up at the beginning of it

1166
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,951
American people are being pursued

1167
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
When you come

1168
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Bi

1169
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
Targets are threatened

1170
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,543
Because they don't like them

1171
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
Canyons

1172
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
They don't like your thought process

1173
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,991
Sprouts of a dinosaur

1174
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Specifically

1175
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
About our government

1176
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,183
It's controlled by a pack of

1177
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
Is the Rothschild Bank

1178
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
Just sent you the moment

1179
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
With the Rothschild

1180
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Surprised we talk

1181
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Capitals Wild Water

1182
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
International jewelry is a

1183
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,007
Is involved

1184
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
What would stop get stopped

1185
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
I'm not talking about

1186
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Albuquerque

1187
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
International

1188
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Oh boy

1189
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,967
Is off the rail

1190
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Wow

1191
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
I feel like

1192
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Okay I feel like

1193
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
When Rob Deuce I was thinking

1194
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,975
He knows to hang up on people who says Zionist occupied government

1195
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
Let me be clear on what that means

1196
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:18,655
I believe the moment you talk about is our blood what that means

1197
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,823
Brandon is supposed to be that we're against that kind of stuff

1198
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:31,711
In order to support that kind of stuff we have to be pretend to be a Deadpool

1199
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Subway

1200
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,295
International jewelry my friend

1201
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
I have never heard that in a

1202
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Positive way

1203
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:44,255
Whoever has ever heard you celebrate the international

1204
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,839
Ford

1205
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:53,215
To put out

1206
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,311
This is not say nothing

1207
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,127
And I would argue buddy

1208
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Just I mean and look

1209
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
I'm going to go out on a limb here

1210
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,551
And I'm going to say that he's very mad at the FBI for choosing

1211
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Take me to Prost

1212
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
Go after people

1213
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Who don't share his opinion

1214
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
Now

1215
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Feeling that he was a big fan of jid

1216
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Edgar Hoover's that's

1217
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
You know

1218
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
Maybe he's probably a fan of the FBI murdering people who would say things like black lives matter

1219
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
The tide was so

1220
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Count minutes

1221
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,127
I need the

1222
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,967
We're trying to root out communist sympathizers everywhere

1223
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
Willing to bet there'll be a slightly different tone

1224
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Bitdefender

1225
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
Is that this dude

1226
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Is

1227
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
F****** over

1228
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
He doesn't give a s***

1229
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
He is

1230
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,279
He's putting it all out there

1231
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,095
Regular everyday everyday

1232
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
Because he's so comfortable

1233
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
Floating all this

1234
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
Stuff

1235
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
He kind of

1236
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,543
Makes clear something that we already know

1237
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
I know

1238
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
I know exactly what he

1239
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Globalist

1240
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
I think of the Rothschilds

1241
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
I always think of the product

1242
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
Pushing forward

1243
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
New World Order

1244
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,631
Call the Jew World Order

1245
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
He laughed at that

1246
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,311
Harrah's Harrison laughed at this guy saying the Jew World Order

1247
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
Is straight-up

1248
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,735
This is a region that's a real nothing how is this happening on air that is

1249
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:46,623
Nazi broadcast

1250
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
The game a little bit whenever I hear Alex a globalist I know what he's talking about

1251
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,839
I have a weird reaction to that because

1252
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,375
Chris Martin that made me feel like

1253
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
Well good for you buddy

1254
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
You understand what

1255
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
He saying

1256
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,031
That's it's nice that he at least can read

1257
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
Between the lines I don't know if many people can

1258
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,919
Can do that I think it's bad but he can

1259
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
And does and believe

1260
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Is that it okay

1261
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,551
Experience that I had was

1262
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Like taking no duh

1263
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,623
But like I'm so

1264
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,415
I'm so dull or numb

1265
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
Go to the fact that like that is

1266
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
The code that

1267
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:27,327
The characterization that Alex uses the globalist relies so much on these archaic forms

1268
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
Hades meditrope

1269
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
I get that I know that

1270
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
Intuit

1271
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
Surprise me

1272
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:41,151
Shocking to hear somebody just be like come on let's talk honestly no it is weird yeah it's really weird

1273
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:46,015
It's strange because it does indicate that I mean this guy isn't the only person in the audio

1274
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
Who has a

1275
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
Cognizant

1276
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Sort of

1277
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
Self-awareness

1278
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,463
But that's what he thinks Alex is talking about

1279
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
Everything

1280
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,143
Why do you think we use the code word

1281
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,031
So we don't sound like this don't sound like this

1282
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Damn it dude

1283
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,359
This guy

1284
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
Materials that he might want to promote

1285
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Talk to the audience

1286
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,759
If you pass dispensary

1287
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
And want some

1288
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
What's going on

1289
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Please call

1290
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647

Identity politics

Text2meme

1296

Sure I don't care I really don't care I'll make any of the things you know better

1297
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,575

Real

Promote the protocols home

1304
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
TV show

1305
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,567
You made this point before hang up on this guy

1306
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,383
She's Jesus

1307
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,431
Christ anyway I Harrison

1308
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Not

1309
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
One to shy away

1310
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,343
How is it that people are bitching about banning books at

1311
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,391
The protocols still isn't man

1312
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,695
Yeah.

1313
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:35,071
Sparbar

1314
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Like

1315
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
Push back

1316
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Too much

1317
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
On this guy

1318
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,007
Okay but yeah let me just say you know it's ensuring that you

1319
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
You bring it up with

1320
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
Exactly 10 things

1321
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,151
I was going to mention yesterday that I didn't get to us to a roads is the fact that

1322
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,991
The organization's who are actually advising

1323
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:59,391
The FBI on what to do I mean you don't Central you have the FBI and you would think that they would be answerable only

1324
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
To politicians that would be taking

1325
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,487
Directives from civilian oversight

1326
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,095
But in reality what you see and there's stories going back all the way to 2017

1327
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,703
Is that organizations like the ADL in the splc that are actually directing

1328
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
The FBI

1329
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,543
Call Maryellen

1330
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Jewish organizations

1331
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,687
They're calling themselves that right so you have an organization that is

1332
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,271
You know of a certain ideology is not

1333
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,623
Claiming to know before everybody's Anti-Defamation League it's a Jewish organization

1334
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,671
And yet they're the ones who are directing

1335
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,951
The FBI now

1336
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,327
Is it there is a weird sort of disconnecting the American psyche

1337
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
Where it's like

1338
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:44,447
How do we not see the dad weird and wrong that is a private organization

1339
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:49,567
That I consider a hate group that has articles about me calling me an anti-semite calling me a homophobe

1340
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,127
Calling me racist let me all sorts of horrible things

1341
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
They're completely untrue and totally baseless

1342
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
Yeah that's that's a little top Bachelorette on

1343
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Previous

1344
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,071
How would they have known any of these things they claim if they had not list

1345
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,631
Listen to me speak for the previous 10 minutes

1346
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,167
Wowzers

1347
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,007
Wow

1348
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,055
Insinuating

1349
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
International jewelry is a cabal that

1350
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,503
It's trying to push the Jew World Order

1351
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,295
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

1352
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
And then

1353
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,367
If you then respond with

1354
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
Hey you know the splc

1355
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,999
Cnat our Jewish organizations and they were on our FBI

1356
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
And there is a hate group

1357
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
It runs our

1358
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:49,215
Hey buddy you are signing off on with this

1359
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,775
Disagreeing with him this isn't a debate this isn't

1360
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
An airing of

1361
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,871
Alternative ideas that you have you guys are just

1362
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Both

1363
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Yeah

1364
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Out there

1365
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
It is it is interesting the difference in react

1366
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,855
Between cuz I feel like now that they're all just letting it out

1367
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Just like Hey we're Nazis

1368
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,231
How you guys doing well let's have a conversation about Nazi

1369
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
I like

1370
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
I can feel my

1371
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
I guard being lowered a little bit

1372
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,863
Because I'm not like

1373
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
I'm not like

1374
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
What is this supposed to mean

1375
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,775
You know what in what way are they trying to hide and what were they trying to lie

1376
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
Yeah however I have

1377
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,151
Let my guard down there and put it up to fight

1378
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Cuz I would like to fight

1379
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
I want

1380
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,759
Like a moment you're just like a wheel of be enough

1381
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,575
Then you're fair game

1382
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,111
You know like it

1383
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Brutal

1384
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,695
SMS

1385
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,255
Henderson does have one robot

1386
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
That I would say

1387
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
He gives and it's just to protect the business

1388
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
It's just

1389
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
Protect the game

1390
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
He has to disagree

1391
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Globalist

1392
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Means

1393
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,383
International Jewish person in the FBI's

1394
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,455
Bring that to the conversation

1395
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
Until I do disagree with you there where it's like

1396
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
It's not

1397
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,367
It's a certain thing it's an

1398
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Very particular thing

1399
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
That

1400
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:17,279
You can subscribe to whatever religion you are and you doesn't mean you subscribe to it if you're Jewish

1401
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
I do disagree with you

1402
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Certain points

1403
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:27,007
That's not even what that guy was saying responding to a false point in order to try and protect the

1404
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
The Infowars

1405
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
Usevs

1406
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
Globalization

1407
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
Dog whistle

1408
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
Listen to the rest of us

1409
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,855
I don't listen to this show much

1410
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
And then I dip in and there's

1411
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
This

1412
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Like I

1413
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,791
I think you are going to be a lot of my diet in the future

1414
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Just

1415
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Straight up not

1416
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
So

1417
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:58,495
I got through that call and listen to a little bit more and I just started to get bored I was like

1418
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
I am so overwhelmed

1419
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,847
By that call

1420
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,663
How over an offense if it was

1421
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Nothing

1422
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Is going to be worse than

1423
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,039
I can't imagine it'll be worth

1424
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
The interview that I was looking for was on the other day

1425
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
Yeah so I turned this episode off and run over

1426
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
You didn't wait to see if somebody called in and said the Holocaust didn't happen that Jews are also responsible for all the problem

1427
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Homes in the world

1428
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
I don't think it was a call that might been a guest I could've been Harris

1429
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,871
So I went to be the interview with Stewart Roads cuz there's some news about him

1430
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Recently

1431
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
Related to the six

1432
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
Right right right

1433
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Super cool dude

1434
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
Very cool

1435
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
I never wanted any violence at all wanted to check

1436
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
On his response to it

1437
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,183
And I thought it was interesting that it's on

1438
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
The American Journal

1439
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,511
But that's good

1440
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
The grocery

1441
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Yeah store

1442
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,655
So here we find the introduction to Stewart's interview and

1443
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,007
Bad ideas this is also

1444
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:10,175
Again you have to regret jingly admire the ability of mainstream media

1445
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
In the corrupt establishment

1446
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
Their ability to

1447
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,575
Manipulate the minds of the American people

1448
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,647
Especially when it comes to an event like January 6th

1449
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
2021

1450
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,511
It was a force as more information coming out

1451
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
We know

1452
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,071
Inside Job

1453
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,631
Same way that 9/11 was an inside job 16

1454
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
Was an inside job

1455
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:35,519
Flashback to the Capitol

1456
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:39,359
Don't even want to listen to our coverage of January 6th

1457
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,663
Was very different

1458
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,967
Do Patriots have taken the capital

1459
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:48,063
This is him doing the I don't know why the splc thinks were race

1460
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
It's a little bit it's

1461
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
2

1462
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
Take with a straight face

1463
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975
Like I don't really believe

1464
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511
Any sincerity here

1465
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Not all f*** Harris

1466
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
So he gets

1467
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
Talking about they said the marked are the generous

1468
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,679
Six protest Amy Says something that is categorically not true

1469
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,495
What was occurring there was the largest

1470
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
A protest

1471
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
I believe in American history

1472
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,615
The most number of people

1473
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,175
Ever together in a single place for a

1474
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Political

1475
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Nuvent probably upwards of

1476
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
A million if I had to guess

1477
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
That's not true

1478
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
I believe is doing a

1479
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,855
Heavy lifting job Annabelle

1480
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,159
Quite a few believe that that was the big

1481
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
Store comes in

1482
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
Has to say

1483
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
About

1484
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,095
But all these people were talking about your noise

1485
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
But how was it interact

1486
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
They're going for your head man I mean what is it been like for you

1487
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,007
Well it is

1488
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
It's been like

1489
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,615
Orwell's 1984

1490
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Thoughtcrime

1491
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,967
Space crime

1492
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,015
And all the things that we've seen in the past

1493
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Not being done

1494
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
Not just me but anybody else who

1495
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,231
As you were saying earlier there were no weapons

1496
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
No one brought

1497
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
John's

1498
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,559
Insurrection is that

1499
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,351
Frankly it's an insult

1500
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,959
Football

1501
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Planned insurrection

1502
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,103
Doster road is coming on the show to try to get out in front of some pretty damning information that

1503
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
Just been released

1504
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Related

1505
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
To the US's case against Thomas Caldwell

1506
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,759
I know keeper who was arrested related to the storm

1507
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Capital

1508
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,671
Caldwell it made a motion to reconsider his detention and this document that was filed in the evening of March 8th was a

1509
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Response to that motion

1510
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
There's nothing that's in here

1511
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,143
The first thing that's important to remember is that the charge this guy is facing his conspiracy to quotes stop delay and Hinder

1512
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
Congress is certification of the Electoral College vote

1513
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
That's Keith

1514
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,287
Because the conspiracy wasn't to storm the building

1515
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,079
The storming of the building was quote

1516
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,127
An overt act in furtherance of the

1517
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
Conspiracy

1518
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,943
Regardless of when they formed the intent

1519
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
The prosecution isn't claimed anyone can

1520
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Inspired to storm the capitol Jeff

1521
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,367
Conspire to make it so Congress couldn't

1522
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
Carry out its work

1523
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,719
This should scare the s*** out of someone like Stewart Road

1524
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Yeah cuz

1525
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
He did that

1526
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,583
The reason I could scare him is that this filing also reveals

1527
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
That the government is in possession of logs

1528
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
From a signal chat

1529
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Entitled

1530
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703

January 6th

1532

21

1533
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
Which was previously undisclosed

1534
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Caldwell himself is not

1535
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615
Been proven to have internet

1536
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,175
Snapchat but Jessica Watkins as well as another

1537
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,503
I understand person who were both Keepers were arrested

1538
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
West Caldwell

1539
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Worried

1540
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,879
Password multiple quote Regional

1541
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,439
Keeper L from multiple States across the country

1542
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
And Stewart Road

1543
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Who would have

1544
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,071
The people who believe that the government

1545
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
What is surveilling them at all times

1546
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
I'm trying to constantly and plant them with

1547
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,727
To track them

1548
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Would have

1549
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Absolutely no idea that the government

1550
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
Actually read these f****** conversation

1551
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
These chat logs

1552
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,407
Clearly show that Stewart Road was in

1553
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,711
Contact with multiple people associated with you

1554
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,503
Goalkeeper who stormed the capitol

1555
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,135
It also establishes fairly well that they were all involved in a plan to mess with the certification of Electoral College votes

1556
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Based on the publicly available evidence

1557
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
Looks like Stuart could get rolled up in this

1558
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,559
Conspiracy charge should the government want to pursue that

1559
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
The full extent of the cats aren't disclosed

1560
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,655
Elizabeth Stewart did tell the group quote

1561
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,447
We have several well-equipped

1562
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Quick reaction

1563
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Enforces out

1564
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
Outside DC

1565
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,799
There are many many others for

1566
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:25,151
From other groups will be watching and waiting on the outside in case of worst-case scenarios

1567
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
Famous people that have weapons

1568
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
Because they had a plan

1569
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,015
Involved heavily armed backup

1570
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,807
Yeah they didn't have

1571
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:38,207
He's in the Capitol because we were keeping them outside of the Cavalier use on people who try to escape the capital dummies

1572
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,071
January 3rd Thomas Caldwell send a message to three percenter group asking quote

1573
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,167
How many people either in the militia or not who are still supportive of our efforts

1574
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
To save the Republic

1575
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,751
Have a boat on a trailer that could handle the Potomac

1576
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
Bookcrossing

1577
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,847
If we had someone standing by at a dock ramp we could have our quick

1578
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,383
Response team with a heavy weapon

1579
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
I'm standing by

1580
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,479
Quickly load them and Ferry them across the river to our waiting arms

1581
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
Event set maps to people alleged to have been part of his

1582
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
Wow that does

1583
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
I wonder and we clear

1584
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,975
I'm just spitballing here I'm not being sarcastic or facetious at all

1585
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:15,071
I'm just curious I wonder if this dude got the idea to use the Potomac from list

1586
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
Sling to Alex's show

1587
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
December 3rd

1588
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
First episode of Alex's show just

1589
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,983
Days before Caldwell tried to get this boat plan

1590
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Together

1591
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Alex

1592
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,311
The color on the show suggest

1593
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
Did this

1594
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,151
Just wanted to touch bases with you with the

1595
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,455
March on DC or the occupation of

1596
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
DC

1597
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
I think that you

1598
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,295
I'm going to talk to all

1599
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,623
The Cajun Navy and all these people that did boat parade

1600
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
For the past

1601
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
324 mud

1602
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,279
We need to have every single one of those people

1603
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Plug up

1604
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
The Potomac

1605
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,679
Because you know that

1606
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,263
Like and I can sit out

1607
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Facebook post

1608
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
Yeah well I'm sure they can especially like

1609
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,039
The Cajun Navy when the hurricanes come in they have to go in there

1610
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
And I'll get people out

1611
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,951
I agree we need to see the Cajun Navy come in and then get on the grounds that I totally agree

1612
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:20,095
I'm looking at it if they tie up those boating that they try to shut down those bridges and that's a free

1613
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
You can get in

1614
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
At the public area

1615
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,775
Cayucos ghost they tried to shut down those bridges just imagine the info or Army

1616
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:33,151
Let me tell you what this is about it's about global governments about lockdowns about control that's what the whole

1617
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Covid hoax about

1618
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Exchange of the subs

1619
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
They're a little bit

1620
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
It's not quite the

1621
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
The same thing

1622
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,879
This caller is talking about clogging the river with a boat

1623
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
The fairy wepa

1624
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,439
But there are some similarities

1625
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
What's being suggest

1626
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:51,583
Clearly this caller doesn't mean that the entire River should be clogged up but that these boats

1627
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,655
To tie together in Block the area off

1628
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,935
To Infowars types

1629
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,239
Cross the river in the event that the bridges were

1630
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
L p Mattox

1631
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,847
Similarities to what Caldwell was trying to achieve

1632
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,503
Probably not connected in any way I just thought it was really interesting really good and went to staff

1633
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
Before

1634
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
Maybe this is just kind of how

1635
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
These folks mind

1636
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,415
To work your parallel thinking in terms of like

1637
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,463
Well alright we could use the river

1638
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,303
Yeah if you don't seem like these are plans that they like

1639
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,887
Cobbled together from half-remembered war movies from

1640
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:31,519
The song something like I remember from Bridge on the River Kwai

1641
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,359
Anyway the point here is that store road is going to have a really

1642
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Interesting year

1643
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:42,527
And it also makes a whole lot more sense why he's trying to promote Jessica Watkins legal defense fund after the 6th

1644
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,551
Yeah that doesn't

1645
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
Scentsy app

1646
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
So

1647
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
He has a bit of a lie

1648
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Right here about

1649
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
The signal messages

1650
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,023
The only thing I've got is a message

1651
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,583
Army person on our operational chat

1652
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
Arm signal saying

1653
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Anybody

1654
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Donna

1655
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
PSG

1656
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
Come to the north

1657
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
East corner of a capitalist route standing

1658
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
Rendezvous there

1659
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
What's the make sure

1660
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Guys stayed out of trouble

1661
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
This is a lie

1662
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,991
On 1138 on January 6th

1663
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,271
Stewart posted in that chat

1664
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,319
Quote all I see Trump doing is

1665
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Complaining

1666
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
I see no intent by him to do anything

1667
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,951
So the Patriots are taking it into their own hands they've had enough

1668
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
Later Stewart send a message to the to regroup on the south side of the capital not the Northeast side is he saying you're on the show

1669
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
241

1670
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,727
Stewart posted a photo of the southeast side of the capitol

1671
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
Caption quotes

1672
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,335
Southside if u.s. Capital Patriots pounding on Doors

1673
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
By that point multiple people in the chat

1674
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,431
Had entered the US Capitol

1675
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
See how this shakes out and everything but stewardess

1676
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
Is totally full of s***

1677
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
That's outrageous

1678
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Stats bot

1679
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
Yep

1680
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:56,255
It's interesting because Stuart has a little bit of a new kind of Defense

1681
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Here

1682
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
Listen to this

1683
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
Alright

1684
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Give you some

1685
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
Think about why you listen

1686
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
Okay

1687
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Assume he's telling the

1688
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,079
I will do my best

1689
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,359
Ask yourself

1690
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,407
If he's telling the truth

1691
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
This okay okay

1692
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
We had a situation

1693
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
Pembroke North Carolina

1694
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Sadly

1695
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,879
North Carolina

1696
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
Acquired

1697
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
Clear Choice

1698
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
In d.c.

1699
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
Call January

1700
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,143
Not going to have any national

1701
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
Or take part

1702
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,287
I'm a post Valentine

1703
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Remember

1704
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Screenshot

1705
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
So there's that

1706
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
So there's that

1707
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
Right so Carolina

1708
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Okay

1709
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Okay

1710
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
So

1711
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
Look guys

1712
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,439
What so I built this organization ride to entirely around right-wing violence

1713
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
Sand and and

1714
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,023
A super-strong distrust

1715
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:07,423
Centralization and then strangely enough one chapter went rogue and decided

1716
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,823
I had no control over that essentially declared State that's cool

1717
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
Cool I've created these heavily armed

1718
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:22,527
Mini Army and cooperate with me

1719
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:28,415
Accidentally created Warlords by bad guys my bad I created roving bands of Warlord

1720
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,975
Really a huge mistake on my part

1721
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:36,863
Exactly wondering why people don't like what you do

1722
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:43,519
Oh okay so you guys were talked about the warlord problem now I see what you were talking about

1723
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,799
Create these

1724
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,591
Loosely connected

1725
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,663
Proof of RVs what effect might go Rogue

1726
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:55,039
Crazy lionizing a leaderless resistance

1727
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
It seems that they don't want to follow my

1728
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
My leadership for summer

1729
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:03,231
Is true and like let's say that the North Carolina crew was responsible

1730
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
I still think Stewart you get sued

1731
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,839
Yeah I think you still create the whole shebang

1732
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:11,935
Say like whoops by group went rogue it happen

1733
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Sam

1734
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,799
Rugs

1735
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,847
Accountability there

1736
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
In this next clip Stewart misrepresents

1737
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
With the government's

1738
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:26,271
Keep in mind that the charge that this will keep replacing is

1739
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
Related to

1740
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
Conspiracy to obstruct

1741
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,367
Interfere with

1742
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,927
The electoral vote

1743
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
They're trying to say that

1744
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
We

1745
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,839
The election was stolen

1746
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,143
Anyone election was stolen

1747
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,191
Encourage people to go to d.c.

1748
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
And then like

1749
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
We did courage Trump

1750
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,543
The Insurrection Act

1751
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,359
We said itchy does we're going to serve

1752
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
As the militia

1753
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Which is a

1754
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
An illegal act

1755
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Fresno

1756
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,295
Beautiful dancer

1757
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
He calls us up

1758
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,135
Federal law as the militia

1759
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
Call Cindy service

1760
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
Is every right

1761
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Before you do so

1762
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
No they're not

1763
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
No

1764
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,679
That's not at all what they're they're doing already

1765
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,727
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

1766
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
No it's

1767
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Everybody

1768
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,823
Could say come to DC

1769
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,127
Anybody can say come be a part of this protest

1770
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Can't

1771
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
Can't

1772
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,271
Conspire to interfere with Congress as business

1773
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
What you actually can

1774
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
Yeah as long as you don't do any

1775
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
Right you can

1776
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
8 /

1777
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Sports

1778
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
Furtherance of the conspiracy

1779
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,071
See here's what my defense would be my defense would be

1780
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
It was a non violent

1781
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,887
Island protest now the problem with that.

1782
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Is that it

1783
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Wasn't right

1784
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,751
So that kind of changes your

1785
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:57,151
Yeah you know like it if nothing had happened and they were loving this charge to stop the

1786
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,431
Nothing happened

1787
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:02,015
We didn't do anything we didn't go anywhere

1788
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,599
The capital has had a protest outside

1789
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Nobody said you know why you know why because Congress is ability to carry out the wouldn't

1790
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,959
No no it wouldn't be the cry

1791
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,263
Taken to further the conspiracy that

1792
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
Conspiracy wooden

1793
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
Be

1794
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,431
Mistaking criminalizing the first

1795
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,223
Where you're like a

1796
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
We don't like this thing

1797
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,807
Let's all get together and be like

1798
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
Whenever our problem

1799
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
Was the second part when they were like

1800
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,159
Let's go kill people

1801
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
That was that was my problem

1802
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,255
I don't like the combination of it

1803
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
But it's the second part that

1804
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,351
The legal problems

1805
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
Come back to bite

1806
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
Turns out

1807
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
Did because of what's happening and

1808
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
Prosecution of these people for

1809
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
Storming the capitol

1810
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
We are now living in

1811
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
Prostitution America

1812
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039
Right

1813
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,575

01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,647
Clear American

1816
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
You are

1817
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Not one

1818
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,975
Justice bands

1819
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
Of this so-called

1820
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
Just called in.

1821
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Department

1822
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Ghetto

1823
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,191
I don't know if this is one of those things

1824
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,215
F****** dramatic

1825
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,007
Yeah this is again

1826
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,311
The drama nonsense of these people

1827
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,895
Constitution America

1828
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,527
Spell

1829
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
So we can take those real quick I got bad news

1830
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,415
I got the quarter some soldiers were living it up

1831
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:51,071
Even more silly playing coward

1832
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
The thing that makes even more silly is that Harrison agrees with him

1833
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
I bet they were living

1834
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,959
Going to post Constitution America

1835
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,239
And then he plays a clip

1836
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
Of Marjorie Taylor Greene

1837
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,079
Talking about defending the Second Amendment

1838
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:06,175
Today representative Marjorie Taylor Greene congresswoman

1839
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,735
Rose to speak against

1840
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:14,879
Hr8 which is a natch National gun registration and HR 1446 which is a

1841
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,927
Permanent firearm waiting list

1842
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
So

1843
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
The Democrats are

1844
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
Coming after our

1845
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,303
Constitutionally-guaranteed rights

1846
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
1 after

1847
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,119
The other and there's no

1848
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,447
Sense of them slowing down only increasing their speed

1849
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:33,823
There's not constitutionally protected anymore according to you there's no Constitution

1850
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,919
You guys got to adjust your f****** rhetoric it is you're going to say we're living in a post

1851
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:41,247
Constitutional America

1852
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,343
Which one f*** your second amendment if it's most comforting

1853
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
The name that's all good

1854
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,695
Okay

1855
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
It's Underdog

1856
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
Yeah yeah

1857
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
Man f****** let's do this

1858
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:01,983
If you really sincerely believe Mad Max me let's go

1859
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Sincerely believe

1860
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
That

1861
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,591
The Constitution no longer applies wearing a postcard

1862
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Constitution America

1863
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,407
You're not just saying that to be

1864
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,735
A dramatic weirdo

1865
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,807
Then it should implicate a whole bunch of other boy

1866
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,623
You should no longer be talking about protecting

1867
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
In the Second Amendment because

1868
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
If there is no cost

1869
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
There's no

1870
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
The Constitution

1871
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
I guess you probably should

1872
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,327
Stop complaining about free speech

1873
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,935
Wow don't worry about that that's not guaranteed know anymore

1874
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
No and if you're going to stay post

1875
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,079
Constitutional America then essentially what you're saying is

1876
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
If we want

1877
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
The Constitution

1878
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
We're going to have

1879
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,735
To overthrow the government

1880
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,551
Write a new one or whatever

1881
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,135
Re-establish the old one but either way Altima

1882
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,975
You are saying we need to overthrow the United States government

1883
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
And the way we're going to do that

1884
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:59,327
According to Stuart

1885
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
It's disgusting to watch all the

1886
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,239
Bro everyone at the Capitol under the bus

1887
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,031
Condemn them all

1888
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,079
And the Democrats

1889
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,663
We have.

1890
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Looking party

1891
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,247
Start the bottom up

1892
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
You got a job

1893
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
Rhinos

1894
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
Call the coward

1895
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Or Traders

1896
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,951
Inspection report both

1897
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,487
Traitors and cowards

1898
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,023
You got a purge amount

1899
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
Real Patriots

1900
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
We got to get more of that

1901
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:38,495
Gallium or Marjorie Taylor Greene there

1902
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,055
Do not Stewart Roads for one second

1903
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,335
Can save it someone else's

1904
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
The coward

1905
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
For once

1906
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
1

1907
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
You're going on this show

1908
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,711
Lying about the ship

1909
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,991
That you did on the SEC

1910
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,551
If you were not a coward Stewart

1911
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:55,647
Can coward as Road you're into cover-your-ass mode self in

1912
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:00,511
You would have claimed that this whole thing is b******* and you would have said I'm going to stand and fight

1913
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,535
These f****** charges

1914
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:05,375
Because I'm not a coward you went on a radio show

1915
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,911
Maddie Goodwin

1916
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
City radio show

1917
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
I didn't do it

1918
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
They're going to blame me for stuff that I had

1919
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:19,968
Nothing to do with

1920
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,880
Trainers because the North Carolina goes with North Carolina guys went rogue and did all the things that we

1921
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,976
Constantly talk about doing is a bigger

1922
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
Then Stuart Road

1923
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
No no no no

1924
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,304
F******

1925
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,120
Marco Rubio

1926
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
Amanda Lang Republican

1927
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,544
They devote about get more Marjorie Taylor Greene

1928
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,688
Cowards now at what will the federal government did I didn't do anything but I will never take responsibility for any of my ex

1929
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,736
Also insinuate

1930
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
But even if that

1931
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
Goes through

1932
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
Are mites

1933
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
Going to really work with might help

1934
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,672
What a f*** is going to happen

1935
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,024
So we get towards the end of this interview and Harrison gives us

1936
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,072
You know basically like what the

1937
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,864
Mostly prelate

1938
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Actually about

1939
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,912
I want you to tell us

1940
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
Stewart what

1941
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:17,056
Like somebody was listening right now they see what's going on and they're thinking what do I do as soon as this program's over

1942
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,872
What do I do in Fort Worth store.com

1943
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
Dot-org

1944
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,712
But what can they do who do they call Ghostbuster

1945
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:32,160
How many more less of 40 minute infomercial for

1946
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
4

1947
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
Stewart Rhodes

1948
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Feigning

1949
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,256
Ignorance and innocence

1950
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,048
And then also trying to get my

1951
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
Just tell Stewart to take

1952
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
Take some of that f******

1953
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
And chill man

1954
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,216
Going to be dramatic about the post constitutional America

1955
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:51,616
We got some product to you the fuk down I will say

1956
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,200
City High

1957
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,320
I don't know I mean I have trouble sleeping sometimes maybe I should I mean

1958
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,344
No I will not

1959
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,904
I want to make this clear I have gotten this question a couple times

1960
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Recently

1961
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
We would have asked have I ever

1962
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,048
Tri Delta

1963
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
And we haven't

1964
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
Dressers in a while

1965
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,888
Nor would I ever

1966
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,448
Other people do those videos

1967
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,776
You can watch him they're Gravedigger better than us we're just going to be sad

1968
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,688
Realizing that we were doing that and then stab

1969
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,040
So we come to the end of this and what are the things that I really am

1970
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
Pretty insistent on

1971
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
In my own head

1972
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
Is going to be paying more attention to Harrison

1973
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
This dude is a real f******

1974
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
Bravo

1975
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
Nazi Nazi

1976
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,584
I mean the

1977
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
The kind of thing that is

1978
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,192
Apparently acceptable conversation on his show

1979
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Is

1980
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,056
Further than most of the time that you see on Alex's show

1981
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,592
Let's eat outrage

1982
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
The kind of thing

1983
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
Video viewer on here

1984
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,480
I did not think I would I would get to this point

1985
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,064
Harrison brought me here a lot faster than I was expecting

1986
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,648
I miss David Knight yeah

1987
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:14,304
Boring as hell boring but he wasn't knew how to walk that line and honestly I

1988
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,608
You know not to not to be too

1989
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,656
Explicit about my feelings about this

1990
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
I honestly think that this is revealing

1991
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,472
Doing too much

1992
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,776
I think that this is actually incredibly bad

1993
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,312
Strategy

1994
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,616
I think that this is bad for Infowars

1995
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,432
It appears to be a head poking up

1996
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
And I'm going to play whack-a-mole with

1997
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
Yep I'm going

1998
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
To pay more attention to him

1999
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
Because I think it's a

2000
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,344
Soft exposed underbelly

2001
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
And a f******

2002
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,184
Who doesn't know how to play the game Alex

2003
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
And Owen Shroyer clearly

2004
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,536
Play better where they can shut this stuff down

2005
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
They can give the appearance

2006
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:53,728
A signaling to these white nationalists 296

2007
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
Yes absolutely are

2008
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,336
Clearly either doesn't have the desire

2009
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
Or the ability

2010
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,664
Or the the smoothness

2011
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
To be able to

2012
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,736
Have all that in the

2013
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,272
The package of presentation

2014
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,600
That will probably see a lot of really

2015
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
Really f***** up stuff

2016
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,184
Yeah we we

2017
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
To joke about it though.

2018
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,000
One of the reasons that it was

2019
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,840
Edifying to watch Alex Jones

2020
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,144
Cuz Alex was the weakest link in the proper

2021
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:28,800
Harrison is the weakest link of the floors

2022
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:33,152
