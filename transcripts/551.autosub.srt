165
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
It doesn't matter in the scheme of things

So you can go harass them

188
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831

And other outlets

194
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,471
The defense Witnesses former home did happen

195
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Still seem to be embellishing a tiny bit

196
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
All over

197
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,967
To be clear I am against this kind of thing and it's counterproductive

198
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
According to an NBC news article the people responsible are being sought

199
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
And our quote accused of

200
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
So there's a decent chance someone's going to get in trouble

201
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
That being said I would be remiss if I didn't

202
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Fake outrage

203
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
In November 2020 Rodger Stone was on trial

204
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Potential jurors

205
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,895
For sure that the person he was naming on his show was actually even potential

206
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
He was still going to go ahead and put a Target on them

207
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
I am so

208
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Nobody else or lease it

209
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Appears to be

210
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,951
Appears to be who this person

211
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,047
Right I just still really feel like once you have put out a

212
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Bounty on somebody

213
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
And now they're mistreating them jewelry

214
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Do this whole big thing worth of Rodger Stone

215
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
You lose forever goodbye

216
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
Naturally Alex

217
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Insecure about his actions

218
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
Because it's a very clear attempt at dirty

219
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
November 6th

220
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,671
Keep in mind that Rodger would be found guilty until November 5th

221
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Teeth

222
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
This trial was still ongoing

223
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
Media Matters goes Jones

224
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Messenger

225
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
Completely legal and lawful

226
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
What time was the public figure

227
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
What if

228
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Call Doshi

229
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
Chelsea Clinton

230
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
One of their minions

231
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
We're going to release

232
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
Because that's what the Press does other than war on the Preston

233
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Hillary Clinton butt

234
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
That was just desperation talking

235
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
Rogers guilty Escape

236
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
She was really killing it she got her big break with Thelma and Louise yes convenient

237
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
Whenever you can just redefined public figure

238
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Dominion of my imaginary enemy

239
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,335
It's the people who threw a pig's head at that house

240
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
And I wouldn't be okay with that at all

241
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:21,087
That would fall into the same kind of category is Alex's Behavior

242
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
I'm still against

243
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
But the person who's former house

244
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
For the defense

245
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
30 given their testimony

246
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,351
You could argue that it was a retaliatory vandalism and I suspect that's why it's being

247
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Considered a felony

248
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
I do think that's different than trying to Intimidators

249
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Which is what I like

250
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Like 6 months ago

251
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
CBS also didn't.

252
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Anyone

253
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,223
Be local Minnesota Minnesota affiliate published an article that discusses the jurors brought speaking

254
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Just vaguely

255
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Details like

256
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,575
Their Age and information about their fur

257
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Perspectives

258
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
This is not the same thing as what Alex did

259
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
If Alex can show actual

260
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Instances of people showing up

261
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
But the jurors you should do that

262
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
But I can't find it

263
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Consider any of it

264
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Cancel that being a real thing

265
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,703
I suspect he's just taking that defense witness story and then make

266
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
Picking up another story on top of it

267
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
More fun I'm a huge fan of people who

268
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
You know really taken to Heart

269
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
The historical lessons about

270
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Intimidating Witnesses

271
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Misses being a thing that puts you on the side of

272
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
I think that's real history

273
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,951
Intimidating Witnesses very positive

274
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
History

275
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
Rodger when he was on trial Alex did this whole thing

276
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,679
Nonsensical

277
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Is hairball his show

278
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,311
Interesting when he doesn't bring this up when talking about the efforts

279
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
But some people have made to intimidate

280
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Surprise

281
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,223
Instead

282
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Talking about how

283
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
When he's spitting

284
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
Trial situation

285
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,951
I'm sorry the media is trying to

286
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
The situation

287
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
And said if you don't do the right thing

288
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Got your ass

289
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Corrupt

290
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Corporate media

291
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
The enemies of this country

292
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
I guess Alex

293
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Thinks he's a terrorist

294
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
I think Alex

295
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
Interesting

296
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,463
Episode

297
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Critiques

298
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
Has Maxine Waters

299
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Chewy

300
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Publix

301
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
About the sheriff

302
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Trial

303
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Grandstand

304
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Seawater sets

305
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
That's what civil rights looks like

306
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
But she didn't say a word about

307
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Muslims

308
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
A million

309
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,327
No no no no no one of the 14 black man killed

310
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Each year in wrongful situation

311
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
She'll make a huge deal about that all day

312
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
She's a monster

313
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
30 years ago in July

314
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
This country

315
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Plan

316
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Kill

317
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Weed

318
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
What

319
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
She really fun

320
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,079
Is the Republican Party exactly that

321
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
I just started on them

322
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,759
You think I feel strong as human watching them brainwashed

323
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Joe Biden

324
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,375
Those real

325
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,775
Is that Beyond

326
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,639
Dying

327
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,295
Ugly and they're stupid

328
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
Christian or Catholic

329
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,375
The Dirty Youth bear was my bad I spoke too soon my bad my bad

330
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,007
Is a loser

331
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
Come on man

332
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Appreciate

333
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,759
Conversation

334
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Dislike

335
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
The carceral state

336
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
End up becoming rant

337
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,999
It's about owls are all from the Devil

338
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
The devil

339
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Autism

340
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,679
Yes it looser is devil is doing great so far to be honest

341
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
Also incidentally Maxine Waters has spoken up consist

342
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Don't lie about the human rights

343
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
China

344
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,175
On September 30th 2020 house floor in support of the weaker Force labor disclosure Act

345
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
The 2020

346
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,319
The government of the People's Republic of China falsely refers to these concentration camps as vocational

347
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
Make no mistake the truth is that today

348
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,231
2020 BMW concentration camp

349
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Weatherbeeta

350
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Starved enforced

351
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
To work long hours and conditions

352
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Describe

353
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,887
Thank you man and we haven't even gotten to America

354
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,727
Their relatives often have no idea where they are or whether they are alive

355
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
Each day due to the cruelty of their living conditions

356
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
Chinese government

357
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Which executes them with impunity

358
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,967
Incidentally that Bill had five

359
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
All of them Democrat

360
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,367
Some of the house who voted nay on that

361
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
Louie gohmert

362
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
Why not

363
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
People like Maxine Waters don't ever deal with the issues that he wants them to deal with because

364
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
To trivialize things like the George Floyd killing

365
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
The reality is however that Alex is just making up everything

366
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
He says

367
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
He has no idea of Maxine Waters has spoken out publicly again

368
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Chinese human rights abuses

369
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
But the idea that

370
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,808
Hasn't is the only option that fits into how is content is supposed to

371
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
Is that feeling is more important than accurate reporting

372
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
That feeling is reported as fact

373
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Messages bad work cuz it's how we operate

374
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
It is the most in

375
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,096
Yuriatin part of the right-wing b*******

376
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
It's fear is that it's like

377
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
We only pay attention to these people whenever they do something we don't like so we have honestly no idea what

378
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,896
Whatsoever if she's ever spoken about China doesn't matter

379
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
I am only mad whenever

380
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
She speaks out about something that I care what is the disclosure Act of 2020

381
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
OK Google

382
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
So I know sometimes

383
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
I think you know now they were

384
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,520
Vaccines are going around there's a possibility of like a meeting a friend

385
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Right

386
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Kind of a

387
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Excited

388
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,224
There's a game in my future and I'm very excited

389
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Kindness

390
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
Syd Barrett

391
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Unless

392
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Very bad you're like Alex

393
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
Dinner with James

394
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,816
Really great guy.

395
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Fantastic crew

396
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
Cool of Liberties are indomitable

397
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
And it'll fighting Spirit it just makes me feel strong

398
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
That it was really great

399
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
I'm going to give you a big explosive tomorrow

400
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Another terrorist icon

401
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
That is breaking

402
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
10 minutes

403
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Infowars

404
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Dot-com

405
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
James O'Keefe operates on

406
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,912
Sing only and that is attention

407
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
If you're ever in a position where James O'Keefe is offering

408
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Exclusive you need to ask yourself

409
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
Some very serious questions about the legitimate

410
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Embassy of the story that he's trying to give

411
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
I am

412
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
100% sure

413
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
This man whose entire career is based

414
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
Off of lying to the people that he is speaking to at any given point in time for the sake of attention

415
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
A prophet I'm sure there's no way you would have Alex

416
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,936
But you like you got to be asking yourself like

417
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
Exclusive up on Project Veritas Alex

418
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
How is it

419
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
Possible

420
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
You can

421
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
The Infowars itself is blackballed on

422
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
The major right-wing conservative news network

423
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
O'Keefe can hang out with Alex

424
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,024
And then still be like Fox News is like look at the new O'Keefe Master P

425
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Good beef

426
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,384
It's not

427
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,736
Project Veritas

428
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
What significant event

429
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Terrorist

430
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Mexico

431
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
This is the third one in a couple weeks

432
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
This shutdown

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Get the article out

434
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,168
Kara project even if everything that's being said.

435
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't care about their scoop

436
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,800
I suspected terrorist was tracking arrested when they tried to enter the country

437
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,920
That's just a story that tells me the border security is pretty alright again

438
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:27,040
It's a failure ministration is ruining everything by catching terrorists

439
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Whatever they cross into this country

440
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:33,952
Also if I were James O'Keefe I probably shy away from stories like this about terrorists

441
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
They run the risk of reminding people about that time in 2014 when he dressed up as Osama Bin Laden and walked across a stretch of the Rio Grande

442
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,704
River supposedly illustrator

443
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Get to the country

444
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:50,848
It was super embarrassing and

445
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
I think this is a great idea

446
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,856
Mansion in the world again

447
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
And then I will say this

448
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,840
Player for costuming. Seems to be over in James O'Keefe's career

449
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Over to dress up

450
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Earlier

451
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,264
Dress up

452
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
To wear a suit

453
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
Dramatic

454
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,480
I hate him so much interview weirdos

455
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
The worst

456
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Yep

457
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,648
New social media censorship

458
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Going on here

459
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,000
All the usual

460
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
It also probably isn't true

461
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,632
Remove post by breonna Taylor's mother

462
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,960
Criticizing black lives matter say never helped

463
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
And they're full of crap

464
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
So now the mother and Brianna Taylor was killed wrongly

465
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Big Houston

466
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
He gets beat up

467
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
That's a lot of

468
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Protector

469
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
So you can see her Alex's position on the killing of Brianna Taylor his chain

470
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
Black lives matter

471
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,376
Because he's using the mask of being sympathetic

472
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:22,240
His attack on black lives matter

473
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
Zerorez

474
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Back for it

475
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
A couple quick fact-checks here though

476
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
Taylor's mother did not say the black lives matter was a fraud on the Louisville chapter of like

477
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
Matter what you said she also has never dealt with

478
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,136
Also there's no indication that Facebook took down her post

479
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,464
It's entirely possible that she removed herself there's no verification

480
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Turn on that

481
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,072
Paul was beaten up by his neighbor in 2017

482
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,936
And reports on the neighbors trial have called over a lawn care dispute

483
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,080
Taylor was killed on March 13th 2020

484
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
Retaliation for passing laws

485
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
Makes no sense and he's just grasping at straws

486
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Also

487
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:12,672
Paul's Payless 395 Vincent

488
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
June 2020

489
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
It is a dead bill

490
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
Paul has not succeeded him up for 3 years prior

491
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
I think

492
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,240
That's a fun with a long hair is it I think it's

493
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
They would be described as an existential incident

494
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
Insofar as I do not appreciate his

495
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,992
So that would just be my

496
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Sure

497
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
I feel like you might be the sort of cat who would like

498
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
Repeat

499
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
I just feel like it would be you would like

500
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Put poison on some of his yard that would spell out something really offensive maybe in the grass

501
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
David I would never have a pet that is still good

502
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
Trim his Bonsai into offensive

503
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
I think I could

504
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
Probably get it

505
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
And then you do like that gag

506
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
You got the bottle

507
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
Bucket of water on the door and you like

508
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864
And then somebody gets all that's terrible I get a crane

509
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
But like a really tall and then when he's walking

510
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
Getting out of his house in the morning I

511
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Just pee right on his head

512
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,104
And then whenever he's not sure what it is and he looks up

513
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
I would say that if you're doing that

514
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:47,136
You'd be playing with fire

515
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,936
Playing with fire

516
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Are you real bad

517
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Play with fire

518
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Call George

519
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
What did he say

520
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
He said

521
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
Isn't dangerous

522
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Fearful master

523
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
This isn't a real watch

524
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,192
Nope

525
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
The structure of discussing fire in this exact construction with the serpent master

526
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
1637 by the website investigator

527
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Was traced back to 50

528
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
62

529
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
The first time this

530
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Your turn of phrase accredited to washing

531
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
Engine was in

532
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
Science journal

533
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Consistently credited to wash

534
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Washington since then

535
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Just another example of Alex

536
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Man I think that one

537
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,848
Probably goes all the way back to like 150,000 years ago whenever it was just like Ugh and that man is hot

538
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Runaway

539
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,968
You can use fire for things but also it can f*** you

540
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,112
When I got really excited cuz you know

541
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
And the way that Alex was doing be like

542
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
Don't play with fire

543
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
I learned not to play fire

544
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,520
I got really excited and then

545
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
Sure the ones

546
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
Fire

547
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,200
The one letting it out of the box

548
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Almost always the one burned

549
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
Fire at doesn't sound true at all

550
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
Safire

551
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
You are not in command of the fire

552
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
I wasn't ready for the fire to be the devil

553
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
I really wasn't

554
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,704
I reserved posted on my own

555
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
How silly it is to use

556
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
I also changed

557
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Spectrum

558
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
All right you don't embrace it your respect

559
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
To the devil

560
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,864
What do you think got to keep Bucyrus think of that candy login.

561
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
I always appreciate it

562
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Really lose

563
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
This is the thread while trying to do lyrics

564
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:25,248
Combines turn this into

565
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
A block a contact but then I have to do the last work

566
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
That's all

567
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Spoken Word album is

568
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Coming our way once he's off the air

569
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Disclaimer

570
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
This for me is just like

571
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
Every now and again you need like that cute moments

572
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
And I think that this is really

573
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,248
Because there is a war on for your mind

574
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
No no

575
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,560
Raleigh State Controller Tennyson

576
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,632
About out of them

577
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,408
Yes

578
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:30,528
PC has to start whistling in the middle of a sentence

579
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,112
That my friend does a human moment

580
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
That is very

581
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
So cute

582
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
On this episode

583
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
Except a little bit of a story

584
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
Divorce

585
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
From his wife

586
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Fungi

587
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
I think

588
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
How is it possible to turn this racist

589
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
Because I feel that's where we're going

590
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,808
Deep into that later is more

591
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
I don't even know what it is

592
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
I think the story Alex is trying to tell

593
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Is

594
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
A couple of really hot ladies

595
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
After he was getting divorce right come on

596
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Hot lady

597
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
I invited him to a drag show

598
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Women

599
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Divorce

600
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Condos

601
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
Said hey what

602
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Contest

603
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
No no no this is this

604
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Was it North Austin

605
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
I'll go with you

606
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Gorgeous

607
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
What the hell this is like that these are men

608
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,688
I was there with all men

609
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Be a few here let's go

610
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
What

611
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:10,624
This story makes no sense

612
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Incoherent

613
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,536
Yeah I wonder what the reality of the story

614
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
It is it's it rings

615
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,448
True in the sense that I have no doubt that a certain point in his life

616
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
Someone invited him to a drag

617
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Show

618
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
That I would be

619
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,432
Feel strange

620
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
It doesn't sound like he knows what a drag show

621
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
It's possible I think he thinks that it's a burlesque

622
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Show Maybe

623
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
And it's not a drag show

624
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
It's taste

625
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Man

626
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,488
Isn't it sad that there's a certain part of me that's fine

627
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
It's so sad that if you're a

628
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Conservative

629
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
Christian white nationalist

630
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
You can't enjoy a drag show

631
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Which is one of the most joyous

632
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Places that I've

633
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
At a drag show

634
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
This story may or may not actually be true greatly embellished because

635
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,576
For him to get into bashing drag queen Story Hour

636
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
One of the things that I noticed that he does

637
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
All the time is basically says

638
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Reporters

639
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Who captured like

640
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
Pornographic

641
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Footage

642
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Of kids with

643
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
Naked man and stuff like that

644
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Antic

645
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Do you have

646
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
Everybody everywhere

647
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:43,296
Playing it on yourself

648
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
What children happen

649
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Kaiserslautern

650
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
I just couldn't imagine child

651
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,248
All on drugs are all sorts of crazy hormones

652
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
Doing all sorts

653
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Grounded

654
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Fifth

655
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Team minutes

656
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
Physically sick

657
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,656
Wow

658
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728
So much of that doesn't need to be part of the story

659
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
So much of it is like

660
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
Does detail still help with your story

661
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
It doesn't matter

662
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
How big is schlong

663
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
Any size long it's still illegal

664
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
I don't know if you

665
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
He said it was a major

666
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
That means

667
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,840
1-ranked away from giving him information

668
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
Is not a lieutenant colonel song

669
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,264
Yeah I don't know

670
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
Skip back to talking about

671
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
Anticipation is building

672
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,920
Maxine Waters

673
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Said sum

674
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Comments

675
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Is not into

676
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
But the judge

677
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,112
No he's interested in making this a mistrial

678
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
You see that judge up there

679
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
We all just listen to a congresswoman

680
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
We don't we don't need a mistrial

681
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Do you just have

682
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,864
Their houses last year

683
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Blood

684
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Shepherd's pie

685
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
About lawlessness in terrorism

686
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
And this mob French Revolution malice

687
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Bolshevik Revolution

688
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Revolution

689
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
Alex has yet to demonstrate or show any instances of jurors being Doctor Who

690
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
More seriously than I did the first time

691
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
There's another interesting thing

692
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Found not guilty

693
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
Some clips from newscast civilians in Minneapolis who are expressing that are likely Beyond

694
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
His chauvinism

695
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,928
It's really important difference here and it's one that I think Alex refuses to acknowledge

696
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
If the news goes out an interview

697
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
Use people and they say that they are

698
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
Likely be protest

699
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
The chauvinist found not guilty

700
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,144
Does Alex think that the new Supra

701
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
10 that they didn't

702
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,288
The goal is to represent the opinion of persons on the street that they talked to

703
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
It would seem like an irresponsible level of censorship

704
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
Just edit the responses to reflect what you would want them to say

705
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,992
But that seems to be what Alex wants to happen

706
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
Well be okay

707
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
So the person being interviewed

708
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Specific

709
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,232
Quickly that if Justice in this circumstance has denied it's so overwhelmingly obvious

710
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
It's what the verdict

711
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
Then I'm going to

712
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
Help people

713
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
No longer have a police precinct for a little while

714
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,080
And that was edited to be like a

715
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,736
I mean like really what's going on is

716
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Essentially

717
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,112
This is how Alex creates contact

718
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Alex

719
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720
Looks like blurbs

720
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
He has because the narrative he wants

721
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,168
Supercuts

722
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
Do you think the right way

723
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,080
Has actually convinced itself that the other side is doing what they're doing

724
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
I think Alex is probably the only

725
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
The same thing and

726
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Pretties alien differ

727
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Picks and chooses

728
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:11,327
Call me

729
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,911
Explain what you meant by the end of that sin

730
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Amazing

731
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
Alex is not racist as we've discussed

732
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Anytime

733
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
But usually in the reverse

734
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
He is

735
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,943
Yes

736
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
2030 White People three or four black people

737
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
That use a front-of-the-line

738
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,511
And then the black controllers

739
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,119
Allies in the back cuz they don't want them seen by wanted to look

740
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
The scapegoat

741
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
The blacks Wally start the race war

742
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Wow

743
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,079
Really

744
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
That was your chess game right there

745
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
I would say three moves is all it takes

746
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,063
Snowed a little bit more regularly in recent days

747
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
Is this a social justice

748
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,927
This causes are meant to incite racist backlash from

749
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
Orchestrated to do that by white people

750
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Escape goats

751
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
At the front of their action

752
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:20,447
This is a pretty outrageously racist idea

753
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,727
The last episode

754
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,311
This is very much in the same prediction is Alex's forefathers who fought against

755
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Be civil rights and

756
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,175
I realized in hindsight that maybe I should explain my point a little bit

757
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Further

758
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
Texas kind of giving me an opening to do just that

759
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Alex's favorite book

760
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
The one that turned him on to the new world order was called conspiracy by Gary Allan

761
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,255
12

762
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
A few years later got a bust

763
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Pregnant

764
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Honestly the timeline doesn't matter

765
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,655
This book is a primer that is

766
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Has been cited by many people

767
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
Richard Belzer

768
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Is being a revelation

769
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,943
A longtime member of the John Birch Society and wasn't his first

770
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Facebook

771
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
Sleep Revolution in the

772
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Switch is a scave

773
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,111
Very racist attack on the Civil Rights Movement

774
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,607
The idea we're secretly not actually black

775
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
Actually communist

776
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Front

777
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
Typically run by wife

778
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:29,055
Just in case any white people reading this are concerned about unequal treatment

779
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
Treatment let's just

780
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:36,223
100% get rid of that idea that race even existed just white people versus

781
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
33

782
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,391
We arrived at the interesting possibility that the black Muslims were started by the Communists

783
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,487
Knowing that the majority of American Negroes felt a kinship with Soviet Russia

784
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,887
Establishing a religion based on

785
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
A revolutionary

786
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
States without the majority people realize

787
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
Significant

788
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Probably surprisingly

789
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Never actually just

790
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
Defies this cloak interesting possibility

791
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
Because as he goes on to say

792
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,807
If the black Muslims were Communists set up from the beginning

793
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
It's doubtful that any but the very top oligarchy were aware

794
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,975
That's some classic style proof right there

795
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
This thing is true and I can't prove it because only the top level of the conspiracy that I swear is real has that

796
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:31,263
Because previous and former professors

797
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
I mean you could

798
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
All of them are dead

799
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
Can trust that I'm Gray

800
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
You understand this

801
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,575
Construction that he's using his basically to prove the basis for my conspiracy in the suspicion

802
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,903
Assume the existence of the very conspiracy that I've failed to prove it

803
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
It's it's

804
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
No it's him

805
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
That if I'm right

806
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,375
You would already know or if my information was

807
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
You would have already

808
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,495
This runs constantly throughout his book

809
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
Vegetation by revolutionaries civil rights leaders

810
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
We're willing to trade the citizen safety

811
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
For the vote of a minority block

812
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Every group is

813
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,111
The front every event does Inside by communist

814
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,951
48 / 0

815
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Thesis

816
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Quote

817
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:28,095
The Communists have been working for over 30 years on in America

818
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,399
Their efforts of usually fail because Negroes

819
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
Prove to be loyal America

820
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,239
But this is not caused it communist

821
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
The slacking

822
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
Because they see civil rights as America

823
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Achilles heel

824
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
How many grow is the sacrificial cannon fodder

825
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
For a communist instigated Revel

826
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,527
This is the exact same rhetoric that Alex Jones uses

827
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Civil Rights Movement

828
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
And Martin Luther King back

829
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
60 up

830
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,559
Challenge Alex to reflect on his moral lesson 121 overlap between his

831
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
This protest

832
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,911
Used to take social justice

833
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Protester my country's recent

834
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
I mean you could again

835
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
This goes back to slavery this goes all the way back to them being like well there's no way that slaves could ever

836
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
Organize on their own

837
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
So it must be white

838
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
Because they don't like us having all the money it sure it goes all the way back

839
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Yeah

840
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
There

841
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
I choose to focus this

842
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,351
Because this is part of Alex's intellectual tradition

843
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
Anti-communism had

844
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,007
This is the world that Alex espouses

845
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,079
Very deeply communism stuff

846
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,919
This routing of something that he needs to

847
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,735
Stop

848
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
Bike

849
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
It's nonsense

850
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
You can't have

851
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,903
You can't play the exact same game but your forefathers did it again

852
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Civil Rights Movement

853
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
And pretend like

854
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
That's not what you're doing

855
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
It's not about communist

856
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:06,655
So Alex has reflection and everyone in his orbit pretend

857
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Books like

858
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Communist Revolution in history

859
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Don't exist

860
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Because they make it too obvious

861
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,311
But like I said communism

862
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,615
Call Justin

863
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
They used to hide behind

864
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,551
Yeah absolutely whenever Communists as use it as an excuse to Jews in Hollywood

865
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
It's not like J Edgar Hoover was like

866
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
This'll never work against black people

867
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,255
Just to give you some

868
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
Idea

869
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
Little

870
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
People want

871
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
People to read

872
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Looks like this

873
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:44,031
It was very hard to find my phone

874
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
From another

875
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
The University's private Library

876
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
But I got it for like a week and was able to photo

877
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Costco

878
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
It's

879
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Buried

880
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,575
Because it's super sensitive

881
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,183
Terrifyingly racist thing I've read

882
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,279
Very similar to

883
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
Loretta record Alex Jones

884
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,447
These are the things like backlight replacement Siri in there

885
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
We'll get there sooner or later

886
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Alex Goes to College

887
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
It's going to happen with this verdict

888
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
What do you think

889
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,295
Okay so

890
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
Hungary

891
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Scared

892
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Skinwalkers common

893
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Even though

894
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
Phone is blowing up on trial

895
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,663
I think they told her to do that to hang with Sherry I agree to cause the blow up

896
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
Okay

897
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Precipitate

898
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,975
Here is going to be really upset about that

899
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
And it seems to be fairly consistent

900
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
Things change

901
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,055
Statement where he pretty much

902
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
The liberal media

903
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
Buying a boat

904
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
The whole time

905
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
Bill Maher is now a secret Patriot

906
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,543
I can't

907
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
That should that the breaking

908
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Pretty much

909
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,759
Regular Democrat

910
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
Before this

911
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,207
Shooting range

912
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
No heat

913
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
I can't think of a

914
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,143
Where is he

915
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:37,343
Isn't that political philosophy

916
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Before

917
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,975
The only reason anyone would be some kind of a super liberalism position

918
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
I'm listening to Alex gallo.

919
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:51,679
Also Alex Tucker Carlson

920
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:57,567
Years Alex's used things

921
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,407
The whole thing globalist wanted to crash the economy to hurt Trump

922
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
That wasn't

923
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,503
Tireli based on a joke that bill Barr said on one of his shows

924
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:10,623
What does use Bill Maher's comments to such a prominent extent in his conspiracies

925
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,719
Explain bilmars role in global operations like this

926
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
Belmar

927
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,143
Results

928
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
Ventriloquist

929
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
Yeah it's basically a global

930
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
Program

931
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,151
I was just going to say whenever he said some people have been

932
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
I'm like

933
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
That is bring your job for 5 years

934
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Cheese's

935
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,831
Reversal for Belmar

936
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,391
If I believe the word that Alex

937
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:48,511
Bill Maher should be super assassin Squad

938
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
Ventriloquist dummy or some dumb s***

939
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
But it's made up that has matter something that he said on his last episode

940
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:02,079
Can guys eventually leave the globalist with other milk

941
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:11,039
At this point

942
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Norm

943
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,647
Stand-up comedy

944
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,791
Nobody else

945
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,351
Isn't schachter's

946
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Okay

947
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,663
Black lives matter

948
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Did the call

949
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
Again

950
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
Great Bear

951
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
What if your wife

952
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,903
Consistent

953
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
Sure people know that hey

954
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,535
Black lives matter to address burglary

955
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:58,911
Just to make sure everyone knows the number for black lives matter

956
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
Significantly longer than 911

957
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,591
Call the police to deal with racial Injustice

958
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:11,711
No deal with advocacy for cause

959
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,063
We've made an amazing point

960
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Had to do it

961
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Again

962
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Two back-to-back UPS open

963
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,327
Cuz little bit about the idea

964
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,399
Surgery for minors

965
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Less important

966
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
An exchange that happens at the end of this book

967
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Is

968
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
So heartbreaking

969
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
It is so sad

970
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
We cherish

971
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
We were in a situation where parents

972
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
Could be accused

973
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
Risk of injury to a minor

974
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
Their minor children

975
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
Exchange operations

976
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Absolutely insane

977
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,439
And I don't really know who

978
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,743
It's from

979
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,119
Well if young doubted that would be mine that would be one candidate

980
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,935
Oh my God you're a f****** lawyer

981
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Wilbur

982
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
This case be thrown out

983
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,247
Seeing as how half of the jury is

984
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Fakeness

985
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,575
How embarrassing would it be to be like

986
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
Well

987
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:28,255
Taken seriously sitting here with this dumb f*** out

988
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:34,143
Cui Bono is Satan

989
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
Seriously consider that perhaps somebody would benefit from not having the remote

990
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,895
Social life destroyed by their real

991
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,431
Star Pizza Temple

992
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
Alex has a disease

993
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
I think he has a

994
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Compulsion

995
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Sickness

996
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
Benediction

997
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
And that is

998
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
Whenever Norm pattis is on the show

999
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
Can't help himself

1000
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
Make declarations that

1001
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
Volvo million dollars

1002
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
Thaisub she's under light

1003
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
Press conference

1004
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,775
And she's got almost pure pupils

1005
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,335
Talk about Maxine walk to

1006
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
I need those eyes are

1007
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
What the hell is she on

1008
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
Bright lights in somebody's eyeball

1009
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
95% people

1010
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,935
Understand

1011
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,007
Pupil dilation

1012
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
It's remarkable I mean

1013
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,919
Still not a pattern

1014
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:56,063
Norm has been honor for two instances of Alex offering a million-dollar Bounty Zone Fitness

1015
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,743
Turn or might be like it's me about me am I so boring but I would hate to spice this up with millions of do

1016
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Dollars on the wall

1017
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
Well I think she's on self-righteous

1018
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,423
That's because I am not going to insist

1019
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,959
That she is on drugs

1020
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
Man

1021
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
Interesting

1022
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Appearance

1023
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,063
What is interesting is it

1024
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:35,487
Well the lawyer friend I think it's because

1025
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:40,351
Veterans Elementary

1026
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
Buchanan there are only two who will

1027
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,751
I might have accidentally skipped a minute or something because like

1028
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,823
Alex is in the middle of talking to Norm

1029
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
And then

1030
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:56,223
You talkin about

1031
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,527
Cheapest

1032
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,927
I couldn't tell and tell them back-to-back

1033
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
4 minutes

1034
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
Kind of figured out what was going on

1035
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
Is to not have mobs

1036
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
It's the

1037
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
It's the remedy

1038
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Inside

1039
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Jury

1040
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
Into a mob

1041
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
Jury trial

1042
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,599
Maybe they're gold

1043
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
Will be to ultimately replace juries

1044
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:40,255
Assault

1045
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,815
This should really threaten

1046
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,631
This is just as bad as going a free-speech or Gunn

1047
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
Control

1048
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Is the jury system

1049
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
Because it's ordinary

1050
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
Everyday People

1051
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
Coming together how are the Judiciary lies of the people

1052
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Is in the power

1053
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
The jury

1054
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,063
And it's a check on

1055
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
To check

1056
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,183
Media wants a power to misquote

1057
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,975
Miss miss

1058
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
Misrepresent and then

1059
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
The media wants to

1060
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
So I found this really interesting

1061
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,263
So what's going on here is just coming on the show

1062
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
The game of their playing

1063
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
I thought was really over

1064
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
What's going on here

1065
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,527
Beer that Alex has been building up to is one of a hung jury or an acquittal

1066
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
Because then there's going to be

1067
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Naturally

1068
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:43,487
This trial was essentially a setup to get people to the point where there will be riots

1069
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,119
That's where Alex's callers suspect them

1070
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,703
He's even said that he believes that Maxine Waters statements were intentionally made

1071
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,495
Deposit mistrial so there'll be riots

1072
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,543
But what if that doesn't happen

1073
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,895
You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket

1074
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
To provide the alternative narrative

1075
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,271
In case things don't go this whole episode

1076
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
In case Chauvin is found guilty

1077
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,111
Ameritas in place here

1078
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:15,487
Did Maxine Waters comments were essentially the creation of mob to replace

1079
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,279
Jury trials

1080
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
Until the verdict is read if you're a listener of Infowars you're being asked to believe that Maxine Waters comments were sign

1081
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,007
Chinese Lee and Bob Costas

1082
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,823
And also and needlessly complicated conspiracy

1083
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,871
Meant to cause a mistrial

1084
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,967
Infowars needs both of these to be true until the verdict come

1085
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
It's a Game of Thrones rose bush

1086
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,831
I do appreciate how is the audience

1087
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:46,207
Maybe he'll all of conservatives view everybody on the left and so far is

1088
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,863
Never speaking to them they know exactly what the left is going to do is truly amazing that if you never

1089
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
Ever learn anything

1090
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
About your political enemy

1091
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,031
You can say whatever it is you want them to

1092
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,895
These narratives established

1093
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Pretended they were ripe

1094
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,223
Regardless of how the jury decides

1095
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,367
React to the verdict being read actually determines which of these ideas

1096
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:19,487
Yeah if Chauvin is not guilty I will say the waters cause that to start the right

1097
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,535
If he is guilty that angle will be quickly

1098
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,351
Sister of the mob rule storyline

1099
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,399
This is an important to recognize

1100
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
Doesn't matter

1101
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Someone like Alex

1102
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
Just things that he incorporates like

1103
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
Props into the story

1104
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,919
Add a story with the Chauvin trial is that there's no outcome

1105
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
Actually good

1106
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
They're all just

1107
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
Useful

1108
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
Alex

1109
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
It is

1110
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
It's

1111
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
It's very annoying

1112
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
It's very annoying that they can just

1113
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,303
It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book based on the story

1114
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,143
You know like they've already got where they're going

1115
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,935
They just have to give you the difference

1116
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
It's like pathways

1117
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,775
To go down

1118
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,591
Then you have to start over

1119
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:10,175
Okay well now they're going to start a race war

1120
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
Next time

1121
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,087
But this time it was a Maxine Waters it's it's basically like

1122
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,927
Consistently saying both A and B

1123
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,767
Which are contradictory

1124
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,631
Talking so much about

1125
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
Yeah yeah yeah

1126
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,751
A squared plus b squared equals

1127
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,287
Either A or B

1128
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Barnes

1129
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,479
He has some comments that he wants to make but how Society got to the point that it is

1130
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
No although Alex

1131
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Should probably be mad at him

1132
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
What did we do

1133
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,975
Colletti's wanted to

1134
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,023
How do we counter people like this

1135
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
From culture

1136
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
Better

1137
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,847
Kindergarten Elementary School

1138
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Securus

1139
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,343
False

1140
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,119
He was saying it's a satanic

1141
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,447
So Robert barnes's

1142
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
Main contention

1143
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Is that

1144
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:44,895
Conservative right-wing outraged imaginary problem let us into a circle

1145
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
Stance

1146
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
That is

1147
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,295
Almost entirely conservative outrage at a made-up problem

1148
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Yeah or less

1149
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,903
That does make sense

1150
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,767
Should be mad about this is it Robert Barnes

1151
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,887
School try on

1152
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,703
P******

1153
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
He believes the Ted Gunderson is the most viable Source ever

1154
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,271
I wonder if Barnes was stopping himself

1155
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,551
Because you can hear him say

1156
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:29,183
You stopped him so I didn't want to be too specific

1157
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,975
Like

1158
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,791
Pissing off Alex there's a rule of life

1159
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
Don't don't

1160
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,631
Tread too closely into Alex's

1161
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Zones

1162
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,679
You know especially not with

1163
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Specifics

1164
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,239
Especially

1165
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
You can't

1166
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:49,407
I would like to Bear the indignity of agreeing with Alex's stupid

1167
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Book

1168
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
Noted

1169
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
Strokes gilo

1170
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,375
There is also gambling on the side

1171
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,983
You know how what you want you want from your lawyer is also gambling

1172
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,591
To Barnes Barnes is a kind of guy who's going to make a definite

1173
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,711
What's going to happen with this

1174
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
50% chance

1175
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
The trial

1176
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
People

1177
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
We're the Bad Guys

1178
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
That would make me

1179
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
You know

1180
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,943
Sedgwick

1181
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Tiana jewelry

1182
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:08,255
The main thing that protects us from a mob rule system where he

1183
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,815
Centering the actual Justice he would

1184
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:16,447
Take somebody anybody comment in the media

1185
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,847
Call decision to exist entirely within Oppositional Defiant Oppositional Defiant his decision-making

1186
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:29,247
The facts of the case the only thing

1187
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:37,183
Maxine Waters

1188
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,975
Jimmy Kimmel

1189
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Also

1190
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
Congratulations bars that are 50/50.

1191
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,495
There's a third possibility wishy-washy nonsense

1192
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,031
I found this

1193
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Very busy

1194
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,103
Zarbon all that bizarre

1195
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
This phenomenon going on where

1196
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:04,319
You had these two possibilities and these narratives that were built up towards the end

1197
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
The show

1198
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Where you have

1199
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
You know Maxine Waters is trying

1200
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,231
Cause a mistrial in order to

1201
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
Kid Rock eraser

1202
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,583
Haven't

1203
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,423
To create mob rule in order for the

1204
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,751
The jury to be cowed into guilty

1205
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,311
These things are kind of

1206
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
You know it's tough

1207
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
You have to disconnect

1208
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,455
Right and what I thought was really interesting as in this

1209
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
Next clip you can come

1210
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
Cialix tie them together

1211
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
Yeah alright

1212
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,671
Believe

1213
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,719
Acquit or disorder order they Bow Down

1214
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,007
So now what Alex has done is he's taking these two things he's

1215
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,823
Together under a similar umbrella

1216
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,615
Feel like they're connected

1217
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:06,271
Alex has decided that the deciding factor in this case is whether or not these three have been successful

1218
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:17,791
To the case or even the possibility that any of the jurors could find Chauvin guilty unless they were doing

1219
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Such thing as the merits of

1220
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
The case

1221
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,399
Conversation this way

1222
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,471
Conclusion isn't the right verdict of acquittal that's just a suit

1223
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,799
A guilty verdict is that the jury was afraid of

1224
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Because nonsense

1225
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
I said this makes Alex's narrative

1226
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
Feel like they're connect

1227
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,479
But they're actually not if you take a closer look

1228
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:42,879
This new cleaner framing leaves out the entire thing about Maxine Waters specifically making the comments you did

1229
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
In order to cause a mistrial so there would be right

1230
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:50,303
Backfiring and

1231
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:56,703
What are the differences between a really major to you would think

1232
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
Because it's

1233
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,799
Part of the globalist overarching

1234
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:05,407
Plan right that's the problem here why are we adding this element

1235
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
That destroys

1236
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
The plan that was already working

1237
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,415
In the conception of how Alex was talking about the verdict earlier in the episode it was pretty clear that the globalist want

1238
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,975
Because their goal was to incite

1239
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
With a guilty verdict

1240
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
That is

1241
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:28,191
Case the need to be so over-the-top

1242
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,495
Did a mistrial is guaranteed in the

1243
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,543
However in the new framing

1244
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
It appears the Globus actually want to be found

1245
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Guilty

1246
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Lamar Brewer

1247
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
These threats are either successful in which case

1248
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
The verdict is guilty

1249
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:46,367
Or they backfire in the service

1250
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,391
Achieving

1251
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
A guilty verdict

1252
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
If you pay close

1253
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Close attention

1254
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,791
Over the course of one show Alex is completely changed

1255
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,607
The primary motivation of his imaginary villain

1256
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,167
Because he's just making this up as he goes along

1257
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
None of this means anything

1258
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
This whole

1259
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
Like this whole thing

1260
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,847
Is basically just a lazy idiot engaging in an active really long

1261
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,663
Respected improvisational storytelling

1262
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,599
So that was the tale I think of

1263
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
Of the 20th

1264
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,159
I am in the evening

1265
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
Afternoon

1266
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,535
Pentagon time zone

1267
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
What you going to do

1268
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Chauvin guilty

1269
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Yes

1270
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
Also Ted Nugent

1271
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Got covid

1272
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,287
Other news

1273
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,615
You should go he doesn't he's got

1274
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,919
He's got to go on with covid that's got a half

1275
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:47,039
Absolutely find a way to be like this is

1276
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:52,671
Coming on the 21st now ask her

1277
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:53,951
The verdict

1278
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
Has happened

1279
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,767
You can tell a little bit of a

1280
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,607
Studio

1281
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:19,807
5 Wednesday

1282
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:25,695
What's a Lana Del Rey

1283
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,047
We watched him murder somebody

1284
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
It's not an attack on whiteness

1285
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:37,727
It's not an attack

1286
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:45,151
There's so many reasons to attack whiteness we didn't need this one you know how you were saying

1287
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
I did

1288
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
So you were before the bath

1289
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Because of this

1290
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,623
Quote unquote

1291
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
So you had to listen to Lana Del Rey

1292
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
He loves this album

1293
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Man I tell you what

1294
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:11,775
Free Christian album

1295
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
Christian

1296
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Sure

1297
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,967
Avant-garde The Cutting Edge

1298
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,599
I'm guessing that Alex just saw the one of the titles of the songs on Lana's new album

1299
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,999
Tulsa Jesus Freak

1300
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:38,911
Who's Alex forgotten that just three years ago he was spending quite a bit of time I show yelling about how Glenville Ray was a

1301
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,495
Evil spirit spells against Donald Trump because she said in an interview that

1302
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,055
Used witchcraft against Trump

1303
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:50,431
Delena remember her the entire right-wing was up in arms about her breakthrough out being called Born to Die

1304
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,967
That was

1305
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,319
The other outrage machine time that was back then when the outrage

1306
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:01,439
Machine was cranking out that b******* it's just it's so interesting I feel worried for him

1307
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,487
When he's playing about to land.

1308
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,559
I don't appreciate

1309
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,887
But it's okay for him to love Lana Del Rey publicly

1310
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
Star Wars

1311
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,007
Yeah he still feels the need to be like

1312
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Sublease

1313
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:26,783
Exactly someone you would only know only exist in the books

1314
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,391
Something it would be impossible to be immediately.

1315
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,023
Because Star Wars

1316
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,143
So in Christianity

1317
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:51,359
Yeah I guess that means Christianity is having a great time

1318
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,895
Satan is real

1319
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
Okay

1320
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
You are

1321
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,759
And this is not a simulation

1322
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,599
That sounds like something a simulation but right

1323
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,391
Consciousness

1324
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,023
Exactly like what somebody the tribulation for today

1325
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,095
The universe the seed of

1326
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,423
It's not just giving away

1327
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Pretty lady

1328
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
You must

1329
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
Detested

1330
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
We tested

1331
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,015
Maxine Waters in the front

1332
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
What

1333
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,367
And the Rockefellers in the Bill Gates

1334
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
The world

1335
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
These are people

1336
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,743
Failed the test

1337
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,327
These are people

1338
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,143
Held in Mindless clown like

1339
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Bondage

1340
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:53,311
Mostly keep that clipping for the turn of phrase to sound like

1341
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,871
I like bondage is not bad

1342
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
I mean it's just

1343
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:13,791
Spiritual does seem like we're going to get esoteric Christianity

1344
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,935
Deal with the coverings

1345
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:23,519
There's a lot of racist to cover that

1346
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,127
Probably just talk about

1347
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
We are in the process of

1348
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
I'm not human extermination

1349
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,295
The slow destruction

1350
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
All carbon-based life

1351
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
Forms on

1352
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,183
Is the goal of Satan

1353
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
Does that matter though

1354
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Animated

1355
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,351
Image of God

1356
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
And Satan

1357
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,239
Rc-20

1358
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
Why

1359
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Humans are

1360
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
We are beautiful

1361
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,919
We can experience

1362
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
The universe

1363
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Communion

1364
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
The Creator

1365
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Poems

1366
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
The eye of God

1367
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
Gods

1368
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
Castle

1369
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,071
We seattlr

1370
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
Todd system

1371
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,167
Experience

1372
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
I don't want to be any

1373
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,519
Nothing Satan do

1374
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Never changed

1375
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
What

1376
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:33,151
I don't know I feel like maybe he should have gone to college

1377
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:37,759
Jim got high maybe we'll work some of this out of his system

1378
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
You know Kevin like you know you're annoying conversation

1379
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
1 this life

1380
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Yeah

1381
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,023
Hit it again

1382
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,263
This is a test and that's all it is

1383
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
Because

1384
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,103
God is testing you to see if you can come

1385
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
And hang out with him

1386
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
I guess

1387
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,199
Is the person

1388
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
Entity

1389
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Doing the

1390
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
The testing

1391
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
That's he is part of God's

1392
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
Planned

1393
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,415
If you're like Pelosi or Prince Philip you have failed

1394
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
Potassium

1395
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:25,631
He's been doing this for thousands of years

1396
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:32,799
You know the devil is like I'm already part of the plan and gods like he's not going to succeed in destroying all of the people

1397
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:39,199
We've got Alex fight well because the last 999 years is 1000 year plan

1398
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,503
Leading up to this

1399
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,807
Well that's why God gave us

1400
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
Sort of

1401
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,135
Biasly people have about like

1402
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,439
The immediacy order currency like

1403
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
The time

1404
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,023
I'm tired

1405
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
Every generation of the last generation

1406
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,119
Exactly

1407
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,191
Obviously there's reasons to feel that way sometimes

1408
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,823
From that in a way.

1409
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,871
Travis Scott

1410
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Sounds like that

1411
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,271
Like maybe

1412
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,551
I started to like

1413
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
I don't know

1414
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:22,463
Explorer Elementary

1415
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:30,399
Yeah when you should have that, your head is empty your big dumb dumb you should be smoking weed and having dumb conversation

1416
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,959
The same time when you're not smoking weed

1417
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,751
You should be reading books

1418
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,079
Struggling with reading comprehension

1419
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:41,663
And then you won't have to have those conversations ever again

1420
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,223
I love and never having those conversations damn

1421
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,063
What is really bizarre

1422
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,135
Immediately after this

1423
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
Conversation about

1424
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,999
Elements of God's eye

1425
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
Experiencing things

1426
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
For God

1427
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351
Also tentacles

1428
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Cone

1429
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
In the eye of God

1430
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
We are

1431
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
Gods

1432
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
Castle

1433
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,247
God's tentacles

1434
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
Todd system

1435
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,599
Experience

1436
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
Nothing statement

1437
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,231
Will ever change that

1438
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,583
So don't let the enemy get you down

1439
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,887
How do I get to Baytown

1440
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
It's sad

1441
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,519
Religion of race war

1442
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
Worshipping

1443
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
On the surface

1444
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
Really felt weird

1445
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Did you want to do

1446
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,903
I don't

1447
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:02,303
Feel comfortable now that makes me feel very uncomfortable that's really gross because now you're

1448
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,351
Transforming the

1449
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,239
Even the slightest modicum of racial Justice

1450
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Into a holy war

1451
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:16,384
Against anyone who would try and get a modicum of

1452
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,760
Also the pronouns that are used for a little bit

1453
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:25,088
Strange Music

1454
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,392
Eyes of God and whatever

1455
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Them

1456
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:34,816
But he does seem like what he was doing

1457
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:40,448
Very different view of people based upon their skin

1458
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,008
That's just me I could be wrong tell you what

1459
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,616
Is very strange very weird

1460
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:54,784
Is a very easy explanation

1461
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,808
Just talking to white people

1462
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,672
Dammit

1463
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,792
He thinks he's talking to a diverse audience

1464
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
That's weird

1465
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
That doesn't matter

1466
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,192
That's not cool

1467
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:17,824
Anyway what I'm saying is that we

1468
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,760
Alex's buddy Gary Allan

1469
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
You know

1470
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:32,160
I always like to find these kinds of moments where there's all its branches

1471
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,744
What is the possibility for Alex and I too agree

1472
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
Delegation is always even if it's superficial

1473
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:44,192
I kind of thought that maybe Nancy Pelosi is very

1474
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Unfortunate

1475
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
Poorly

1476
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:52,896
Really putting your name at the top of the list

1477
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,224
Yourselves out and

1478
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,248
Referred to

1479
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,784
George Floyd's murder as

1480
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
Sacrifice for justice

1481
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
What are those

1482
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
Realshit

1483
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:10,048
I thought that maybe there would be an opportunity for Alex and I to come to some sort of an agreement

1484
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Yeah it seems like it wouldn't be hard

1485
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,216
That's the level of s*** that if I was Nancy Pelosi's a Dye wood

1486
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
Immediately

1487
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:24,384
Play tackle her off the stage if everybody will like you more if you get hurt for this

1488
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,272
Excuse of like ice

1489
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,576
Unfortunately

1490
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,112
Layout for Alex

1491
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,648
To get me to agree with him

1492
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,440
But somehow

1493
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,536
Only miss the shot he broke his ankle

1494
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,072
Critical failure

1495
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,912
She said yesterday

1496
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,472
Breathing through her face diaper

1497
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
Life

1498
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
Terramaster

1499
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,160
Baby fake George Floyd for his

1500
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,720
Sacrifice like he was a veteran

1501
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,024
Jesus on the cross

1502
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
Drugged out

1503
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
Male prostitute

01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
Until the moment he died

1507
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
Just missed

1508
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
Wow

1509
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,272
Staffmark

1510
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,552
Incredible

1511
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,368
Justin credible something so

1512
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,416
So easy he's too racist

1513
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,976
To even criticize Nancy Pelosi when she

1514
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
Wow

1515
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,144
Level I just didn't expect

1516
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,680
I just didn't expect

1517
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
Withers disappointment

1518
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,312
And then there's this point

1519
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
You can't even clear that

1520
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,480
Critiquing Nancy Pelosi

1521
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,112
Yeah that kind of bumble dare she not be racist enough for me

1522
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,928
That's that's not good

1523
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
So the feds

1524
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,840
Which means actually the UN is in charge and we have no cover

1525
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,608
Okay

1526
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,800

Policies

1530

Military

1531
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
We are now

1532
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,368
Concord Nation

1533
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
I didn't really realize we're Concord

1534
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,512
Unified against their evil week

1535
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
Usually take government

1536
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,656
This is just about the Department of Justice opening an inquiry into the Minneapolis Police Department

1537
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:00,032
Sister dramatic little baby into the UN running the country

1538
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,336
Bodies

1539
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
Yeah

1540
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:08,736
Diculous escalate things a lot quicker whenever your big bad is the devil

1541
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,040
You know you can't be like this is just going to

1542
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:16,928
He couldn't even possibly like they're just going to root out the Patriots in the in the police state

1543
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,488
That's why it's bad it has to be a

1544
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,048
Fleet overthrow of the United States

1545
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
Sure

1546
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,680
I don't I don't know if you're aware of this

1547
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,960
But we live in a Multiverse

1548
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:34,336
Do you know that we live in those universes simultaneously

1549
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,616
30 Head East

1550
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
Not just live in one dimension

1551
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:45,856
I want open the phone number to the barber the next our constitutional lawyer joint is going bad

1552
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,440
I'd like to shift the dimensions do that

1553
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,792
How do I live in the dimension where Norm pattis isn't coming back on the show

1554
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,864
What's up what's

1555
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,424
The quantum suicide

1556
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,056
Can you just call suicide at Universal

1557
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
F****** building Asia

1558
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,896
Ridiculous

1559
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
Pour milk

1560
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Do it

1561
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,320
So I wouldn't tell you

1562
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Not a good

1563
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,232
If you're saying that now after where we've come

1564
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
Well

1565
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,072
This has to do with lead in

1566
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,352
To conversation

1567
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:33,472
Conversation about the shooting

1568
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,008
Sure sure

1569
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
Good

1570
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,736
Islam black young people

1571
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,648
But they're highly impressionable and what you should do

1572
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:00,864
I just saw video this morning

1573
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,888
Columbus Ohio

1574
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,728
Little black babies

1575
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
Looks like she has a McDonald's cheeseburger

1576
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,616
How far

1577
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
Where are you

1578
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,944
Woman and a black woman

1579
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
With a

1580
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
People call the police

1581
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,952
She did keep stabbing people

1582
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,144
And because the white

1583
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Devil

1584
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
Shop the Black Angel

1585
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,776
Black lives matter protesting and rioting

1586
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,360
There's a lot of details to be sorted out about the shooting

1587
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,944
Assess the situation

1588
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,480
I'm going to leave that to

1589
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,016
More information to come out

1590
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,552
Time to process and what-have-you

1591
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:55,904
I wanted to play this clip however to demonstrate how opening for Alex

1592
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,232
Begin by discussing how

1593
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,328
Reasonable black youth being taught to attack

1594
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:07,936
Actual details of this case are secondary and not nearly as important

1595
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,728
So explicitly racist

1596
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
His show are this is

1597
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,800
That's outrageous.

1598
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,080
That is so fat

1599
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,944
I just don't know how you for very impression how can

1600
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,504
Can I don't I will never understand

1601
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
Quite how

1602
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Easy it is

1603
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Is 4

1604
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
White race

1605
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Get to like

1606
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,648
Well

1607
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,952
If you're 15 in Black though you're big

1608
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Right here bigger

1609
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
Then

1610
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
15 year old white people

1611
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
Also whatever happens

1612
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,096
I just

1613
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
How

1614
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
How do you get

1615
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
There

1616
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Like

1617
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
It's just unconscionable

1618
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
I don't disagree

1619
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,872
Like for all they're screaming about pedophilia its

1620
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Kill Dobby

1621
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
Because they're black

1622
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
And that means there

1623
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
Or whatever

1624
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,784
Unreal it's

1625
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,368
It's pretty breathtaking

1626
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
This Racist

1627
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,928
To not be

1628
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Like

1629
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
It's amazing that it exists

1630
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
Yeah it's a really it's shocking

1631
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Did it exist

1632
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,096
Stem isn't dealt with

1633
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,632
The proper

1634
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
Contact number

1635
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,960
It's not related to as like

1636
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:23,200
Printed sometimes it's a clam show sometimes they talk about other things

1637
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:29,856
Maybe the clan had to talk about like anniversaries in like we have a new kid

1638
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
This is so pretty

1639
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,744
Pretty out in the open

1640
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,536
That's unreal

1641
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,840
That's just unreal

1642
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
Alec

1643
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:46,752
Completely different idea he thinks the show is like full of sophisticated information

1644
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,800
I've always believed in

1645
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,616
That's why I said

1646
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,152
Populist program

1647
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
Put out

1648
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,224
Very sophisticated information

1649
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
All so simple truth the same time

1650
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
Believing that

1651
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
The level of information that

1652
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,392
Understand

1653
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,184
Not done the information now

1654
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
Wow

1655
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,864
Government Style

1656
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
PowerPoint

1657
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,192
Just go over.

1658
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,800
That is extremely effective not just like General Flynn

1659
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
I can tell you

1660
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,128
Bannister's world leaders

1661
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
2025 20

1662
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
It was done in a briefing

1663
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,648
Not a f******

1664
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:41,280
I feel like this is a simulation because there's no way a human being could possibly be that unself-aware

1665
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,656
Images

1666
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:50,752
You can't possibly f****** believe that anybody took that chick Siri High

1667
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:54,336
Sparse video that he did was so f***

1668
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,128
Offensively clunky

1669
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,712
Who's so dumb that Michael guy with a total weirdo

1670
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
Taken line

1671
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Completely out of context making

1672
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,088
Completely false assertions about the document

1673
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,136
Anybody who actually read it

1674
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,416
Like without

1675
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,000
Already pre deciding that Alex was right

1676
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
Oh my God

1677
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Not a f******

1678
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,544
Here's the thing that I have to like the idea

1679
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,104
But he has another speed

1680
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,920
Right I do like that idea because I think it's

1681
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:34,016
Funny when he does that

1682
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,416
You don't have that picture anymore

1683
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,952
Maybe never did

1684
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,512
But he was certainly better at looking like he did

1685
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,304
Earlier

1686
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,144
I like that because I would like for him to take this way more seriously

1687
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,680
Cuz I will too

1688
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,520
I-don't-want-to-talk-about-it

1689
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:01,920
Conceptions of the devil give a s*** you don't even know how fast your fast

1690
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,016
You been hanging around 75 like

1691
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:09,600
Sooner or later he's going to get better at batting

1692
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:17,792
It's just it's frustrating and I would like

1693
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,864
That's it that's kind of interesting though because

1694
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,216
Once you find out like the FBI was listening to Joe Biggs I'd like

1695
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,008
Antifa protests

1696
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,824
You realize like all these people are morons

1697
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,408
That the CIA had meetings on it because

1698
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,480
I don't know if I trust any of them to do a fundamental Google search

1699
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,808
At this point we're all insane

1700
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:43,392
If I worked in the CIA I might want to have a meeting on it

1701
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:50,048
Pizza

1702
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,656
We're going to put it on the big screen

1703
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,264
It's time for the big enchilada

1704
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,080
Let me hear phone calls

1705
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,944
Public with their money

1706
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
The medical system

1707
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
The media system

1708
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,648
World Council of churches on with all the churches are just

1709
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
Country Club field groups

1710
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
Spotify

1711
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,024
It doesn't matter

1712
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,840
Hollywood

1713
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,424
Orthodox Islam

1714
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,472
Israel

1715
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
South Africa they got everybody

1716
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,360
Wow one thing you don't have

1717
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
You

1718
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
U.s. military

1719
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Stop going on

1720
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,648
It's got its own problems

1721
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,184
Getting a divorce

1722
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
Chivalry

1723
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,816
Chopper

1724
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,936
Cars race riot

1725
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,240
Military police

1726
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,800
Get control of them

1727
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:12,736
Not this makes sense why would they have

1728
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
You don't need to take over the police

1729
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
Also if Alex is

1730
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:19,136
They don't have Russia

1731
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:26,816
What know what they got everything. Everything got everything is the 2nd of the police

1732
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,376
The fact that you're putting those two together

1733
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,776
Kind of makes you realize what the police is don't you like this is ridiculous

1734
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:40,640
Like even taking the serious way

1735
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:44,480
There's still plenty of white nationalists in the US military in the police

1736
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:49,856
Stillwater heavily-armed whereabouts

1737
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:50,880
So

1738
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
We got that

1739
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,464
Yeah I don't know this just it feels like

1740
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,280
It just felt like that was what was going to like

1741
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:00,352
Work for him to say

1742
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,912
Match with any of the stuff he says

1743
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
It doesn't make sense

1744
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,872
I feel like if you were somebody who

1745
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,408
The police in the military

1746
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
You're a fast

1747
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,712
That's what I would

1748
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
This is just

1749
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Splake

1750
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,808
Improvisational storytelling

1751
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
In storytelling

1752
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
Sometimes

1753
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,280
The hero is doing well

1754
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
Sometimes girls doing

1755
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,864
When Heroes down

1756
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,472
You had a tear for them to come back out

1757
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
Or whatever it is

1758
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,080
I think it was a couple weeks ago

1759
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,128
Usher

1760
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,176
Georgia

1761
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:50,016
They are now losing

1762
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:53,600
I'm not like the Q people tell you everything's fine we've won the war

1763
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
We're losing

1764
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
Everything's collapsing

1765
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,768
And we have no future

1766
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,080
Launch accelerator timetables

1767
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,384
Was Jeffrey me Reckless they were 10 years behind

1768
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,480
Hear this over and over and over again

1769
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
He's got to get a new bit

1770
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
Like is this B is

1771
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,576
Tired

1772
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,136
I just

1773
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,928
Feel like I can handle this

1774
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,232
Infinite battle between Alex

1775
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:37,632
And his evil enemies right and everybody is either accelerating or decelerating

1776
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:44,032
On his mood is putting their chips on the table

1777
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:49,920
If it doesn't work this time I guess they've been defeated

1778
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,248
I don't know

1779
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
This Mexico

1780
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,624
Yeah I would say

1781
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,000
Get Alex institutionalized

1782
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,816
There's a lot of things that he says that are like

1783
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,096
Offensive

1784
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
Really offend

1785
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:14,496
Shunned

1786
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Yeah

1787
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,032
This

1788
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
If she really believe this

1789
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,640
You should be putting

1790
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,664
The padded cell

1791
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
From them on I am here

1792
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:36,768
Vision of the enemy

1793
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,840
Alex is taking on the sins of humanity

1794
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,888
So he can see the globalist

1795
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,704
Playing like a crook like you've taken on the role of Jesus

1796
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,752
Frederick

1797
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:48,288
The globalist

1798
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,312
Is not

1799
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,592
Blessed Alex

1800
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,360
Is

1801
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,688
Very close to declaring himself the new Messiah

1802
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,760
Because he was

1803
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,344
Getting more and more comfortable with talking about himself as a prophet

1804
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:07,488
Over the last six months or so at all

1805
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:16,960
I must make myself of the Christ so long before you want that next

1806
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
Okay

1807
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,576
Go to called

1808
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Decades

1809
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,024
Two volatile and paranoid

1810
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,376
Pedophile

1811
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:49,728
Call slaves and China's evil and

1812
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,800
Everything is propaganda against the white man and

1813
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,616
And they're right.

1814
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,152
And everybody was

1815
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Just tell me I was

1816
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:03,040
Freedom and guns and private property as the white man

1817
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,832
Communism is the black man

1818
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,880
Good

1819
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
Call Brandon

1820
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
Even in commercials

1821
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:28,384
Like abusing my men and women hitting them and just it is just always just trigger

1822
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,016
Several years ago I hurt you for the fur

1823
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
First time

1824
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,624
And I realize I'm not the only person that sees that you know I thought I was like

1825
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:47,072
The bumbling husband probably dates back a little further than married

1826
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:47,840
I guess

1827
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:53,728
It's better than if they were like I think we should go back to The Honeymooners when it was

1828
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,496
Your wife

1829
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:57,568
The character trip with a dumb husband

1830
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,920
He's going to really hate when he learns about all the other historical characters of people who

1831
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,944
Call boy

1832
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:08,064
Little bit

1833
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,112
Fathers are kind of idiots is because

1834
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,416
Easiest way to make

1835
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
And flexible enough to

1836
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
To fit into the comedic

1837
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,024
Premises that are required for a sitcom to work

1838
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,376
Most of the situation of the characters get into probably wouldn't happen or if they

1839
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,448
Did they would be resolved in way less comical ways

1840
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,008
If one of the characters in charge wasn't a goof

1841
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,080
You could make every show like Father Knows Best

1842
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,616
But guess what Father Knows Best

1843
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,152
Suck

1844
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
Show

1845
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:41,344
But you know what I also hate the depiction of white people in films

1846
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,928
Being stupid which is why I hate Breakfast at Tiffany's

1847
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,792
Do you know what I hate about Breakfast at Tiffany's

1848
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:53,120
Who is definitely meant to read his wife 100%

1849
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Yeah this is

1850
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,936
This is not to

1851
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,544
What does make sense this guy would have these

1852
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,568
Clearly

1853
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,128
Racist feelings towards media

1854
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,456
And everything that you eat

1855
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:10,784
And then he said he's like I found my people

1856
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:11,808
Of course

1857
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
No s***

1858
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,232
How old

1859
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:22,816
All white people have had it

1860
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
F****** p****

1861
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,608
Aesthetically

1862
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
Easy for so goddamn long

1863
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,984
The idea of one

1864
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,080
Appearance in movies or film the white guy is the bad guys like

1865
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
How could anybody do that

1866
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,296
Alex would beg to differ based on his own

1867
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
Millions and millions of dollars

1868
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Any black people

1869
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,328
75 times by white people

1870
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,712
Hospitalized

1871
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,600
I love those folks I love the ones

1872
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,368

Do you remember when you whistle did I appreciate that was great

1876
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:32,448
They gave it all that's what they should do if he gets done too much of a race is red

1877
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:36,032
They should just start playing

1878
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,824
I'm in your blackberry

1879
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:42,688
To get like one of those intermission

1880
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:49,088
Images and it's no it's photoshopped Alex's face

1881
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:54,720
Holding hands with young Richie Cunningham

1882
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Opie carrying carrying a fishing pole piece of s***

1883
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:08,032
Hey I'm a huge racist but also I'm going to brag about how

1884
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,056
Good I am

1885
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,664
Batman fights and put them in comas

1886
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,688
Sure

1887
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,968
Very strange what up

1888
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,992
F***** up dude

1889
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,064
I'm just saying I wouldn't be who I was

1890
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,648
If I would put in the hospital and broken legs and broken arms and

1891
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,976
Subdural hematomas

1892
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,304
I really want to fight

1893
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,376
I'm not going to pretend to not understand the point Alex's

1894
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
Just trying to make your portal

1895
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,984
Being like battle-hardened

1896
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,336
Thankful for the struggles that he went through the movie is today

1897
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,712
There's a fine version of it

1898
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,136
Black people

1899
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,440
Specific people he got in fights

1900
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,512
I was generalizing to the larger black population

1901
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,560
Here in a way that is incredibly

1902
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:07,168
Listening to this I'm not actually even sure if Alex realizes he's doing what he's doing

1903
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
It is embarrassing

1904
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,752
Yeah that's

1905
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:13,056
This is been a real sucker

1906
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
Can highlight reel

1907
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:18,944
This is this it's nothing really

1908
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
Good

1909
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
No

1910
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:21,760
No

1911
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,552
I would say that you

1912
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576

01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,976
Feel like I can't be too far off

1915
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,560
If you can try and justify as racism

1916
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,328
You're not

1917
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,864
It's too late for that

1918
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,400

1931
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,816
What they're doing is there

1932
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
People from

1933
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Culebra

1934
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,288
What does it mean

1935
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,568

Think it made sense

1947
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
Based on real-life conditions

1948
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,088
No

1949
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880

Focusing too much on

1956
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,776

In order to move forward we have

1963
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
To get rid of

1964
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,928
We got to not do this anymore

1965
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,256
