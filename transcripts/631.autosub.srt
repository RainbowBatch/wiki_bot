Song covers it livable in the apartment but yeah it was

15

It was brutal

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Maybe it's just like

17
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
Particularly drafty today

18
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Am I in my old apartment I absolutely left it for two days before I even called the landlord

19
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464

While I was here the office but yeah

00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
It was. I should have called quicker

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
But like they responded really

24
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Stop my landlords

25
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664

That's amazing so that was that was pretty impressive

27
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
And now it's

00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Warm enough that I have to have oscillating fan Don to have a little breeze

29
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Back home

30
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
That was a bad is heroin a trip that I think I've ever taken I got a few texts

31
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
About this

32
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
You have to have a negative test within 24 hours of leaving and you know that when you're

33
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
They're you know that when you're there I don't know if I'm going to make it back on

34
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,184
But when you're get that test in that 15 minutes before you know what's happening

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
You suddenly realize the gravity of the actual

36
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,984
It's several thousand dollars and God knows what else he liked all of your plan

37
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032

It's never thought I would do that before my life you've discussed it with a whole fish

44
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384

Similar

94
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
I always enjoyed Mike's May quite a bit though he is the first season of never not funny

Pretty funny dude many people is called in the Mark Twain in Chicago

99
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
I wouldn't do that

100
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
Here is where we start off Jordan

101
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791

102
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Got my ears okay

103
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Today

104
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Apologize

105
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Was legitimately having

106
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Because I'm a real person

107
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
Learn self-control I've gotten better about it over the years

108
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
I am so upset

109
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
With Trump

110
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
And the Betrayal

111
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
That adjust

112
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
Just makes the top of my head blow off I get so angry

113
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Best okay so it's

114
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
Pretty rare that we get to start the show with him

115
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
Apologizing to the crew for the day before

116
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,543
Book the 21st I'm going back to the 20th obviously there were fireworks

117
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,687
Anything following the I apologize to the girl at the beginning of her show is f*** off that means

118
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Disaster

119
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Yeah

120
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
So we start off on the 20th and here is how the show open

121
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Where are the others

122
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
In the Democratic Party

123
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
This is a

124
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
A break is a special report the John bowne

125
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Send

126
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
The smash-and-grab

127
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Epidemic

128
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Popularized

129
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Buy black live

130
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
By the Democratic

131
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Party

132
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
According to witness

133
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
Shortly

134
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
For the Barton Creek

135
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Square mall closed

136
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
During the biggest shopping weekend

137
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
For Christmas

138
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
Broke into the display

139
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:46,239
This is just like a flagrantly racist way to cover a story like this

140
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
The game of their trying to play is just there was a looting in the aftermath

141
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
George Floyd killer

142
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
Black lives matter logo

143
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
He stops all robbery

144
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Who's really transparent

145
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Just the work of

146
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Cretin bigots

147
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
This kind of crime happens a lot

148
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,975
Because as it might be super obvious if you think about it for one second jewelry stores or places

149
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Massive amounts

150
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Highly valuable items

151
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
And if their security isn't very good they make for

152
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,679
Compelling soft targets

153
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Cmovies

154
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Contacts

155
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Going to data compiled by the Jewelers

156
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Security Alliance

157
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
There were 200

158
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,663
26 Smash and grab robberies of jewelry stores in 2019 and 20

159
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
20

160
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
The total number of on-premise

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Burglaries during that time frame was

162
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
Jewelry stores get robbed a lot

163
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
That's why a lot of them have bulletproof glass bars on the window and remote

164
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,327
Door locks of people like you could only enter if the person buzzes you him right right right

165
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,167
You can find from the jeweler's Alliance report is that Texas is the state

166
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Pretty consistently tops

167
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
What's the most active States for jewelry store robbery

168
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
In 2020 19.8% of the total robberies were in Texas

169
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
With California being the next highest state with 8.7

170
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
God damn so pretty pretty high above that is like an exemplary

171
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
Version of like a man that never ended in Texas it's over double cab

172
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,631
Yeah you said you started robbing people in the 1700's with stagecoaches and it just never stop

173
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,751
Also as you might expect jewelry stores in malls had the highest incidence of Smash

174
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Grab

175
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,151
Which makes sense because the robber would have reason to think they could Escape into the crowd and more easily get away

176
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,039
There was a jewelry store robbery at the mall near Alex's house and now one of his subordinates is

177
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Was making a really racist video about it

178
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,183
Complying with these robberies are happening at a different rate than they always do

179
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
It's the fault of Democrats are black lives matter

180
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Food place. And I wouldn't be too surprised if this isn't an attempt to get another panic going like they did with the knockout game

181
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
A few years back

182
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
To be clear it sucks

183
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
The crime is happening but expect me to believe it's the same as losing the brakes

184
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Political unrest

185
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
I can only assume that's not attempt to your argument this is just bullshiting

186
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Absolutely

187
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Nonsense

188
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
No I need

189
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,183
It's not hard to see all of this and then CV blowback coming from all the propaganda with

190
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
At endless

191
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Endless explainers on

192
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
The actual data like eyes are all f****** lying to cut crime is going down get the f*** out of here these people are like

193
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Tires trying to get money from you stealing

194
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Your money by telling you that other people are stealing their

195
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
I kind of was interested in this because

196
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
I don't know

197
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
Overly invested in the 20th because Alex apologize for it

198
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,439
Fine I'll listen to John balance report if you have to

199
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
This is just

200
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Bulova

201
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
This repeater Eyes by black lives matter like black lives matter was like Hey guys

202
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,447
Nobody's ever tried this ship before it's been in the shadows

203
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
It's time to really bring it to the Forefront of the tool

204
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Right it's it's like

205
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
Rainbow suspenders with the sky

206
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
Popularized

207
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Reporting going on in this

208
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Report

209
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Patrons

210
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Before the exit

211
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
Claims that a voice came over the loudspeaker

212
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Announcing that the doors have been locked

213
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
The innocent

214
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Trapped inside

215
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Desperate arms

216
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
In order to

217
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Prophets

218
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Of the blood

219
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Diamond industry

220
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Wait what

221
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Confusing

222
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,127
I can find no evidence of people were trapped inside by any locked doors and in fact

223
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
In every article that I can find about this robbery

224
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,551
Disgust me quick evacuation the First Responders did just in case there was any real Danger

225
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,951
There were some reports that people heard gunshots but their ultimate Lee was no evidence of any guns being used in the robbery

226
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
Are people most likely heard the breaking glass

227
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,095
From the Smashing at before the grabbing show

228
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,447
So there's no reason to assume that these innocent people were trapped in there was desperate arm Bluetooth

229
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Yeah that would be a crazy thing to immediately leave to

230
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Supervillain level s*** right there I love it

231
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
Okay I'm going back to the jeweler's Alliance report only about 35% of jewelry store robberies even involve a guy

232
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
If you're trying to be

233
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Quick and there's a high likelihood of you getting caught

234
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
That's the wrong

235
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Smash-and-grab and jewelry store robberies

236
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
Like if you get unlucky

237
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
You don't want to add a gun charge to whatever else you're going to be facing the most people probably wouldn't bring a gun to bad idea

238
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
A robbery like that

239
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
Yeah it's what burglary versus armed robbery is a difference of like 10-15 years and sentencing or whatever

240
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,647
Something crazy I mean yourself shot easily let's say

241
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
I'm confused

242
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Like we both were

243
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
The stick 12 the jewelry industry for selling Blood Diamond

244
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,447
Does he not know that the network is shows.on was heavily subsidized by a guy who owns a gold company

245
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Who did a lot of business with a guy was deep in apartheid gold

246
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:14,431
This is odd to be both like it's mrs. all entirely black

247
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,063
Lives matters fault obviously the profit-driven corporations and made all the decisions made

248
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Play the reason we're here in the first

249
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
What are you trying to say to me

250
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Very strange

251
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
It's weird to complain to the idea that corporate

252
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
Profits are being treated as a higher concern than human life when that's Infowars in

253
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Higher philosophy as its related to covid

254
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,727
Before they embarked on their vaccines are secretly killing everyone season

255
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,823
The earlier argument was that lockdowns attempt to severe and affect on the economy and

256
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
But some people

257
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Getting sick was a good price to pay to keep these Corporation

258
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
Yeah that oftentimes it was like listen there's a mortality rate under 4% or what

259
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
Whatever so we can just live through this let 4% of people die

260
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,719
I don't know this is an incoherent report that I'm listen

261
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
I was interested like

262
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
I gave it a shot but

263
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
John Brown can I keep my attention for more than a minute

264
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
Good morning ladies and gentlemen

265
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Alex Jones

266
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Will be here quick

267
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,695
Not interested just going to be there after the first hours

268
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
It's going to go bad

269
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,559
So I skipped ahead to the second hour and

270
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
What's going on

271
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
The Alex Jones Show

272
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Ikea

273
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
I truly incredible I have a hard enough time just putting on my show in the morning I was Johnson only does larger

274
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,927
Franklin

275
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,327
Is that all of this stuff and operate the store and deal with all of the attacks on him continuously

276
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Probably stressful and you can afford

277
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Him and all of us of course I going forward store.com take advantage of the Christmas supercell it continues their 60% off plus free

278
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Prepare to make good on your New Year's resolutions

279
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,807
Went smoothly from an apology that Alex isn't here yet

280
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Also Harrison

281
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Desperately

282
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Trying not to say that I was just talking to lawyer

283
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Oh yeah

284
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Absolutely

285
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
He's working on the

286
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Code for all of the lawsuits

287
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
Since the attacks

288
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Hey but it's just trying not to say like

289
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
She's trying to figure out a way that

290
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
He's not here today

291
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,879
From cigarette how to build a metaphorical life raft

292
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Epoch time

293
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,255
Because if he doesn't we won't be able to afford a literal life rap

294
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
I was Fury

295
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
I was promised

296
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Going to be here the 2nd.

297
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
I don't like

298
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
All right there's something you promises

299
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Again that Alex will be there

300
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:24,383
47 minutes into the second break of the hour Alex shows up

301
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:30,527
Well I really appreciate the great Aerosmith a normally host American Journal weekday mornings 8 a.m.

302
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
11 a.m.

303
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
For sitting in for me

304
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
In my office getting ready

305
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
For today transmission

306
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,071
So much work in front of me and in so many important things going on that I had to

307
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
But I just called

308
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
I just took a hundred yards away or so

309
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
I'm sad

310
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Ourselves

311
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Take care of this business

312
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
Normally my own private business would not be

313
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
And the list

314
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
To explain myself

315
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Where does country in the world

316
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
This morning I went ahead and made the decision

317
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Especially

318
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Wednesday

319
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
January 6th

320
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Witch Hunt

321
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
Will be filed against the committee

322
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Today

323
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
In Washington DC

324
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
Alex comes on air is

325
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,295
I'm fucken suing the government and that's what I was doing

326
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
So

327
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Maybe

328
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
Maybe a little bit of that

329
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
The

330
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
Pleading the fifth like I was obviously going to do tonight

331
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Pretty much said as much

332
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Repeatedly prior to this over and over and over again

333
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Consequence

334
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Is there written certainly no

335
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,079
Just love the image of how Infowars works

336
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Smith show

337
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,247
Is before Alex Adams and then Alex's show straight away

338
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
Pizza from his office

339
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Stay on air

340
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,951
It does have a little bit of an even more chaotic

341
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Shity

342
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
30 Rock Live to it

343
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
You just like you're peeking out of your cubicle and being I think you could pick me up

344
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,167
On your way back from the kitchen

345
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
My name's on that

346
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
I got a deal with

347
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
With all these lawsuits

348
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Can you cover my shift

349
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
So there's another reason Alex's light

350
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,111
It was 11:00 already told Harrison to to do that but then I was doing some more accounting

351
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
In the past I just hope the money comes into fun things

352
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
This random County

353
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
Because this is a place you built this is place you kept on Aaron

354
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
That I don't like coming on here

355
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Plugging medicine selling that

356
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Support

357
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Because

358
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
That's not the position I like the

359
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
But with the supply chain breakdowns inflation all the rest of

360
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Check

361
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Call Wars

362
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Will implode

363
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Within 36

364
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Not bringing enough

365
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
Money and because we have to have our own servers

366
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
Systems are on satellite uplinks our own

367
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
Proprietary systems that we have to go out and have people build in May

368
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Level

369
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Looks like

370
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,096
War bonds in the form of overpriced silver worth a good investment

371
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
Seemed to work out the way we had hope

372
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Snow

373
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,984
I'm also I'm not going to put too much

374
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Stock into this 326

375
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
Six months number as I've been

376
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
I've got my hopes up a number of times and Alex is like work or f***** we're going out of business

377
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
Money bomb episode in Year One

378
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
When he was like what's

379
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,416
It was different it was in the development of the like

380
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,072
We have a couple months left in the last year-and-a-half that's true

381
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
But

382
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Still it's just kind of the new desperate version of exactly what you

383
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Talk about the money bomb

384
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
We need to do a 37-hour marathon for freedom of speech

385
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
We just got to get rid of all of this product and if you don't get it soon I'm not saying we're going out of business I'm just saying that the

386
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
Finish Line is in sight

387
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
Need to sell this s***

388
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
So you got you got this

389
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
What's going on

390
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Bright

391
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Kicked off social media

392
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
It's not about the people have been kicked off social media platforms

393
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
Alex believe that there's another layer of censorship

394
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
It's coming and that is

395
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Apparently blocking URL

396
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
Something that is done too like infowars.com here

397
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
In the near future and then he predicts a false flag

398
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
And I intend to fight as hard as I can

399
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
And working with others to build

400
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Structure

401
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
Next level deplatforming

402
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Urls

403
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,592
Delisting of URLs that's going to happen right before the midterm

404
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Guaranteed they're going to do that okay

405
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
And they're going to Stage Terror attacks and they're going to everything else has

406
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
Do you understand that will say on the news that my followers

407
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Blow up the Pfizer building or something

408
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
I see Over the Horizon

409
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,608
This is just the same game he always plays

410
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Can you get placenta

411
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
But someone might

412
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Take a shot at Pfizer

413
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Whether it's

414
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,824
Some kind of property damage killing people or

415
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm some indiscriminate Act

416
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Domestic terrorism

417
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,760
It seems it seems like the temperature in the country among the people who do stuff like that

418
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
It's warm

419
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
It's in the it's in the higher register the temperature of Alaska right now which is not as cold as anybody would like

420
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
From there

421
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
That doesn't make me feel good

422
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
But it's kind of predictive

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
The way he always does this

424
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
UE makes me skydive

425
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
Decorations with there's going to be a false flag

426
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
And then when it doesn't happen

427
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
Hooray we stopped it right if it does happen

428
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Like someone goes in

429
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Does the act of terrorism

430
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
In advance

431
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
Perfect propaganda game part about it is

432
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,816
When you say when you tell people they're going to claim

433
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
That is my followers who

434
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Who did this

435
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,008
I would have an easier time believing you when you say that your followers would never do this

436
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,336
If you didn't have to immediately remind your followers

437
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Not to do it

438
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Hey guys

439
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
Now I've got to remind you guys please

440
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Don't blow up

441
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,576
We must blow up the Pfizer building politically

442
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
You're saying that they might

443
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
So

444
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,976
You might be confused like I very rarely

445
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Get into the Special Report

446
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,584
I don't really care to talk about Gregory surgery

447
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
But this is this one kind of

448
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Interested me and I think

449
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
I think I have a theory

450
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
About this why is this special report was made

451
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Last night I tried to go see Spiderman

452
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Where they admit

453
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Villain is Alex Jones

454
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,368
There's a snatch-and-grab robberies and shootouts at the mall we didn't know about

455
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Close

456
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
No one told us

457
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
So I think that's why John bound made the Special Report the beginning of the show

458
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,912
Alex was yelling about not being able to see Spider-Man and Josh Johnson opportunity to score some points

459
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Also Jay Jonah Jameson

460
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
Spider-Man character who's an a******

461
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
Make some for Alex to assume that his role in the film is much larger

462
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
I haven't seen the film but I've heard that they were

463
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Pretty much full Alex with

464
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,904
The characters onscreen there's no way as narcissism is going to allow him to experience that is the Moon

465
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
Movie portraying

466
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
You have to secretly be with the movies actually about

467
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,840
He's the real bad guy

468
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
It is funny

469
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
Especially because

470
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Unlike

471
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Other superhero movies

472
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
They really

473
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
How did the cast of villain

474
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
When's with this one

475
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
Stick up villains from movies that aren't in the same universe

476
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,856
From the original Spider-Man with Tobey goddamn Maguire Goblin

477
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,696
Somehow I was like well obviously I'm the most important character

478
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:16,352
You have three Spider-Man Spider-Man

479
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,192
Is the Green Goblin in Spider-Man Spider-Man Spider-Man

480
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,592
A person feeling Billy Billy Billy feeling Alex is still somehow convinced he's the super villain in this story

481
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
I like it

482
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Kind of fun he's the comic foil

483
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,136
This guy is he doesn't even know when the superheroes in front of

484
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Got to get that vigilante Peter Parker

485
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,656
It's ironic that he's my main source of income

486
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Yasso Alex believes

487
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Himself

488
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
To be the villain

489
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,616
0 superpowers that which is kind of which is kind of a bummer

490
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
They made Alex into the villain to Spider-Man because

491
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
I mean not afraid

492
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
It's not like I'm up here saying oh look

493
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
I'm the villain in the Spider-Man movie

494
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,232
They're coming after us folks they're not doing stuff

495
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
And admitting the director yeah this is an Alex Jones character

496
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,984
About Spider-Man and

497
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Does all this evil crap

498
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
Why do you think they do things like that to me

499
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,920
Cuz what you doing

500
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,648
Rico.com

501
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Thousand bucks football game

502
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,816
500000 box 200 something dollars is 25% off

503
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Horses

504
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
Might be able to continue on

505
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,872
Almost no way that couldn't be intentional

506
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
Beautiful beautiful

507
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
If that's not self-aware that's

508
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Most embarrassing

509
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:17,952
You can't you cannot tell me that's not self-aware if it is not self-aware all of my beliefs about

510
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
What is possible are out the window why do they make a character of its all trying to sell

511
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Do you stuff

512
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
Volume body exactly what that is a parody of

513
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
He's asking me to take the bait on that

514
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
It's too good

515
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Can't be I just

516
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Like I can't get over this road but I really think that made that special report about

517
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Just because

518
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
Alex was mad that he couldn't go see Spider-Man because of this robbery at the mall

519
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
I'm being like I got to re-up on my contract instantly if I make this piece I've got a guarantee

520
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Another two years here

521
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
Or like Alex is having a real bad couple weeks

522
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
Like maybe you want to do something nice or around the holiday season

523
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
Down with the blaming him not being able to do that

524
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
Alex kicked off Twitter

525
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,696
I don't see any possibility that this is going to change

526
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
We have a little bit of difference in the status quo

527
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Now

528
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
Jack Dorsey

529
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
Gone shorter

530
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
He stepped down

531
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
So now

532
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,080
Going to do a brand Rehab on Jack Dorsey

533
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,248
Free Speech advocate

534
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Twitter

535
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
And that he was really on my side and I was told that

536
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
ITube

537
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
3 years ago during my deplatforming I didn't believe it

538
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
So I guess when I went and screamed at him and chase him around Congress that

539
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Lastdayonearth

540
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
I was naive

541
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
What

542
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
What's this song

543
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Havenly

544
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
Naive

545
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Everybody evil

546
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Then

547
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,232
Very well-known talk show host

548
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
To him

549
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
Always right

550
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
Alex Jones is his Guru

551
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,592
Yeah man

552
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Sure

553
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
You was

554
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,944
Razor thin ice

555
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,784
Better if he didn't kick Alex off Twitter than he would be gone

556
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
I mean if that's the

557
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
The case

558
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
He can't really talk about that now

559
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,536
Yeah yeah yeah. In charge of food already

560
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
But you don't have to worry about the board like I tried to keep Alex around really think that he's right about a whole lot of stuff

561
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
If I started a new platform Alex would be the number one person on it wait I'm in charge of square and he still on the phone

562
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Is there two and

563
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
I find this a little bit

564
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,648
Time and that's all that's all I'm saying I guess Rogan told him this

565
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:33,536
I mean DPW wouldn't super surprise me that a weirdo Tech billionaire

566
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
He's also a weirdo believer in Alex Jones

567
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
That's fine maybe

568
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,728
But this is like me going to a bar

569
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,824
Getting kicked out and insisting that the bouncer is a big fan of mine

570
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
I mean

571
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Because they

572
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah it was it works for the first few times and I said do you know who I am but the last time it didn't work

573
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Infowars

574
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
About to win

575
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
So that's the mindset we're at we're at the Wynn

576
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Sure things are things are good

577
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,912
Horses ride on The Cosby you were out on the couch

578
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
That's why we're in so much trouble

579
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Marshall Law head of the election

580
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Everything is do or die right now

581
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,968
We can track

582
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
Martial law is coming before the midterm sure so we'll see

583
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Xerox

584
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Get that one right

585
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
9 months

586
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,256
Yeah about maybe say that we'll see we'll see if we've got to we've got that coming

587
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
We get to the news now

588
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,632
Stila doing anything that I would

589
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,728
I would say is a blow up or is worthy of apologize

590
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Next day

591
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
So we just

592
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Just going to check in on some headlines

593
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
What's job

594
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Decipher this headline

595
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Retired generals urge Pentagon intakes

596
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Upcoming elections

597
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Decipher

598
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
Why do they has

599
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Shimmy's under his control

600
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Find control General

601
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
Call for martial law

602
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Animal action

603
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,480
Right there in that clip that's the perfect encapsulation of how I look

604
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Flies

605
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:35,392
He read the headline and then instead of engaging with any of the information in the article or attempting to learn anything further

606
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
He rewrites the headline into what he thinks or wants

607
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
This is legitimately what he does with everything

608
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
Which is probably why if you ask him about it

609
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
He wouldn't actually think he's a liar

610
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
He's telling the truth according

611
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
To the stories he comes up with by misreporting Headley

612
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,080
This was an op-ed generals wrote which

613
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Just published in the Washington Post

614
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
These generals were Paul Eaton Antonio's

615
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
Gooba and Stephen M Anderson

616
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,880
The reason they wrote this op-ed is primarily that the anniversary of January 6th is coming up so the idea of insurrection maybe on

617
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
People's minds

618
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
And what motivated them to put pen-to-paper is explained

619
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Text

620
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,560
We are chilled to our bones at the thought of acoustic

621
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Succeeding next time

622
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
It's clear from what went down on the 6th

623
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,008
That is their been better organization or even a little bit of luck and timing gone the other direction

624
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
We would have

625
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
Far greater consequences from that attack on the camp

626
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:32,224
Makes sense that people with over 30 year careers in the military might be a bit concerned the folks might

627
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
Not be taking things seriously enough

628
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
What creates a greater risk

629
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Worthy next

630
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Do a temptress

631
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Makes total sense

632
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,464
Really this article isn't about what Alex is even claiming it

633
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
To be at all because

634
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Just making things up about the headline

635
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,352
Making has nothing to do with martial law

636
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,704
It's about a concern that we're going to see a complete breakdown of the chain of command in the military

637
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,104
Paper to keep this argument on the stat that one out of 10 people charge regarding January 6th have service Wrecker

638
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,432
Among other disheartening signs that if things go bad

639
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
It's unclear how much

640
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,528
Japan impact disconnect being able to mobilize a response

641
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Against

642
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
Might be a challenge

643
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
It turns out

644
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,208
Similar to every military throughout his

645
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
History it's filled with fascists

646
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:22,400
A large part of the issue is they when you enlist your ultimately serving under the commander and chief

647
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
Many of the folks who are in the camp don't believe the Biden is legitimate or the rightful

648
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
Decent chance to be concerned about that dynamic

649
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
Essentially what they're calling for is laid out in the

650
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
Pentagon should immediately order a Civics review for all members

651
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Uniform

652
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,136
Pavilion on the Constitution and electoral integrity

653
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
There must

654
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,512
Also be a review of the laws of war and how to identify and deal with illegal orders

655
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,376
And it must reinforce unity of command to make perfectly clear to every member of the defense

656
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Department who play answer

657
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
No service membership

658
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Should say that they didn't understand who take orders from during a worst-case scenario

659
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,200
Wargaming the possibility of another violently contested election in 2024 so people aren't

660
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
Caught off guard

661
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
As they were last

662
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,600
I don't know any of this because he's only really read the headline news is making

663
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
Things up by what he thinks this article is about

664
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
This is how we covers news

665
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Which is to say that

666
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Doesn't

667
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,536
You just make scary stuff up and it tries to freak out his listener

668
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
There's motorboat

669
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
It comes out of his mind

670
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
I think

671
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
That's a

672
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Could could

673
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,728
Amanda Civics review for all

674
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
People

675
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,616
I remember is it when I was in high school required to take a

676
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Government class

677
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,224
What you doing continuing education program

678
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,552
I buy goddamn hope so

679
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
It turns out probably like I don't know that

680
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,440
Schools now those kids probably understand Civics better than I do

681
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
The problem is that the jurisdiction

682
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
Above them have no clue

683
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
The government class

684
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,912
We took in high school might have worn off

685
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
So Alex talked about this headline some more

686
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,568
Call for martial law

687
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
Texas from

688
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Do they

689
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
Disrupt

690
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Those are military terms

691
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
Horse feed

692
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Killing them

693
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Capturing them

694
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,472
Torturing them on the headline making up what he wants

695
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Sota mean

696
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Interesting Lee though the words degrade and disrupt

697
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Don't even appear in this op-ed

698
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:43,712
I really liked her I tried pretty hard to figure out where he was getting that from but I I'm not entirely sure

699
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,784
Like I tried to find repost things of this in like

700
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
Washington Times or Breitbart

701
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,160
But someplace that he must be pulling this from

702
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Even the articles on Infowars a newswars

703
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
And those articles don't

704
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,704
Disrupt I don't know I have a military operation

705
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,824
Make that up

706
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
But

707
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
Don't think he's making it up

708
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
I think it comes from somewhere

709
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,504
I just don't know where and it's not the opposite probably a

710
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
Call of Duty

711
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
That's why I feel like it's not just random lyrics

712
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,464
Yeah and if it was would be something

713
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
He's not one of his normal buzzword

714
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
Yeah that's the reason why I think there's there's a root of it somewhere I just can't figure it out

715
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:40,800
In the Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is like we got a degrading disrupt these goddamn Nazi zombies out here

716
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,896
So Alex finally gets to Kick the Can down the road

717
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
He's talked about this headline

718
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
He's complained about not being able

719
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Spider-Man

720
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,088
And now it's time to really get down

721
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
And that is

722
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Talking about Trump

723
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Going

724
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,488
On that show with O'Reilly and

725
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:05,888
Vaccine

726
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,984
You should get it you.

727
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Happy about this

728
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
So I see Trump in these big rallies

729
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,896
Thousand fifteen thousand 20 thousand

730
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,480
Thousand with Bill O'Reilly

731
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
Auditoriums in rental stadiums and do that

732
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,400
Here's Bill O'Reilly you know he's making jokes

733
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
What movie stars they are

734
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Flashlight away

735
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
Looks good that's great

736
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Who cares about all that

737
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Point

738
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
You want to hear about

739
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
The New World Order

740
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
It's being used

741
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
The global ID and social credit score

742
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Now been put into place

743
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Nothing

744
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:14,752
Isn't saying the things that I would want them to because he doesn't believe any of the things that Alex's

745
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Convince himself

746
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
The Trump believe

747
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,128
Over the past years Alex got so high on how Trump was

748
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
Such an a****** really mad

749
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
Control the fake heroic version of trump

750
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
He created to sell that the audience

751
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
That version of trump isn't real

752
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
Going to lean into it

753
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Is really pathetic to watch

754
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,352
Like I went to overcommitted on this really stupid bet and I was just being is left holding the bag

755
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
Expected

756
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Explained to the audience

757
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
The hero total

758
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Only knew everything about

759
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Evil globalist

760
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
We've confirmed with Alex about this stuff behind the scenes

761
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Metal seems to be acting

762
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,663
Completely counter to that understanding weird

763
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,759
It's probably going to be easily diverted if you would have just stuck with Rand Paul back

764
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
In 2015

765
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Ears of integrity

766
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
He could have had

767
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,719
I mean it's it's hard to Sarah propagandist back a loser

768
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
It's hard to say like

769
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,559
Oh he's a sleeper Patriot agent

770
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,375
And now he's awake and then he's the president and then when he's

771
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,959
Not present here like I see he's back to being a sleeper Patriot agent

772
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Until he's asleep now

773
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
I like now you know

774
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
You can't put that back in the bag

775
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
No it's it's

776
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,383
Kind of embarrassing

777
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Flashback

778
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,735
Think about all the stuff Alex has said about Trump

779
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Besides stupid

780
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
Positive

781
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
Calling him Moses

782
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,999
If you are someone like Alex

783
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Back a loser

784
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
Back of loser

785
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Cannot risk

786
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,679
The person that you you were in bed with women

787
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Worst possible thing

788
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
Because of propaganda

789
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Can't win

790
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
By Design

791
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359
That's not their job their job is not to win the winner is the

792
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
Military or whoever insta

793
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
Attitudes fascism

794
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
The propagandas job is always to get

795
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
People to the point where they'll accept fast

796
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,367
It's a terrible idea to do that before there's Bashas

797
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,463
We'll probably cameras aren't going to really serve any productive role

798
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Even if we even what you're saying

799
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
In terms of governor

800
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
You know like you're not able to really

801
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
That's why we see like over the course of

802
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
Trump's presidency and obsession with the

803
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
The Deep state

804
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
Write all of these secret attacks that are trying on on

805
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Trump

806
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
And look as you still have to be that opposition thing

807
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
You just could avoid it by

808
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,807
Insisting on emotional and intellectual integrity

809
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Text Rand Paul is

810
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Is the candidate who

811
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
I mean he came from

812
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Be the best totally absolutely

813
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
He's never going to win

814
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
You can save face

815
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Oh well

816
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,007
So now you're left with like the skeleton

817
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
The bone

818
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Of your past

819
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
Support

820
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,663
Him up there with Bill O'Reilly

821
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,479
As I got all these guys they're just stuck in a world of

822
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
Glamour and Glitz

823
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
And helicopters

824
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
They're still in the normal world of golf courses in

825
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,999
Helicopters in their supermodel lives in

826
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
Everybody goes like it's a big event

827
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Undergoing

828
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,655
Rock and roll band they're going to see George Strait

829
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,103
Where all the celebrities who are all the people Americana

830
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
They're nowhere to be seen

831
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,759
I know that I was a fan of George Strait's music

832
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,087
Can you play songs like Amarillo by Morning as Bumper Music

833
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,183
But I'm not sure that he has much of a grasp on who George Strait is

834
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,535
In May of last year George Strait released a PSA encouraging people to wear a mask

835
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Can practice social distancing

836
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
Along with Governor Abbott

837
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
He's currently on tour and proof of vaccination and or proof of a negative covid test are required at 3 for most of the venues

838
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,567
Except for like at 1 today

839
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
It was unclear about his

840
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Like a rodeo

841
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,967
Maybe that one I'm not sure you never know with the rodeo

842
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,783
Simmons Bank Arena is actually requiring everyone to wear masks

843
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Upper the George Strait

844
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,135
King of country music

845
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
You know what

846
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
Jeff Bezos his cousin

847
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,255
So the f*** what

848
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,887
Alex is looking for him to be politically

849
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
I just picked that

850
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,495
You're not he's not going to come out with an anti-vax Anthem like

851
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,567
Eric Clapton but yeah yeah

852
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,151
George Strait

853
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
Alex's prefers the image

854
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
George Strait gives off

855
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
With his cowboy hat

856
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
And

857
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Amarillo by Morning

858
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,439
I got it I got to oceanfront property in San Antonio

859
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Stacked

860
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
Oceanfront property in

861
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Arizona

862
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
From my front yard I can

863
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
See the seat

864
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,727
Great songs

865
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
SMS guitar

866
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,871
Yes I do George Strait

867
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
Sounds like this

868
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
Beside e of the trumpet

869
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Provoke

870
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Can't really

871
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Deal with that

872
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:19,391
I think there's a little bit of trouble understanding that

873
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Can't be

874
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Against the vaccine

875
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,511
Cuz he needs to take credit for it right

876
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,143
Unlike a visceral narcissism level

877
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Like Trump can't be like

878
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
This thing

879
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
That is

880
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,823
The crowning achievement of my presidency even people on the left

881
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Are like well

882
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
Trump did

883
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,735
To go along with Lightspeed and we were able to make a vaccine much quicker

884
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Got to give it up

885
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
On that front

886
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:53,695
Which is wild cuz I think the smartest move for trump it is to say that he was against the vaccine in those elements in the Deep state that did it

887
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:59,583
Tell you if he ever wants to get elected he's going to have to what he has to say

888
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
It seems like Alex is mad about is that

889
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,959
Trump is moving towards those other Republican

890
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
And not

891
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,055
Embracing Alex again which I think is

892
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,615
Probably sorry for Trump to do

893
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,199
Nope should be on the Alex's team right now

894
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
F****** showing up on info

895
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
Maybe I mean

896
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
I think if he

897
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,903
The goal is just to like rise back

898
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
To the presidency

899
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Then maybe

900
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
That is the

901
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
I think the

902
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
The damaged

903
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
If you can

904
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Could do her

905
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
There I don't know it seems like

906
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
It seems like he's not

907
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Inherently

908
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,431
On board with a lot of a little bit

909
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
But I thought he was a True Believer damn you know I mean I saw what he's done for his entire

910
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
Our life but then I thought he'd really changed entirely just by

911
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,767
Distill doing exactly what he's done exiled guy who did a photoshoot in a apartment

912
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,583
Made of gold is a 3.0 weird

913
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,191
Popular is not a popular

914
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
This isn't a problem

915
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,615
He should be talking about January 6th

916
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,663
And how they wouldn't let him know that Sean Gardner

917
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
He should be talking about the

918
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
We are rolling knows all about it

919
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
He should be at the Deep State and the New World Order

920
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
He should be talking about

921
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
How many people are

922
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,743
Poison injections

923
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,775
Mass death

924
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
The crime

925
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
Human history

926
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Absolutely not

927
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,671
Show with L like this we don't have much of

928
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Not much hope

929
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
Emma Wars is on the cusp of great

930
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Success

931
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
We don't have much help because we l

932
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,191
Winning but there's no hope for us to convoluted message so far

933
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,847
I get I get where I was coming from it's basically just a like Trump please validate these

934
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:24,479
Completely non true things fright that I am selling as as my my narratives

935
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
I think it would be a really be helpful

936
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Right buddy

937
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Remember when we had a good thing

938
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,671
Sing going yeah man make people angry about

939
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
The things I want

940
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
To get attention

941
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Confirm

942
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
And that then we can

943
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
We can do this

944
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,703
Yeah if you start making people real mad and say that the vaccine was created by the Deep State when you were the president whom

945
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
Made it happen

946
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
That's going to make people go f******

947
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
Nuts man

948
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:54,943
And then maybe they'll forget about all these things they're suing me about in job at Bob January 6th

949
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
Let's overthrow the country buddy

950
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Reality those

951
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
The Trump has a

952
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
A real rapper

953
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Opportunity

954
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
And that is a chance

955
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Transcend the left

956
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,183
Alright paradigm

957
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Bye

958
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,487
Coming out again

959
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,327
What's the vaccine I'm not sure but this is just sad

960
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Left right

961
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
He could come out and say he was wrong they lied to him

962
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,495
Instead he knows now

963
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Ski sign on to it

964
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
Until he's decided

965
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
We lost respectfully asking him

966
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
To help save the children

967
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Just say no

968
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Not going to do that

969
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,879
Schumer and Bill Gates

970
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
Really

971
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
I know you're making a

972
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,799
Uses for wild wild weird he's one of the most fires

973
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,127
Tell that to the biggest crime of the century now you know he's into.

974
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
Doctors know so what are you going to do

975
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,039
We looked up to him and we begged him to save us and he said no

976
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,927
Yeah I think the biggest I think the biggest realization that Alex is having is that

977
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
If Trump really wanted to do this thing

978
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,095
After seeing the almost complete lack of consequences for starting

979
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,143
The January 6th insurrection

980
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:23,007
He could actually cause a real Revolution right now

981
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
Can go for it and he can't

982
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Don't know if it be

983
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Successful

984
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,407
I don't know who do whatever he wants

985
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,991
A lot of trouble

986
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
And he's not

987
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
No

988
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,599
And you got to ask you a question ask yourself why then

989
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,439
Cuz it would be really hard to lead a war against the United

990
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
As people who've run the United

991
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Midstate snow

992
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Diablo

993
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
So

994
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
Trump bad now

995
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
Bees not going to save the children

996
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Malik Baker

997
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,007
Him to save the children and he said no silence might have to go

998
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Protest

999
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
Have fun

1000
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
What's a dick

1001
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
BBS in history consult the

1002
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
Very important

1003
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,391
Our children dying in Mash our children having major health problems

1004
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,463
This injection not protecting them being a fraud

1005
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,815
Oh it works wonderfully oh just get it

1006
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,911
The Dallas Crowd Oh I just got the booster

1007
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Get the shot

1008
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
His constituents to take

1009
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
Southeast poison

1010
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
Bill Gates is venom

1011
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
About this

1012
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
But

1013
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Why

1014
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
Follow him around the country protest his ass

1015
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
Evil

1016
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
We know Bill Gates is super Wicked

1017
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
But I mean really Donald Trump

1018
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Is that a prion

1019
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Is it spring on this first

1020
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
See if see if man upstairs wants

1021
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Steve

1022
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
Protest

1023
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
What actually I mean I would

1024
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,783
Based on the things that Alex has said about Trump in the past

1025
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
How like

1026
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,855
God wanted him to be president and

1027
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,647
All this like he was chosen

1028
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
He's got game

1029
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,487
I would assume that God would tell Alex

1030
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
Text to chill out

1031
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:27,679
Even understand what's going on here

1032
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
That was my idea I wasn't

1033
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,103
Idea

1034
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
It seems like

1035
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
Talkingshit

1036
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,783
Just pretending that he has the religious conviction

1037
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Things that he does

1038
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
If he did

1039
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
He's being a

1040
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
Remarkable blast

1041
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,207
How do you think about the reality of what he's

1042
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,767
He's described the vaccine as is a

1043
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Population

1044
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Destroyer

1045
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,655
A genocide weapon a genocide weapon

1046
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
I wouldn't be like

1047
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
If burn

1048
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
Bernie Sanders is like listen

1049
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,943
I know you agree with me on everything but I do support Hitler I would need to pray about it I was like

1050
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
How to send on 95% of staff for killing everybody

1051
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
That's a big 5

1052
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,631
I just have proportional 95%

1053
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Yeah

1054
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
Infrastructure

1055
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
I disagree with him on killing all of human life but

1056
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,895
You know what that's 50/50 I don't know which way I'm going to go I still

1057
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
Even listening to a show pretty regularly I

1058
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,991
Can't really tell you

1059
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
If the

1060
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,087
Plan is supposed to be that the vaccine will kill everyone

1061
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
Or if it's a bureaucratic thing

1062
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Like to get us

1063
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
Stabbed vaccine passports

1064
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,447
Are doing great situation actually is

1065
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:09,567
We will get to reset Wars eventually but that is coming

1066
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,151
Anyway Alakazam theories about why Trump is

1067
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Provax

1068
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
Donald Trump

1069
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,039
That hates the UN and hates the globalist doesn't trust the system

1070
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
Months ago

1071
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,623
People have a booster

1072
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
Are they running that scam

1073
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
Did you just say that

1074
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,375
And I will give Jared a billion bucks or something and you just say that shot screen

1075
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
How many she get

1076
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Can you do this

1077
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
What

1078
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,287
Whole show asking what the hell's going on with Trump

1079
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
You kind of all right now I mean

1080
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
Wow deep into the subject matter

1081
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
Papa's doing now for the past four years getting boring

1082
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
Opposition to the boosters and those public comments he made

1083
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
Manufacturers to give Jared Kushner a payoff

1084
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
In exchange for Trump supporting the boosters

1085
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
But first of all this kind of sounds like something a frontman for

1086
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Consortium

1087
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,935
East Coast might do

1088
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,775
Right lighter that kind of behavior listen you don't get me a lot of money

1089
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,639
People don't get your vaccine I'm just saying I'm not saying that I'm going to do anything I'm just saying I'm just making a point

1090
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Secondly though

1091
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,783
While but Alex again speculate this scenario is a sort of thing that he could believe Trump

1092
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Might be doing

1093
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
And not ask himself

1094
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,927
Maybe drop was capable of this sort of thing for the past few years

1095
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
Use the second coming of John the Baptist

1096
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,167
Honestly there is a small amount of schadenfreude listen

1097
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:47,359
Did Alex abrines audience like this little bit sad

1098
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,175
Oh haha you finally got your comeuppance

1099
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
It's him transferring his

1100
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
Misery onto his body

1101
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,343
He knew Trump was polish it the entire f****** time

1102
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Enter now he's just

1103
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,231
Boy acting as though he was betrayed the reality is everybody's been betraying everybody

1104
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,279
Accept because

1105
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,351
That is the way that you can make this season

1106
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Profitable exact

1107
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Bye-bye pretending

1108
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,495
Play acting like you were conned by this

1109
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,567
You can make a villain and create a whole new way to salvage

1110
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
You know whatever you can

1111
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,687
This seventy-five-year-old lifelong conman

1112
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
I think he might have conned

1113
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Yes

1114
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Big Year

1115
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
Last year

1116
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
Is pretty big

1117
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Years this year

1118
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
Flexradio

1119
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Biggest

1120
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,631
2022 is going to be show deciding

1121
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,935
Every other year in your life

1122
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
Look like Child's Play

1123
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Guarantee

1124
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
We're only

1125
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
11 days out

1126
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,247
11 days out

1127
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
From Destiny

1128
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Right now

1129
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
What

1130
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
It starts on New Year's

1131
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,023
Run from all this

1132
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,655
But at the same time watching

1133
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,959
Everybody else sit there unconscious

1134
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
Eyewear how much trouble we're all in collectively

1135
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,823
Want to just jump off a cliff

1136
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
You know what I mean

1137
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
But here's the problem

1138
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
I can't just jump through a portal

1139
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
World

1140
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
Because there is no new world

1141
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,391
Its Global government and the same crap

1142
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Everywhere

1143
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:42,303
No matter where you go really sounds like someone who could benefit from the lessons

1144
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:47,423
There's no new world he can drop into his million worlds a trillion world

1145
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:54,079
The goal was don't get to constrain his reality and dictate the options he is a light being

1146
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
According to himself

1147
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
The most important work of his career

1148
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:04,063
I recognize that we have a cover the reason Awards episodes yet but knowing the sort of bulshit he's selling in those videos the tone of this act

1149
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
April show

1150
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
Is hilarious

1151
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
Also I think of Alex Everest

1152
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,463
Guarantee guarantee

1153
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
He should be forced to do that

1154
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,655
It is a little bit like you wouldn't listen to Amitabha Buddha so much if he was say

1155
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,775
A bipolar lunatic who is screaming that you are going to be saved and you are not going to be saved

1156
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
You should detach and you shouldn't detach

1157
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:32,479
Simultaneous

1158
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
Baby

1159
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,807
You learn too much about Buddhism in you get a miserable in truck

1160
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
Pat science

1161
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,879
What I thought was really strange

1162
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
Is

1163
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
Alex is not throwing out the baby with

1164
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Bathwater

1165
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
Inasmuch as

1166
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Look fucktrump with his back

1167
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Text stuff

1168
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:53,983
But I'm going to hold on to the election conspiracies the rightful president

1169
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,079
Severely you still the rightful dead

1170
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
And we can't get President Trump who is the real president

1171
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,919
Wonder landslide

1172
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:05,503
If we can't get him on the most Central of issues

1173
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,879
He's coming out

1174
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,207
The only Silver Lining is Democrats that hate you so much

1175
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
You know what

1176
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
Even if I would like

1177
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:29,055
If you believe any of what they're trying to explain to you that's of you

1178
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
Like it's hurting my brain to understand it

1179
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
And I know they're lying

1180
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Sure you know

1181
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,039
Is a betrayer

1182
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Who is

1183
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:44,671
Chicken jump companies for billions at the same time

1184
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,023
She is the rightful president who is also still president I actually

1185
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Drink that makes sense

1186
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Alex's world

1187
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Like I do think

1188
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,447
Otherwise you've got to undo all of thee like

1189
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,519
Stop the steal stuff

1190
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
Walk-back

1191
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
All of the

1192
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,407
Stuff that led to January 6th

1193
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
Coverage that you did

1194
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:13,087
All of the Smoking Gun proof of election fraud that's got to be thrown out and you don't think

1195
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
Alex would want to do that

1196
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,975
And it kind of raise the stakes a little bit while we have the rightful president

1197
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
Yeah

1198
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:26,911
All the presidents are committing genocide president

1199
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
Wow

1200
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
Nobody

1201
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,311
Very very few

1202
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,639
People who identify as Democrats

1203
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
Is are not going to get the vaccine

1204
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Because Trump support

1205
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,063
Yeah I think that maybe there'd be a couple of frames outliers

1206
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,647
But most people aren't that kind of Oppositional defiant

1207
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
Yeah Alex is

1208
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,511
Yeah so he would make a healthcare decision based on

1209
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,071
Who supported or who's against absolutely

1210
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,655
100% everybody else does that too and that's

1211
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Really

1212
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
Childish she

1213
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:05,311
A little bit it's a terrifying thought

1214
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Yep

1215
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
So

1216
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
Man

1217
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
Alex gets into his lawsuit

1218
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
The government

1219
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
You're going to win

1220
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:20,159
Thought we did it episode why you were gone with the Android

1221
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
Thank you very much and ra

1222
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,303
This is depressing

1223
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
And like I'm not even

1224
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
No hope for this lawsuit

1225
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,167
Listen to Alex

1226
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Talk about it I don't think

1227
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
He has any hope for it either

1228
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,031
We found a big suit

1229
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,847
I guess the January 6th committee United States history

1230
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
Court District

1231
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407
Columbia

1232
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,271
Select Committee

1233
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Benny

1234
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,343
G Thompson Elizabeth

1235
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Call Cheney

1236
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
Susan

1237
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
And the rest of the monthly

1238
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Here is

1239
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
Lawsuit

1240
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,495
We're going to be taking action

1241
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,311
In many other ways to fight

1242
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,503
They are going after Everybody's Free Speech everybody's right

1243
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
To assemble

1244
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
With this garbage

1245
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Make

1246
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Blush

1247
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
Tolls going up on cam

1248
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
Any minute

1249
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Thursday

1250
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
And there's explosive

1251
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Magazine

1252
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
That is very historical

1253
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
Extremely

1254
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Extremely

1255
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
Important

1256
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,111
Yeah. Sounds like it

1257
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
I'm going to take a break for a while I may just leave

1258
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,047
I just a country

1259
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,143
I just

1260
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,959
That's why you're all going to die

1261
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,543
What what

1262
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,431
We switched over and we're all going to die real quick

1263
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,551
Like honestly don't know what happened

1264
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,879
Have you ever been in the bus

1265
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
You know

1266
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
All those people

1267
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Bus

1268
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:36,607
All of a sudden a bicyclist comes out of nowhere the bus driver Slams on the brakes and the one person who hadn't got

1269
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,167
Other hand on the thing just click enough goes

1270
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
Flying forward

1271
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,239
That's what I feel like right now it's

1272
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
The inertia

1273
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Coronavirus

1274
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
This could hurt yourself force of gravity was

1275
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
Brutal

1276
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
So I think Alex

1277
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,711
Maybe doesn't understand what

1278
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
In the lawsuit even I may be as a

1279
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
Really grasp it yet like a bad Norm

1280
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,855
Paris Road it all up or whatever

1281
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,695
Emphasis

1282
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Get any sense

1283
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
He's like I am a champion I'm going to take it to the January 6th

1284
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
Committee is getting sued by Chobani we were ready to fight to the end

1285
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
Well it's historical

1286
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Bandits

1287
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,223
Important

1288
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,807
Those descriptors descriptors or a discussion of what

1289
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
The suit is actually about

1290
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
And then a long pause

1291
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,463
And we're all going to die

1292
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,511
6 things series

1293
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
I mean

1294
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,583
Is he taking it seriously

1295
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,375
I don't know

1296
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
Anybody leave

1297
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Alex is in a bad mood again

1298
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,455
I was wondering when we were going to get to everybody

1299
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,527
Yeah where is there and now it's time to talk more about Trump

1300
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
Easy bum

1301
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
Okay

1302
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,647
That's why you're all going to die

1303
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,695
Global is are injecting

1304
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,255
Children with deadly poison

1305
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,095
Trump is running around

1306
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
Stupid red dye

1307
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:25,663
You are playing into their hands and destroying yourself and signing yourself onto the New World Order

1308
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,735
Idiot Bill O'Reilly

1309
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Credible joke

1310
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:37,439
They are the problem with Bill O'Reilly wasn't whether or not he could pick up women

1311
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
Smartbud

1312
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,023
Serial sexual harasser

1313
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,839
The same thing of sexually harassing someone

1314
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Language is

1315
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Little troubling

1316
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,775
Also has a chameleon

1317
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:57,919
And it was his show was before he was a president

1318
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
His presidency

1319
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,527
That's why he's doing that

1320
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
About

1321
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:07,135
Watching something that was eminently predictable coming

1322
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:13,535
True is that it is not satisfying whenever you predict something that comes true I think that's the thing

1323
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,375
Okay about this Trump coming out in

1324
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,775
For the vaccine Alex getting mad about it all of them fighting with each other about it

1325
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
People we all saw it coming

1326
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
And it's not

1327
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,431
Satisfying kind of like haha I predicted I would win but you know why

1328
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,735
Here's why it's

1329
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Not satisfied

1330
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,319
It looks like it in the terms of trump like coming out

1331
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
Supporting the vaccine

1332
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,927
It's not it's not satisfying because it's like well

1333
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
The least you could do

1334
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
It's kind of like

1335
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
Absence of a negative

1336
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Really like

1337
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,143
Energems

1338
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,191
Kind of know that the people who really need

1339
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,239
I hear that message aren't going to hear it even

1340
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,055
Alex

1341
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,871
Him saying this stuff doesn't really give you that kind of boost

1342
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
Because we've been

1343
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
Here too many times

1344
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,759
Like I'm not even fully convinced he's turning on Trump

1345
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Things are pretty harsh stuff

1346
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,087
Totally I still live

1347
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
I'll believe it when I see it

1348
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
Like him out there with a bullhorn

1349
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,207
At a trump rally

1350
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:19,071
Trump for prison shirt believe it whenever you're Trump actual

1351
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,375
Billy finally does shove Isis up his dirty a******

1352
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,655
Yeah that'll be the day

1353
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
The day

1354
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
Alex's got to go to a Greg

1355
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Report

1356
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,591
Who got to get off there

1357
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
So he tries

1358
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,199
But then they either start Tagalog

1359
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
I just can't

1360
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
Get back on there anymore

1361
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
So let's just are that

1362
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
I'm not trying to be dramatic here I just

1363
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,863
Seriously

1364
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:58,495
Everybody have what you want that ship and Pelosi rob you

1365
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:08,991
He's too busy and their own candy-ass BS

1366
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,927
You look at it analyzed at this ain't human

1367
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,023
You people need to wake up and rally against it

1368
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Hello that like

1369
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:30,495
Rebroadcast I might never come back I'm not saying this to be too dramatic and then I'm going to proceed to do the most dramatic yet

1370
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Possible

1371
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:38,175
We're fighting a alien people are too wrapped up and going to work everyday

1372
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,479
And having families and all that s***

1373
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,295
To really get down to brass tacks and realized

1374
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
Bring that we are fighting an Intergalactic rep

1375
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,159
Representation of the literal Christian devil

1376
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Cool

1377
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:55,839
Little more time off

1378
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:00,447
Remember he showed up an hour and 47 minutes

1379
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,239
Time off before the show

1380
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Okay little

1381
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:09,151
Prediction before the midterm

1382
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
We're going to get martial law

1383
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
Tonight will track that

1384
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,807
You make another prediction on this clip that did not come

1385
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,623
You know big text announcing new lock

1386
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,255
Years ago

1387
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,351
Is announcing that they're closing

1388
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,423
I had all the other lockdowns in Biden tomorrow

1389
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,471
Going to make some new bigger County in

1390
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Ignoring

1391
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Natural immunity

1392
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,759
Totally ignoring real science

1393
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,551
I would think that Alex would be thrilled

1394
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
Davos is canceled

1395
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
He hates that s***

1396
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
I mean yeah

1397
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,487
Big Tech decides to do with their own workplaces I don't really know what that has to do with it

1398
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
It's meant

1399
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
To precipitate

1400
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,399
New lockdown because

1401
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,983
These things are locking down the argument that he's making but

1402
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,007
It's dumb

1403
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
Zirconia new Lockdown from vaccinated people the next day so

1404
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,967
Teddy never made

1405
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,759
To maintain the image that he's consist

1406
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Bentley Wright

1407
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
In fact

1408
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:23,391
The opposite of what Alex said would happen on December 22nd

1409
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
When the Supreme Court decided to hear arguments

1410
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
Regarding the legality of Biden

1411
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,511
Vaccine mandate

1412
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,559
Also let's not forget

1413
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
These aren't even

1414
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,631
Blanket vaccine mandates that are in place

1415
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:39,007
They only apply to companies with 100 or more employees and they require proof of vaccination

1416
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:44,895
That employee that doesn't want to get vaccinated has to get tested weekly and wear a mask at work

1417
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
Almost sounds like

1418
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,247
Unnecessarily permissive insanely permissive that's

1419
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
That's a ridiculous thing

1420
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,623
Is a provision within the vaccine

1421
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
That allows for the if you don't want to

1422
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:05,631
Build stuff like that in there cuz not everybody can be vaccinated

1423
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Pencil

1424
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
Anyway

1425
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,055
Is it the whole idea that there's going to be like all this news

1426
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Of

1427
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
The 22nd

1428
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,759
Possibly overturn this man.

1429
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,087
The speech the next day

1430
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,135
On December 21st which is

1431
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,047
This is a speech to they gave about covid and they opted

1432
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Coming holiday

1433
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,607
There was no lockdown talk

1434
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
This is how we address the unvaccinated

1435
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,727
All these people who have not been vaccinated

1436
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:46,591
You have an obligation to yourselves to your family quite frankly I know I'll get criticized for this

1437
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
To your country

1438
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,151
Get vaccinated now it

1439
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
It's free it's convenient I promised you would save lives

1440
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,039
And I honest-to-god believe it's your patriotic Duty

1441
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,623
As far as like rousing speeches from presidents to people to

1442
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,671
Will step up and do their patriotic duty this

1443
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,695
Doesn't rank is

1444
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Anywhere near the most

1445
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Inspiring

1446
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Western with Rhett

1447
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,863
More like an exhausted parent trying to get kids

1448
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
Intervention

1449
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
The only thing we have to fear

1450
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,007
Is all of you being afraid of the wrong

1451
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,823
F*** is wrong with you

1452
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,431
Any speech he literally address be concerned with rice

1453
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,759
In cases would be heading back to how things were in March 2020

1454
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,807
And he explicitly made it clear the

1455
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:33,183
The sorts of locking down that we did then are not necessary now give him a different variables were facing

1456
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:38,303
Not least of which being the difference in how many people are vaccinated over 200 million

1457
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,119
Versus how many were vaccinated and which is exactly zero

1458
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,191
He did kind of call out people like Alex

1459
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,495
But even in this case he was just empathy

1460
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,311
Bentley begging with Liars to stop lying

1461
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,895
Look Beyond vaccinated starting with look

1462
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,247
Just just softer than listen

1463
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,831
Look younger accelerated are responsible for their own choices

1464
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
But those choices have

1465
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:05,951
Open field by dangerous misinformation on cable TV in social media

1466
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:11,583
You know these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and a lot of misinformation that

1467
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
Can kill Theron

1468
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
Consumers in their own support

1469
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,495
It's wrong it's immoral and I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation

1470
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Stop it

1471
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Stop it now

1472
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:25,151
That's my president

1473
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,015
I mean oh my God

1474
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:36,159
I think in terms of what you can do as a president maybe that's about is

1475
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,719
Are there as harsh as you can be

1476
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:45,119
Without without possibly drifting into Lexington laws of some sort or another

1477
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:50,751
Get into a person Amendment chilling kind of conversation

1478
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,687
But eventually we have to live in a world where you can say look at these f****** Liars we have proof they're lying there lying to

1479
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
Do you know they're lying to you I know they're lying to you

1480
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:10,975
Call Don the purveyors of those lies to stop

1481
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,255
Stop it now drawing words

1482
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:18,143
Talkingshit make bad predictions and that's pretty much his entire shout that didn't happen

1483
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,495
And we know that because we're it winter of it now

1484
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Oh man

1485
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
You like comedy

1486
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,127
I've heard of it

1487
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,711
Did you happen to see that clip of Jim Breuer

1488
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:36,319
That was going around no I heard of it and I saw what that people were

1489
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,855
Dunking on it and I was like

1490
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
Why why are we doing this

1491
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,463
It's whatever Year we're in now Jim Breuer can go f***

1492
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
Himself I don't need this

1493
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
So I said no

1494
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,583
Jim Breuer zombie reawakened America

1495
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,143
Annie had a little bit but he did

1496
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,727
There was

1497
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
People who like vaccines

1498
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,847
They're like cockatoos

1499
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,431
Because they go around and they're like

1500
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Falcon

1501
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Trust doctors

1502
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Lakehouse basically is better

1503
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Wow good

1504
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
That is exactly

1505
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,231
Exactly as good as everything else I've seen Jim Breuer do exactly

1506
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,583
Let's take one note and make a career out of it

1507
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,935
Jesus God so he he did that bit too

1508
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,519
I would say mediocre results even in that room

1509
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,847
And Alex was pretty good

1510
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,711
But they just repeat over and over again like

1511
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,487
Dallas conference

1512
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
Weekend

1513
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
This weekend

1514
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
Weekend

1515
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
William hawrelak

1516
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
And it was all freaking out about a making fun of it

1517
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,615
Show you

1518
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,919
A research paper they don't show you a statistic

1519
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,735
In the news

1520
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,599
Can you show me the news where the effects

1521
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
A bit ridiculous

1522
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
The left was

1523
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
Mad that Jim Breuer was make

1524
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,767
In front of them as much as they were

1525
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,791
Football socks

1526
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,583
Jim Breuer was getting booked

1527
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,375
Pretty amazing

1528
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,167
A2031

1529
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,727
That's not good they were laughing at how bad

1530
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,775
Construction of the the comedy lies

1531
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,127
I don't think anyone was really particularly worried about the

1532
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
The insult

1533
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:41,247
I don't think anyone was like

1534
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
Oh no

1535
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,111
Oh Jim breuer's got my number I mean

1536
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,183
There was a clip of me going around being like hey

1537
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,583
See the right they're all like I don't like to do that would be bad

1538
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,143
Comedy

1539
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,263
Posted all over Twitter and make fun of it because they were

1540
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,567
Somehow worried about how you're making

1541
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:10,175
In front of that I think my fear would be that he's what they would be worried about

1542
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
Let's test it out again or not

1543
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,463
Bugatti video

1544
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
So

1545
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
Alex has made a lot of prediction

1546
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Comes in his life

1547
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:32,447
Will you receive a couple here on this this episode 1 we're tracking until the midterm one that was

1548
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,215
Completely wrong

1549
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,495
But Alex

1550
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
His one failed prediction

1551
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
According to him

1552
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,359
We are ladies and gentlemen and

1553
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
I'm just sad to see this all that

1554
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
The only big one

1555
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
What do you think vibeszn announce tomorrow

1556
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:02,911
You ended the clip with the prediction that didn't come true but you said that you're only predict Sunday. Wrong is that you

1557
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
Stop it

1558
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,263
Dumb

1559
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,615
Alex reveals that he doesn't believe in only

1560
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:16,735
You are you are saying on the ground because he saying

1561
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,831
I think it's delightful that Alexandra refuses to call Atomic

1562
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,415
I'm fine with that I'm 100

1563
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,207
Yeah if you want to call it omnicron

1564
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,511
Have a great time

1565
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:34,399
The puppet president is set to announce measures tomorrow

1566
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
Across the u.s.

1567
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
Why I don't believe a word of it

1568
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,711
Wow

1569
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
That's nice

1570
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,575
To be fair I also don't believe in the omnicron

1571
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:58,207
That's that does sound like a totally made-up life they're not naming it correctly

1572
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,743
Just banging the drum on this predict

1573
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
So that's

1574
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
That's fun

1575
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,863
A story

1576
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,887
Cuz it's a little bit

1577
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
Off the beaten path

1578
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,471
Off the Trump news

1579
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,263
The guy

1580
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
In Canada

1581
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,080
What do a farmers market

1582
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
Okay

1583
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,504
Louis

1584
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
He was not vac

1585
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,088
Believe

1586
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,440
But he got into a fight with people who wouldn't let him out

1587
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:36,096
I believe that's probably the whole time probably with the attachment

1588
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,192
Anyway here's a little bit of that video

1589
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:46,848
Preventing me from getting food

1590
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
Temecula manager what's his name

1591
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,776
And all of her information is there

1592
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:21,408
I don't really care about this guy or this video at all particularly because at the end of it someone tries to offer him the option

1593
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,736
Making a list and someone will go get the food that he wants from the Farmers Market

1594
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
So the whole complained about not being allowed to buy food

1595
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Just dumb

1596
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:34,464
Alex is also trying to prevent the situation is like it being an open-air farmers market so it shouldn't matter

1597
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,048
That isn't a good argument so isn't it open

1598
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Farmers Market

1599
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:43,680
Super clear if you watch the video and the person working there

1600
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,496
To the guy that it's private property and is generally a performance

1601
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Headspace on a venue

1602
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,824
That's just where the farmers market is being held

1603
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:54,432
If you pay attention she says the name of the place and actually eventually the guy gets

1604
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
The flyer

1605
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,504
Either he shows on camera

1606
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,040
Escape Wychwood barns

1607
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,856
Knowing this week and then learn a little bit more

1608
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,624
About the situation

1609
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,416
Angola website

1610
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,976
You see that the interior of the space

1611
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
This is blocked off into

1612
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,536
Sweet we're different folks

1613
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Renteria.

1614
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
Branston sweet once

1615
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,656
62 is the Children's Art Studio

1616
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,728
Oh and 173 is home to a couple of Storytelling program

1617
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,080
The farmers market is in Suite 181 it is known as a

1618
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:27,456
There's an outdoor portion of it but the larger portion right now currently is indoor

1619
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,016
Which is where this guy in the video was trying to go to

1620
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,088
All the stops website they explicitly say quote

1621
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
Due to the unique multi

1622
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,648
To use nature of the building

1623
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Artscape

1624
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:40,000
The building operator requires all customers

1625
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,560
Enter the indoor portion of the Farmers Market

1626
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:46,656
Please have your Kudos receipt or qr-code ready with photo ID

1627
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,240
You don't have to be vaccinated to go outside the building

1628
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
But if you want to enter

1629
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
You have to follow the rules of Artscape

1630
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
The owners of the

1631
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
Property

1632
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:59,712
The website I'm not sure exactly how much this is the case cuz

1633
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
Anna Wintour and such

1634
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
But

1635
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,064
They did say that some people were still outside

1636
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,904
Yet if those people word still had booths outside could have gone to them

1637
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,024
I think the fact that the story is so thin and meaningless is

1638
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
Part of the reason that Alex has the hinge so much on

1639
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,352
The point

1640
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,912
This person correctly guy that her manager is a woman

1641
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,448
Like this is just rank massage

1642
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,056
It's amazing like he can't let it go even after you plays the video

1643
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
He wants you to know he's a beta

1644
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:34,272
I submit

1645
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,624
I want to talk to your manager

1646
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,976
Oh my gosh your woman's my boss

1647
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,768
It's okay you're killing me

1648
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
What

1649
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,376
It's just so dystopian

1650
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:54,496
So much nothing that he has to fall back on pretending that the employee was trying to exercise

1651
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,800
Some kind of power by saying their boss is a woman

1652
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:02,176
When a reality if you pay attention she only did that because the guy was talking about the manager and ask

1653
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
What is his name

1654
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
The only reason

1655
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,320
This person was not exercising power at all it was a

1656
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Yeah that's

1657
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
That's

1658
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,440
Wow that's infuriated you know in when I was in France

1659
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
Spell vaccine

1660
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:19,328
And when we got there we had to go we showed our vaccine card to the pharmacist

1661
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,656
Pharmacist write out a vaccine past put it on my phone everywhere I went

1662
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,448
All I did was show QR code

1663
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,008
They go beep and then I got to do whatever I wanted

1664
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,592
Fantastic I didn't have to have my

1665
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:37,248
Simcard carried around with me I didn't have to worry when I was inside a restaurant that nobody else around me was vaccinated I could have

1666
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,576
Just f****** scanned their backs on the on my phone and said it

1667
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,880
Amazing I want one of those

1668
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:46,464
It was absolutely not tyranny

1669
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
And

1670
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,328
Do you are a tyrant

1671
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,888
Alex decides that he wants to hear that

1672
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,912
Trump video again

1673
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
I don't know why

1674
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
It seemed to make

1675
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
I'm pretty mad

1676
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,288
And maybe a little bit sad

1677
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,408
But he does decide we're going to have to take a canker sore you can't stop

1678
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,712
You know how long do you think he makes it into the video

1679
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,552
I want to go with one and a half

1680
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
Corral

1681
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,536
I feel like somebody

1682
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Oh my gosh shop

1683
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,864
And then you got Trump

1684
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,424
Overhears Posey on our side sliding

1685
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
And then over here

1686
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
Pedophile leftist

1687
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
And you're just like

1688
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,384
How do you deal with something like this well

1689
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
You got to reach out to God

1690
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,480
I just going to be overwhelmingly dr. zelenko

1691
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,016
He's going to pray for God

1692
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
Holy spirit of discernment

1693
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,624
We're going to win in the end

1694
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
Again

1695
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,328
We did something that was historic

1696
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,936
Who

1697
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,264
Auditorium of tens of thousands of people in Dallas

1698
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:08,384
Did not do something at store

1699
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
Come up with the Pfizer shot

1700
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,272
Blood clotting agent

1701
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,856
Roll out the gene therapy that turns off your white blood cells

1702
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Do that

1703
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,488
What are the white blood cells turn off

1704
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,024
Tabata Ramen starch

1705
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:30,400
Start shutting down a diamond my buzz like I'm dying what's going on everything's dying

1706
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,800
And he's up there

1707
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,848
With Bill O'Reilly that joke

1708
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,200
He's up there with him I'm sorry

1709
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Girona Club

1710
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,904
I do like taking potshots at Bill O'Reilly and I enjoy that

1711
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
I think you were over

1712
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
Ice

1713
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,096
I think you said I think your prediction was too long I was thinking about it and I realized that my

1714
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,144
Mistake was in measuring it with

1715
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,192
Time value the word instead of

1716
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
Syllable

1717
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
Syllables

1718
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,056
And that was where I went wrong

1719
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,968
I should have I should have been like does he make it through 10 syllables this is why you play the game

1720
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,504
We can learn

1721
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,552
For next time next time

1722
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:23,648
Yeah I'm so bored listen

1723
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Nothing to this

1724
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
Disdain

1725
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,768
Constant repetition of these dumb covid

1726
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,536
Conspiracies

1727
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:34,656
But I kind of got lost in a little bit of a flight of fancy about personified blood cells

1728
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:42,336
I just got it.

1729
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,616
Cartoon

1730
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:50,016
Cosmosis Jones sure I work all let's all go to the lobby

1731
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296
Concessions

1732
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:56,416
Stand

1733
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,696
So

1734
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Do we get back

1735
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Alex

1736
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Back to listen

1737
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,304
How many syllables

1738
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
Are cantaloupe a good question

1739
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:07,168
I'm actually going to go lower I'm going to say 5

1740
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
5 syllable

1741
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:14,336
End-of-life worldwide we together all of us

1742
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,616
Not me we

1743
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,456
We got a vaccine done three vaccines done antrum

1744
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:23,552
Therapeutics like regeneron and other things that have saved a lot of lives

1745
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
We got a vaccine.

1746
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,904
In less than nine months

1747
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,672
To take from

1748
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
5 to 12 years

1749
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,000
Because of that vaccine

1750
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:43,520
Literally

1751
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,568
Kind of funny the way visible

1752
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
You do

1753
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,408
You Google goodbye I was wrong

1754
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,712
The safe money was on very short

1755
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
But

1756
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Yeah you went a little long

1757
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,904
I do enjoy that the way that Alec structures this kind of thing here

1758
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
Is like

1759
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
Trump Twitter

1760
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Never talked

1761
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
To Alex about these issues

1762
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,072
Answer this is Alex's way of kind of pretending they're having a debate

1763
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,096
Exactly

1764
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,680
That's kind of fun I'm talking to the TV because the TV is with me

1765
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:18,080
Yes and because man on TV won't talk to me doesn't talk to me anymore

1766
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
Because of that vaccine

1767
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,504
Millions and millions of people

1768
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,344
I think this would have been to Spanish Flu of 1917 worth

1769
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,624
Up to 100 million

1770
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,696
Because of adee

1771
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
Really sick and dying from

1772
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
Lockets

1773
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
People died

1774
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:47,264
This was going to ravage the country

1775
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
Far beyond what it is right now

1776
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
Take credit for it

1777
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,456
Take credit for the great what we've done is this

1778
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,040
Could you sign on believe it

1779
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
Bill Gates

1780
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
And and and and

1781
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,256
Most group in end

1782
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Peter jurasik

1783
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,144
The trumps on the TV

1784
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
With dezek

1785
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
I don't

1786
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,544
Weirdly gensaku

1787
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Pressed

1788
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,128
Presidential press

1789
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,432
Spokesperson

1790
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,456
I mean

1791
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,248
Dia DIA

1792
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,040
The idea that

1793
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Trump

1794
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Is taking credit

1795
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
Taking

1796
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Credit for the VAC

1797
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,744
Wouldn't even have been necessary

1798
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,328
Were it not for his actions at the beginning of the

1799
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:49,984
Probably but also

1800
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,312
However you do not get to claim credit for the win

1801
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
If you don't

1802
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,408
Get responsibility for the massive launcher

1803
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,688
I think I think

1804
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,992
Obviously be taken into

1805
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,256
When you sort of like old that I change

1806
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,072
If you don't want to take it you shouldn't be forced to take it

1807
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
No mandates

1808
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,752
But take credit because we save tens of millions of life

1809
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Away from you

1810
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:29,920
Okay so the president

1811
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,040
All right I mean that's

1812
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
If you

1813
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,648
She wants to take credit for this amazing backseat but

1814
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,184
I mean okay

1815
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
Okay

1816
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
Fine

1817
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
That's how it goes

1818
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:49,632
That's the way it is you get to take credit for the vaccine but I'll see you don't have to worry about it if you don't want to

1819
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,424
If you continue spreading it

1820
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,752
Because you don't take the vaccine you still get to take credit for the vaccine

1821
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032
Because you voted for Trump

1822
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,640
Even though you're not getting the vaccine and still actively strategy I do think it's a little bit can

1823
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
Confusing

1824
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,480
The framing of it where the audience

1825
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
Should take credit

1826
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
No

1827
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
Yeah

1828
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:16,512
No mandates.

1829
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,096
Anyway trumpet we get back to this invisawear he says he's boosted

1830
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:20,864
And Alex's

1831
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,888
Just like oh boy

1832
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,960
It makes me think that he didn't listen to all of this clip before

1833
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Yes

1834
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:57,472
You get to play God shut up there than in do all this crap and

1835
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,800
Play footsie with the Deep State that's fine.

1836
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,336
Not with killing the kids

1837
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
View

1838
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:14,112
I got to be dealt with it

1839
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:21,024
I thought you said earlier that he was looking good and he lost weight I have had a spare in hockey

1840
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,376
I guess that makes Alex the Beast ravaughn

1841
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,424
I don't know afternoon references

1842
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
2

1843
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,984
Get through this conversation

1844
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,288
So I think of this clip really is

1845
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
A good example of why Alex isn't embarrassing

1846
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,616
And childish coward

1847
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:41,760
He's now decided to because Trump isn't going to help him with his Sensational ass anti-vax narratives that he's bad

1848
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,552
Send out at the audience just move on

1849
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
Moving on his grave

1850
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,928
But it's missing the very essential step of reflecting on what went wrong

1851
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,488
How could the person that you routinely offer to

1852
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
To die for the person

1853
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:56,096
Constantly claimed knew all about the globals plans his whole life

1854
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,680
Everything was leading up whose presidency was Wipeout the commies

1855
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,752
The person you claim was communicating with you telepathically

1856
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,056
The person who sacrilegiously called Moses

1857
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:08,640
How could a person be the same person who's now bad because he disagrees with

1858
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:14,016
The self-reflection here is really important because if you do even the tiniest bit of it Yuri

1859
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,088
Realize that all that b******* for The Last 5 Years

1860
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
Didn't mean a thing

1861
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:21,952
He saw Trump as a potent weapon that he could use to attack the last in Progreso

1862
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:27,584
Causes primarily surrounding Civil Rights Voting Rights reproductive Health in any attempted gun regulation

1863
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,400
Purple such an a****** in an idiot such

1864
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,264
Please embarrassment that I was had to create a grandiose mythology around him

1865
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,616
In order to convince the audience to overlook the complete embarrassment he was on the surface

1866
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,432
This is essentially the same process Cuba not used

1867
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
The creative fake

1868
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,480
Hero to Rally around

1869
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,064
Really well for scamming in Griffith

1870
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,416
But eventually the real person isn't going to be able to live up to the fake version you created

1871
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Comes in

1872
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
Thankfully for Alex the point where he's decided he's got to lose the truck baggage is at the point where Trump himself doesn't really have any

1873
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Power that Alex

1874
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,656
Good Hope to use against

1875
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
The left

1876
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,008
He's out of the office and most importantly the bases moved on

1877
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,568
They've been radicalized past the Trump point

1878
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,640
You can see it when the audience Boos Trump 47 got the booster

1879
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:17,504
The person isn't really useful for Alex or any of these con men anymore

1880
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,296
So it's easy to cut bait now

1881
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,856
The key though is to just move on

1882
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,648
And not ask what the f*** happened

1883
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,512
Started doing that they realize that Alex and pretty much everyone in this right wing

1884
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
World

1885
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,608
This trumps cam community

1886
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,912
To them for political and financial purpose

1887
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,312
If they got around to asking even more questions they might realize that a couple months before endorsing him Alex said the Trump was a mobs

1888
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
The frontman for

1889
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,616
Consortium on the East Coast

1890
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,920
His whole personality and riches were fraud

1891
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,992
Afford the risk of the audience doing that kind of thing

1892
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,272
Consuming is best for them just

1893
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
To move on

1894
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Yeah it's almost imagine that he was

1895
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Great but

1896
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,440
Now he's turned back

1897
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
It's almost like

1898
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
If you know

1899
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:07,168
Say he was saying one thing and then Alex said something completely different later you might think

1900
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
Oh

1901
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,800
Trump give Alex a lot of money in order to say I'm not saying he did

1902
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,568
But those are the

1903
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,384
The questions that you would have to ask if somebody's opinion

1904
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Change so drastically

1905
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,456
At your image of them James

1906
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
Along with

1907
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,296
You're just giving him the the Kushner

1908
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,368
The Alex's series

1909
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,904
So Alex is Donald Trump

1910
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928
But again we'll see

1911
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:29,952
We'll see about that

1912
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
But you've done

1913
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,256
Trump for the moment

1914
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,560
I just got to get back to talking about that headline

1915
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,840
About the generals

1916
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,632
We're trying to avert a civil war

1917
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:47,616
No

1918
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,760
General

1919
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,136
2024 election

1920
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,928
I think that Clippers really telling

1921
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
Alex believes that if you're

1922
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:07,584
Conscious you can read a headline and then see what's really going on and read the secret messages behind

1923
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,632
You don't need to read the article at

1924
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:14,496
Self I guess which is really what I would consider the bare minimum a person needs to do to understand what an article

1925
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Call says bud

1926
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,800
I don't know baby I'm not conscious

1927
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:21,664
Alex seems to have the same relationship with all news that most people do with the onion

1928
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,224
The headline is what's important of the body of the text

1929
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,992
Maybe it's just

1930
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Belair

1931
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:30,112
If you start to understand that this is how his process works you'll start to understand how Alex

1932
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,648
Abuses primary sources

1933
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,696
It just makes up whatever stories he want

1934
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:37,024
Launch then points to headlines that secretly backup is made up stories

1935
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,328
And you can see it all if you were just conch

1936
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,888
To read between the lines

1937
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Now

1938
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,448
What I find even more

1939
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,240
Thing is that why you were gone

1940
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,520
I was listening back to bunch

1941
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,056
To those old files that I

1942
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
Found from 1998 over the past week

1943
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,896
I stumbled across this

1944
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,200
This is from his June 30th show

1945
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,736
In 1998

1946
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
I'd like to hear

1947
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,808
Some people have never called this

1948
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,136
And you can call if you call before that

1949
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:03,904
That's fine

1950
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,184
Bajoran people that have just

1951
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
People

1952
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,560
4 years ago on your TV show

1953
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
Stop lines are always busy

1954
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Sunday night tonight

1955
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
A new caller

1956
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,192
The call-in also you have any news stories

1957
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,496
You like to just read the headlines from

1958
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
And give

1959
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,592
Give me in the public out there your interpretation

1960
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
What you think

1961
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
Think what the media

1962
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
Pushing

1963
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,272
This is always been with Alex does

1964
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:33,856
I need does it because it's the only way to market the bulshit he sells his news

1965
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:38,208
Because they think the things he says are based in research

1966
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,488
They need to realize

1967
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,768
But they're accepting is fact

1968
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:44,608
The improvised ramblings that come out of Alex's imagination when he reads ahead

1969
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,192
This is all this s*** is and it's been that way for his whole f***

1970
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Yeah

1971
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,008
What do you think

1972
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:54,336
This is a hummingbird's that's an entertaining radio show

1973
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,408
When the when the not this one

1974
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,504
But that that kind of dynamic where the host calls in and ask her if

1975
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,528
Opinions from people

1976
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
And then they just banned him about and it's

1977
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,648
It's not good when the host

1978
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:10,464
Is the one doing that and then forcing you to agree with

1979
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,024
I think there's a difference

1980
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,864
Between expressing something strictly as an opinion

1981
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
And relating with news stories

1982
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,752
Tell me what you think it means

1983
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:28,128
Yeah what do you think the man is pushing with this headline what's secret what secret

1984
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:32,480
Can we find in this headline what code is in there right then there's an even bigger difference

1985
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:38,880
Between tell me what you think it means and I'm going to tell you what it actually means that if you disagree with me you're all good

1986
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:45,280
You're just an idiot

1987
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,304
Headline

1988
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Completely

1989
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,912
Different story from the body of the article

1990
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,960
It's too long

1991
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,240
You're too dumb to do

1992
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Is not read

1993
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,568
To look

1994
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
Alex is suing the government

1995
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,664
He's going to win one of his lawyers ignore Patty

1996

To the right of self-defense

2004

To the right to elect your own local

2005
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,776

People take the money cuz they're not even

2010
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
Thinking about whether it's a payoff

2011
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
Flashlight

2012
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,024
Their fellow citizens because they believed

2013
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
Winner movie

2014
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,352
Establishment

2015
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,448
They get to go to the conferences in the meeting and they get patted on the head

2016
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
4050 years

2017
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,336
America

2018
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:05,152
While you were being the Lemmings and the quislings

2019
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
And the traders in the sellouts in the suckers

2020
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
I'm a double agent

2021
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,320
Now you're coming down to the end of The Wire

2022
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,392
Now you're coming down to the

2023
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,416
Final point

2024
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
With a collab

2025
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
That's where we are

2026
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,960
Patterson

2027
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:32,288

2030
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,296
Okay

2031
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
I just realized

2032
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
30 minutes

2033
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
We're done

2034
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
Total incompetence

2035
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
Society

2036
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,872
Charlie

2037
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,664
Norwood

2038
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
Busy

2039
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:16,832
Working for me most likely right I waited wait half an hour while I rambled about nut

2040
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:25,280
Yeah he's gone

2041
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
I was just such an incompetent

2042
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,888
Listen to All of society I will tell you that there's something

2043
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
So much fun

2044
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
Near to me about the

2045
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,264
Then him yelling

2046
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,408
What are we doing

2047
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,456
What is anybody doing here

2048
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:49,088
Close to a moment of him being like guys I've been lying to you for 20 years I don't understand what you guys are doing listening to me anymore

2049
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,880
We're done we're done we're just done

2050
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:03,936
The buildup of the government is one of the greatest constitutional lawyer

2051
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
He's not there

2052
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,640
He's not coming over

2053
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,200
Deflation

2054
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,992
Yep just such a

2055
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,784
A company director

2056
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,416
Record scratch there should have been a moment there or like a whoopee cushion

2057
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,280
Planning for the last half-hour of the show

2058
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
To be an interview

2059
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,632
About his lawsuit

2060
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:37,984
Norm's not there

2061
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:41,312
So it's just talking extemporaneously

2062
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:45,664
I would say he's having a rough time with me

2063
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,224
I don't care about Trump

2064
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,608
Get ready for this tells you need Vitamin D3

2065
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,888
What a devil

2066
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
What I need

2067
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:18,688
Okay

2068
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
What

2069
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
Carabiner

2070
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,840
What is it you want

2071
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,864
Are you

2072
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,400
Why are you being nice to me

2073
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,032
Their mother put them in her crib today

2074
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,360
Lives in a crib watching TV

2075
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:51,200
That's why they can't believe there's people like me

2076
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,992
That I got all the milk I wanted

2077
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,528
I own the love I want

2078
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:05,536
Wow swab needs to kill everybody cuz the public

2079
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
Is scum

2080
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,656
Who's the worst kill dojo

2081
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:15,520
He'll be clawed back down into the

2082
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,640
I do think that it

2083
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,712
It's interesting that in the past we found clips

2084
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:28,832
Of him talking about his mom kicked him off

2085
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:31,648
I heard that you're a mama's boy

2086
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:34,464
Be strong my love no more

2087
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
Something

2088
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
Yeah that seems to run count

2089
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
Turn to that but

2090
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
If people are other people he wanted

2091
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:51,360
Your house up with gas in your face for an hour by your family

2092
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,664
Yeah it's true but that's chivalrous

2093
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
Yeah I was just so

2094
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
So much

2095
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
Is there

2096
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,784
To really sit back and

2097
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,064
Enjoy you know

2098
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,880
Just the feeling of a man who's been slighted

2099
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:09,536
In a minor ways all of humanity is scum I got to die

2100
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,072
Over

2101
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,888
The question of if if you if I'm a person

2102
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:19,264
Who would I make a big dinner for somebody they have to ask me afterwards why are you being nice to me

2103
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,080
That doesn't suggest to me that they want something for me

2104
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:28,480
That suggests that maybe I'm a complete assholes 99% of the time at least suspicious

2105
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,296
Talking about Rob Jacobson

2106
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:35,648
Cuz he's told that story of having Rob Jacobson over for dinner

2107
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
I'm being weird or something like that

2108
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:41,536
In the past I think it's just like a a retelling of that

2109
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,840
Details on

2110
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:48,448
I think it's interesting this what happens when there's a little flight

2111
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:52,800
I mean I could see him taking that hard

2112
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,592
There's also just like

2113
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:59,712
This wouldn't be happening if Norma dancers

2114
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:05,088
That is what would happen they'll relay delivery cost

2115
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:08,672
Bizarre world

2116
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
Where everyone's going to die I may have to die. Rob is a right that everyone stomach because they didn't get nothing

2117
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,400
Breast milk and

2118
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,704
Howard how are you throwing

2119
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,288
Giant shity tantrum on air and we're the skunk

2120
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:28,896
I think it's because the Dems of people on the left

2121
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,200
They get sexually excited

2122
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:37,600
By vaccinating their children because they know that they're going to die

2123
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,416
Piece of garbage

2124
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,696
Call Schwab

2125
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,280
He's ruling us

2126
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,328
Gaming us and scamming us

2127
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,632
And we decide spiritually

2128
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:53,472
Listen to what he's doing

2129
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
Acima

2130
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,176
Sacrificing my child is this

2131
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:09,856
I did 20 months ago and 10 months ago and six months ago in a month

2132
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,352
Thank you for being Heroes

2133
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,168
Take your shot

2134
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,520
Because there's too many people

2135
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:30,080
Thank you for having the courage to sterilize yourself

2136
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,384
And give herself heart attacks and yeah

2137
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
Your children come from you at The Fugitive in children

2138
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,480
They're trash.

2139
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:43,392
Call the Nazis had to hurt people in and shoot on the back of that develops to your own children

01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,720
Thank you for your courage realize your trash

2141
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,280
Thank you for realizing your subhuman garbage

2142
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,072
Warriors

2143
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,400
Yourselves

2144
01:48:54,656 --> 01:49:00,800
Carrier self I could see why you needed to apologize

2145
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,640
This is getting to be a little but

2146
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:08,224
Actually ever if I had when I got I got my shot

2147
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
If there was just

2148
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:15,648
Two big lines of conservative weirdos sarcastic clapping as I walk in

2149
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,072
I think for once

2150
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
The kind of track

2151
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:27,424
The character that Alex is doing that kind of

2152
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,984
Progress

2153
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,264
That it start

2154
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
With

2155
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,824
Benign

2156
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,176
Applauding of the people for getting the vaccine right and then it takes the narrative twists

2157
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Into

2158
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,784
You are murdering exactly

2159
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,160
Sarcastic escalation typically does not

2160
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:52,256
Go from A to B to C correctly

2161
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:57,120
To apologize for

2162
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:03,008
Oh you're so smart for getting the vaccine and that's why communism is coming over and you're like no no that's not how you do the Batman

2163
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:05,056
Now this is this works

2164
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:09,920
Android Beam on the left the thing is they don't actually even want their kids

2165
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,224
Like their kids

2166
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,248
Mental Health

2167
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
You're a hero

2168
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,416
And give them to your baby come and get attention when they're going to call

2169
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:27,328
Everybody will feel sorry for that your child you want to get off on the attention you get when they died

2170
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:31,424
Uncle God you're so good it's so much Bill Gates

2171
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,080
Southie said I can't have my

2172
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,128
Family over there on injected

2173
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,688
I agree with

2174
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
Stout

2175
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
Disgust

2176
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:49,600
Things stuff like all of this has better than a little bit

2177
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:53,184
Stone ocean

2178
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,464
People on the left

2179
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:57,536
Who would be getting their children vaccinated

2180
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:00,352
Don't love their children I just want the attention

2181
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,376
From there.

2182
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
That's f***** up

2183
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:07,520
He's acting as that Catalyst that every

2184
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,544
Genocide needs

2185
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,104
Of the person who convinces you that

2186
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:16,224
Despite everything you've ever known about every human being you've ever met having very similar thoughts

2187
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,504
10 goals and hopes

2188
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,344
Joy's in love's in all that stuff one group of people

2189
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,136
Is subhuman

2190
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:27,488
Absolute garbage and that nothing you do to them matters because

2191
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:30,816
They don't even love their own kids so what they don't even care what

2192
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
Happens to them

2193
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,608
They just want the attack

2194
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
Just want the attempt

2195
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,424
It's really

2196
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,960
Bizarre

2197
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Says about

2198
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
His

2199
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:45,664
I'm not going not saying that he just wants attention from his kids dying

2200
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,456
He went to just come up with that

2201
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,272
Is a very bizarre place for your mind to go

2202
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,808
And I know I wonder

2203
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,856
I wonder how that

2204
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,624
Thought

2205
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,392
Comes in

2206
01:51:55,648 --> 01:52:01,792
And that is is just like let's go with it I know I've never I've never thought

2207
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,816
Anyone

2208
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,864
You guys only had tubes

2209
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:09,984
The most inconvenient thing for you possible sure pretty expensive dangerous

2210
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,776
If you wanted my attention

2211
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,312
That makes sense

2212
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,848
I don't think that if you would be

2213
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,128
If I was a producer

2214
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,712
A little bit before this I would have called bark

2215
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:24,064
Cigar bars in here somebody

2216
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,368
There's a dark

2217
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:33,024
8 ft long candy cane and grab them by the neck

2218
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,608
You could do is get a like a cardboard cutout of norm pattis

2219
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,448
Hide behind it

2220
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:47,104
Hey Alex it's me Norm I'm here to talk to you

2221
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:51,968
Also Factory didn't say that you couldn't hang out with your family unless they've been vaccinated

2222
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:56,576
In fact he said that large Gatherings word even safe for people who had gotten the booth

2223
01:52:57,344 --> 01:53:03,488
He said that if your family was fully vaccinated getting together in a smaller group is pretty safe but that if you're not

2224
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
Even that kind of smaller Gathering

2225
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,304
Could be risky

2226
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:11,424
He didn't say you couldn't do it just at the choice to do so came with a much higher risk of getting infected and possibly inside

2227
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
Checking your family members

2228
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,008
I don't know I don't think he's

2229
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:18,336
Don't think you said anything that rebate

2230
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,896
Whatever be careful

2231
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,688
The worst thing you can say

2232
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,296
Inside a day

2233
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:35,488
And he only came in like right before the 3rd hours started

2234
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:40,096
He did stay in the fourth hour for this one thank God for that

2235
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,376
Just between

2236
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,704
The aftermath of missing Spider-Man

2237
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,520
Ropes betrayal

2238
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,592
Norm's phone not working

2239
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,616
Forsyth Tech

2240
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:56,480
This is just he's bad it's bad never ceases to amaze me

2241
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,272
That we can be talking

2242
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,576
Think about how the entire human race is scum

2243
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:03,136
But it's important to remember that a big part of that is

2244
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,696
Is Jay Jonah Jameson is not a flattering portrait

2245
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,048
You could do worse

2246
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:16,448
Even if j.k. Simmons play me is an a****** what you would be like hell yeah j.k. Simmons

2247
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:21,056
I less flattering comparison is that guy from

2248
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,200
Elizabeth Australia

2249
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,272
And at the end of the show he has some choice

2250
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:34,112
Take your injections

2251
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,416
It's so

2252
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,256
Be better tomorrow

2253
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:47,936
Location

2254
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,824
But you know it's okay

2255
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
The temperature

2256
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,688
Cuz you don't want

2257
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
According to them

2258
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,168
We

2259
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,728
Her courage great work she's doing

2260
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,776
Yeah

2261
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,640
Prodigy.com

2262
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:35,040
Legitimately just can't imagine being a person they show realize that Alex showed up an hour and 40 minutes late to his job

2263
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:40,416
And then proceeded to knock into any real news of substance at least partially due to his emotional reaction

2264
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,952
Hearing Trump endorse a booster

2265
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:45,280
Rashad a good place to throw your financial support

2266
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:48,864
Like what about this contact the contact looks like it's a good in

2267
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,632
Investment

2268
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,912
Song

2269
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:54,240
I was told that I am also scum

2270
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,056
I do deserve death

2271
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,872
And Society is pointless and useless right

2272
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,896
I would not think

2273
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
This guy

2274
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,992
Better keep saying that to people otherwise bad

2275
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,272
Things will happen

2276
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,552
Energy right now but I

2277
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:10,880
Would be too hard to make a solid argument

2278
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,672
Ethically wrong

2279
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,952
To give Alex money

2280
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,280
Right now by his product

2281
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,584
You could make that argument

2282
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,632
Alcoholic

2283
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:25,984
Alcoholic bottle of whiskey everyday Bay like man

2284
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,336
It's a good thing I'm supporting you cuz otherwise no one would buy you this booze anymore

2285
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,360
Yeah yeah

2286
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Pills

2287
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:37,504
More achy than normal go home and calm down

2288
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,040
Go to you know

2289
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:45,440
People used to go to the Arizona to loosen up their breath or whatever cuz they have tuberculosis

2290
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,000
I believe I'm in Arizona

2291
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:55,936
Good. Go hang out with our pilot

2292
01:56:56,192 --> 01:57:00,544
Animals twice a day exercise

2293
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,336
Nobody allows them to eat sugar

2294
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:07,200
I haven't heard him talk about going to Barton Springs and like the

2295
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:07,968
The hot

2296
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:11,552
Bob ABS or whatever it worth globalist show up

01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,368
Play Lisa maybe baby is overdue

2298
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,904
Get to get a hot bath

2299
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:22,048
Yeah hot bath Manor

2300
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,608
Practice self care self care

2301
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:28,448
Open mike eagle has some advice for you okay

2302
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Dreadful

2303
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:34,080
The beginning of the episode there's just too much

2304
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:38,688
To get two in one episode 4 part 1

2305
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,504
I will be back tomorrow with part 2

2306
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,040
Your Man

2307
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
This was something

2308
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,880
Listening to this was

2309
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:50,208
I'm glad I'm glad that I followed my nose

2310
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,768
From the beginning

2311
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,328
But I do like what happened on the 20th

2312
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,376
It's almost you know

2313
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,192
We've been doing this for too long

2314
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:02,752
Because it is impossible for me

2315
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:05,312
Outside of the context of having been done

2316
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
Been doing

2317
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,104
Solvang

2318
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,384
Believe the B is real

2319
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,456
You don't like this if I was told this

2320
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:15,808
But you know at the beginning of our I don't know anything about Alex Jones

2321
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,368
You are learning everything about Alex Jones

2322
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:20,416
And you told me this happen

2323
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:25,536
Yeah I would say not a chance in the world would anyone allow that anywhere broadcast

2324
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:30,656
Anytime if we if we started the show this was our first episode like the eclipse

2325
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:33,728
I don't know I don't know what we would come along

2326
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,520
Healthy no

2327
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,568
I don't think the show would continue

2328
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:41,408
If we hadn't found it's time to pray in the first episode

2329
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,016
What is happening

2330
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,064
It is it is surreal

2331
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,088
Tickets

2332
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,880
To consider that like this is

2333
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,696
It's happened

2334
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,464
Bonkers

2335
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:58,304
You there's no context for this

2336
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:04,960
With it like I said no point in time in any school I've ever been in was anyone even aware that this was

2337
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,008
The only contacts

2338
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:10,080
Relieve it we can even understand it in Asia

2339
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:12,896
Like you said haven't listened to

2340
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
This familiarity with him

2341
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,016
Like and knowing there is no boss

2342
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:20,320
His show is a psychodrama

2343
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:24,416
It's all just as petulant outburst

2344
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,720
Things get worse and worse

2345
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:29,024
His ability to do his job

2346
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,840
Gets thinner and thinner

2347
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,424
Under a lot of snow

2348
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,472
I'm not saying that it's not

2349
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:40,288
Understandable that you would have emotional outbursts

2350
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,336
If I was going to be sued into Oblivion

2351
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,664
And I was going to be brought in front of a congressional committee

2352
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,968
Regarding an Insurrection that I sure had something

2353
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
