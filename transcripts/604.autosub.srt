00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,464
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Fix-It around the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex G

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Nordam

7
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Damn

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
What's up what's your rights

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot today is I was able to partake in

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Over the weekend cuz I was invited over to Friend of the show Friends of the show

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
Shockey's house I got an invite to go over and watch the gcw

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:33,184
Game Changer wrestling pay-per-view

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
Gabe's vs. Jon Moxley in a deathmatch

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
Which is definitely not

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
My thing

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
You don't like that matches are they like real bloody

17
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
To believe they're good

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
But this whole thing is like

19
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,552
Understand this fully until kind of like watching this matching

20
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
The pieces together it's basically like with deathmatches it's like alright

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
There's some glass over here

22
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
I'm going to throw you through that

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
Running there's a sharp thing over here you're going to throw me through that right

24
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
It's at that over and over again

25
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
It's very it's very weird I don't enjoy it

26
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Competitive

27
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,336
Running while innocent bystanders are carrying pain class

28
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Everywhere you go

29
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,480
Yeah it needs it was not it's not my thing I don't enjoy it in terms of

30
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,088
I'm not even the biggest fan of pro wrestling but when I am it's not that stuff

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Yeah there's a bit of blood

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
The hope that the rest of the pay-per-view is kind of like

33
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
Like I expected there to be more deathmatches that was like

34
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,704
Rose almost no blood or anything throughout the the whole proceedings were they good

35
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,568
Like the matches were good it was very in quality some of those all right

36
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
The audience was kind of weird I don't know they're a little bit

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
The low energy

38
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
Deathmatch itself here's my review

39
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Disappoint is underwhelming

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
Only one man should have left

41
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
It was disgusting like I would like they're bleeding around and it's like

42
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Why would you do that

43
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Hey I wasn't shocked

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
There was nothing like

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,424
Really exciting about it so the wrestler 20 years ago is great

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
But when you're doing these things

47
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,080
I know that you don't know who they are necessarily looking like Nick Gage ER

48
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Huge

49
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Names in

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:33,504
This sort of Arena two of them competing for the championship belt

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
Fixer High

52
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Like they need to deliver something that's like

53
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Wow someone died

54
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
See that I was very

55
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,304
I was very bored

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Engrossed

57
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,240
What are things that Nick gave does he cuts people with a pizza cutter

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
Circular pizza cutter that cuts their forehead

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
So Jon Moxley got a pizza cutter early in the match

60
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
And was cutting

61
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Nick Gates Right

62
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Right

63
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Don't

64
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Don't say those words and act like I'm supposed to act like that's fine

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
It was not a grown adult man we got a pizza cutter

66
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,423
Cinemax

67
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
All in good fun

68
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
For competition

69
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,103
Nick games did not bleed all that much

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,431
From the cuts right then later on in the match

71
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,295
Got the pizza cutter and was cutting Boxley and I noticed

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
But his technique was different and that he used his thumb

73
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
Noticing that during a death

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
That's how bored I have that's that's too much awareness

75
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,751
So anyway it's not for me but it was a fun time and it was really nice to see Marty and Sarah

76
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,847
I hope someday they invite me somewhere to

77
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
Anyway

78
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,247
I know that predisposed that evening

79
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Indisposed

80
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
But that's what makes

81
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
More fun whenever you complain about not getting an invite that you couldn't go to anyways everybody knows we're having a great time

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,607
I meant I'm an a****** in is

83
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
My partner and I

84
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,727
Celebrate her birthday at the casino

85
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
As we talked about earlier

86
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Mom it was

87
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Very fun sure lights

88
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Casino parts

89
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Terrible don't like them

90
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,063
There's a lot of slot machines and I don't understand them whatsoever so many of them

91
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
People just sitting there smoking

92
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,511
Bananas I'm walking over there and the Fate my favorite part that was there was a

93
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
There was a no smoking

94
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Which

95
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
It coming from Chicago I was like oh how quaint

96
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
Yeah there's a no-smoking area that's very small

97
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
And you go over there and you see

98
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Those are the saddest

99
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
Worst slot machines they have they're all from 1960

100
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,735
B5 they look like the cash registers from 1940s you know like that kind of thing

101
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
And it was so clear that they're just like

102
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
We can still do the

103
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,695
This here there's nowhere else we can do this right some man with a bone to pick

104
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Do you know what I mean

105
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
We can sit in

106
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,583
Smoke and drink really bad free cocktails

107
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Everywhere else we go

108
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,983
Everywhere else we go people who don't smoke or like you can smoke

109
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
Here though you go in the corner

110
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
That's such a bummer

111
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
The whole vibe of a casino's Obama

112
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,087
I was after you mentioned this on our life episode my buddy Burger who I used to go to the island

113
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Free casino website

114
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Message me and it reminded me of

115
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,255
Some things that we were talking it's like at the casinos really depressing but what's worse is

116
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
The dog track

117
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
We can't go to a do know you can't go to Nikki gibsontown I went along with him to the dog track

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
I remember

119
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
Sad remember

120
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
I remember how bad the dog track is and I don't remember s*** birthday go to the.

121
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
If you really want to plumb the depths of just human desperation

122
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,231
I want to go further down the rabbit hole

123
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
See how much our psyches can take

124
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Going to make us stronger

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
Yeah I think I was texting you incessantly because

126
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
I couldn't leave

127
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
Yeah so far away from Tampa

128
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
You couldn't go anywhere huh

129
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,711
Episode to go over we're going to be talking about October 5th 2020

00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527

I feel like that's plagiarism that's it that's the like we want to be free to do what we want to do speech

183
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
It was a little bit longer than most of our contacts drops but I felt like

184
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
It didn't belong in any Glyph of the episode 1 of make love

185
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
Capitalize design

186
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Play the second one

187
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
So

188
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
His wife could eat no lean because the

189
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Lick the platter clean

190
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
Yep

191
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
Accountability

192
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
Oh well hey you gotta move on

193
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
You just keep plowing through

194
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Yep

195
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Sprouts

196
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
Oh s*** I forgot the rest of it so I don't know I don't know if you want to make a choice or people listeners can tell us

197
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
Which is the better out of context drop

198
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
That's Tuff

199
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
I mean the first one

200
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Grocer

201
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Yeah

202
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Light rail

203
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,743
They're both appealing in different ways there in a certain death match of their own right

204
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Disappoint

205
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Yeah that's

206
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Restart on October 5th

207
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
Wow thank you so much for joining us on this live

208
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Tuesday October 5th

209
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,663
Petoskey advisor executive

210
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,551
On video admitting that they know that the vaccine is destroying people's immune system

211
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,159
And that it's a higher rate of people that are sick they're taking the vaccine

212
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
And it's causing a d e

213
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Dependent enhancement

214
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
It's a

215
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
And normally that would be a top story

216
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
But it's not

217
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
Is it because finally people are kind of gotten the idea that these guys are full of s*** all the time no cuz I was a bigger

218
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,063
Your Story by real quick on this project if you hear that name and you don't immediately like

219
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
Boo-boo either an idiot or convexo

220
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:50,047
So the video that they put out is largely about the idea that natural immunity is better than the immunity one would get

221
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
From vaccinations

222
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
This of course is a false Choice that's being presented where what option is getting vaccinated and the other is survival

223
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Covid

224
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
This conveniently ignores a whole lot of variables like the possibility of dying or having

225
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Severe complications from getting covid

226
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
These things aren't factored in

227
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
Because the video is arguing a stupid

228
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Fake point

229
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,415
There's no evidence of this video that drives our knows the vaccines are causing adee nor that they're wiping out immune system

230
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,047
There's one secretly recorded interview with a guy who's credited as a quote senior associate scientist

231
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
Who says that the rise in cases were seeing with a Delta variant is

232
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Is possibly attributable to addict

233
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
Priests efficacy of the vaccine overtime

234
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Or the immunity waning

235
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,151
This is being misrepresented by Alex to be this guy saying that over time the vaccine destroys your immune system when in reality

236
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
It's just him explaining that the

237
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
Protection you may have went from 95% to 70% affect

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,879
Is a person having a loose conversation not someone who's citing hard information

239
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
So I don't know how much I would Bank on even

240
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
In the specifics of

241
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
It sounds like they finally got them

242
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Nailed to the wall

243
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
Allow the rest of the video is talking about Pfizer profiting from the vaccine and if that's a conversation to Veritas

244
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
I welcome that conversation

245
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Let's go ahead and nationalize production and distribution of the necessary medical breakthroughs that happened

246
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Suspicion about profit motives

247
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,295
It just goes away I mean considering the fact that these are financed with federal funds I eat our money

248
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
How is it that then Vega to make money off of

249
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
The things that were paid for them to pick her up

250
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
Welcome Veritas championing that position but because they're not actually concerned if eyes are profiting off exit

251
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
Didn't want to use that fact that they do make a profit as a prop

252
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
2 attack actual vaccine

253
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
All in all this video is lousy with fake argue

254
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Project Veritas 11 with itself

255
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
Essentially meaningless

256
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
Regret that I watch

257
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Such a waste of time I can't believe you did

258
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
I'm proud of you

259
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
We got a knothead

260
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
I know that I say every time that a project Veritas thing happens like where this is the last time I'm looking

261
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,887
Daddy. It's for you

262
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
Nobody else believes them anymore except for people who already believe this s*** that there's

263
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,823
Just justifying for them or the only person who goes in there

264
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Curious

265
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Wanting to fight

266
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,991
And every now and again I think they really do impress by lying in a new way that's

267
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
The creative new way

268
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
That's not the top story

269
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Rick is here

270
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Is the motherfuking top story

271
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
But that's our second biggest story

272
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Ladies and gentlemen

273
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
You saw you heard

274
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
Broadcast

275
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,591
Emergency Tuesday broadcast fauci talks about staging

276
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
Healthcare

277
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
With new virus

278
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
In 2019 video

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
Amazing crew ended up staying up here until

280
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Last night

281
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,095
To bring you an emergency Monday transmission and then believe me I didn't just come up here for fun if this is an emergency

282
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
How is today's broadcast

283
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
This confirms a premeditated

284
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Halcyon the video

285
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
With the head of

286
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
Health and Human Services

287
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,479
Virus out of China

288
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
The scary wanted to accepting the new mRNA technology

289
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
This is just a

290
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
Pathetic attempt on Alex's part to grasp at straws to build up and reinforce his covid

291
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Conspiracy

292
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
Even before I get into any of the details on this just take a moment to grasp

293
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
How stupid Alex is in what nonsense he expects this audience

294
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Except

295
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
Here he is saying about tree and other immune immune ology experts got together and discuss how they needed a new stars covid

296
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
The bird flu

297
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
In order to get people to accept vaccine

298
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
Does Alex know that coronavirus isn't influenza viruses are

299
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,135
Completely different he absolutely does not know that what you saying is gobbledygook

300
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Did Samantha it's magic

301
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
What's going on

302
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,559
In October 2019 he was part of a panel hosted by the Milton Inn

303
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Which was broadcast on C-Span

304
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,983
This was a discussion about the breakthroughs in science and technology that it made it conceivably possible

305
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Who created vaccine

306
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
That actually work

307
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,103
Universally against all strains of influenza

308
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:25,503
Most of the discussion is about the frustrating reality that there's a lack of funding and that that's a lack of motivation

309
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
Call the part of the industry to pursue this sort of thing

310
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Which makes sense and socks

311
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
There's literally no discussion of staging a pandemic this is

312
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Sweetly made-up

313
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
I was just make sure we get

314
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,095
To playing this clip any of it I mean it would save

315
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
He gets to playing

316
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Eclipse haha 50 minutes into the episode I was like where is the

317
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Furious that's banana

318
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,407
I'm going to play for you the clip of the panel that he calls the smoke

319
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Okay

320
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
This is heavily edited and a lot of things that sound suspicious make perfect sense

321
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
In the context of the talk

322
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
The only way for these

323
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,159
The dudes who have created this clip that we're about to listen to

324
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
Is to actively watch the panel and edited

325
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,583
Contacts there's no other explanation for this

326
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,679
9:52

327
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:21,055
I had to stay up late with my team editing this down into something we can lie about right

328
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Everyone can actually take quite a

329
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
While talking about

330
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,991
That's not cuz I think there is a valuable illustration that we can make

331
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
By going

332
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
To the source material

333
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
God comparing it

334
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,903
To the way that Alex present sounds great but here is the

335
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Combined clips

336
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Of the panel

337
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
Why don't we blow the system up

338
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
I mean obviously we can't just turn off the spigot

339
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
On the system we have

340
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
And then say hey everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we've been given to anyone yet

341
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
But there must be some way that

342
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
We grow back seems mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947

343
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Transition

344
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
From getting out of the

345
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
True

346
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Results

347
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Canby

348
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Beneficial

349
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
Just something has to be much better

350
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
And then you got to go through all of the

351
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,799
Clinical trials phase one's face-to-face tree and then show

352
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
This particular product

353
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
It's going to be good over a. Of years

354
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
If it works perfectly

355
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Is going to take a decade

356
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
There might be a need

357
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135
Or even an urgent call for

358
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
An entity

359
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Beholden to bureaucratic strings and an in Prophecy

360
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
Foreseeing influenza is going to be very difficult

361
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,031
Change that

362
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
Unless you

363
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
I'm okay with your perception is

364
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
Wheaton Woods arrest the problem in a disruptive

365
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Because she do need both

366
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
But it is not

367
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Too crazy to think that an outbreak of an novelabia virus could occur in in China

368
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,327
Somewhere

369
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Beeman to a number of regional centers if not local if not even in your home at 10

370
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
OnPoint

371
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
And France those vaccines on a pageant self-administer

372
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,919
So that's the entirety of the clips that he has got together from

373
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Right

374
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
How long has it been

375
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
45 minutes early maybe about 15 minutes

376
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Well they should have added it down to just that

377
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,695
Hell yeah memes like they didn't have anything else important to say no certainly not

378
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
We're going to go through this each clip by each

379
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Which clip that Alex put into this compilation

380
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Discuss the context

381
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Where they come from and what they're talkin about

382
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
So here's the first flipping out

383
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Why don't we blow the system up

384
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
I mean obviously we can't just turn off the spigot

385
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
On the system we have

386
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,295
And then say hey everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we've been given to anyone yet

387
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
But there must be some way that

388
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:19,488
We grow back seems mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
So this is the moderator of the discussion Michael Specter of the New Yorker

390
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,960
His question was very clearly about technological innovations in the Spear of vaccines

391
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,056
It was a prop that had to do with how this is not a space that is kept

392
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Pace

393
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
With other field

394
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Here is that clip in it

395
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
So it's part of my life

396
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
Do people use the

397
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Word

398
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Children Dollywood

399
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
I mostly

400
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
But I'm going to use it now just ruption

401
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Why don't we blow the system up

402
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
I mean obviously we can't

403
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Spigot on the

404
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
The system we have

405
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,960
And then say hey everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we've been given to anyone yet

406
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
But there must

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Be somewhere

408
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Grow back

409
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Axiom's mostly in

410
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
In eggs the way we did in 90

411
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
I mean we live in a world where I can download whatever

412
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Song I want

413
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Onto my phone

414
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Command

415
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
And we Grove.

416
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Maxine's the way we did

417
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
70 years ago

418
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
What is going on with

419
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
That

420
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
It's conversation is about disrupt

421
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,144
In the field of Technology

422
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Isolated portion of it that Alex played together and sounds like what they're really looking

423
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,104
4 is a catalyst to make everybody exactly

424
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Play so if there's not going to be one that

425
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
It's just going to happen naturally we'll make one

426
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
In order to blow up assist

427
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Shot it

428
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,160
So here's the second clip with Alex plays that first one of Michael Specter was from 8 minutes in

429
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,744
Yeah now the next clip is fauci from 22 minutes in

430
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,816
Pain order to make the transition

431
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
From getting out of the

432
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
True

433
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,240
Results

434
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Canby

435
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Beneficial

436
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
Does something have to be much better

437
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
And then you got to go through all of the

438
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:23,392
Clinical trials Phase 1 phase two space three and then show

439
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
This particular product

440
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
It's going to be good over a. Of years

441
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
If it works perfectly

442
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Is going to take a decade

443
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
This is actually kind of fair like it's I don't think it's

444
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
Really all that Miss representative

445
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
Talk to you was talking about how there were break Thursday

446
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,872
The scientists were making in terms of universal flu vaccine

447
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
But it would be something that would still take a long time

448
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,760
He's not talking about the time tables that would take to make

449
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,880
An mRNA coronavirus vaccine

450
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
It's a different conversation but like

451
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Sure

452
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
You saying it's something would take a long time

453
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Look up work Sprite and it's not like

454
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
I don't know if this is this is this

455
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,752
Close to like okay at least it's not like maliciously out of context

456
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,824
Wheatley like separate conversation

457
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
I mean the obvious thing about that though it's like

458
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,248
What they're also describing is not just a decade of like researching

459
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
In developmental all of that I wouldn't be

460
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
To surprise

461
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
As if they had something that they building around right now that is like

462
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,048
30% effective against most flu and it's like okay they can refine that and then

463
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Eventually it's going to have

464
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
How to get down to

465
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,704
Let's test it if we're going to give it to everybody where you have to test it on after

466
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
And this what yeah and that's a really good point

467
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,384
He also felt she is also discussing how this is on the shoulders of

468
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
This is research that's already in

469
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
In the process there's there's more to it

470
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
It's close

471
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
It's not nearly as bad as the rest of the

472
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Here is the

473
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Third clip

474
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Which are Alex's cut-in

475
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
This is from

476
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
32 minutes

477
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
So 10 minutes after that last

478
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
There might be a need

479
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
Or even an urgent call for

480
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
An entity

481
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
Beholden to bureaucratic strings and an in processing so that clip out of context makes no sense

482
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
You don't know what is he talking about

483
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
I mean I guess what he's trying to say is that the government is acting to slow our I guess what Alex is trying to make you think

484
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
He sang is that because the government can tax

485
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
The way that we want it

486
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
To right now then there needs to be an outside entity that is not

487
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
Beholding to all of those laws

488
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,168
The evil government that keeps them from doing stuff we need

489
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Satanism

490
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
Oh okay well here's the full contact

491
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
I'm I I think I'll

492
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Also

493
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
That is just a

494
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
I mean it probably hasn't been

495
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
For quite some time

496
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Tell me when I was in grad school everyone

497
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Hib vaccine

498
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
Ettore Harriet Robinson

499
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Where can I find nav

500
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
For Hy-Vee in

501
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
I came to the lab and

502
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Everyone's working

503
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,536
You can do whatever one else is doing I got a little bit of left

504
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Blue money

505
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
Lou Grant over there

506
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
And no one's in

507
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
What to do on that challenge

508
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
To make it sex

509
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
I think we have

510
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
To I like the

511
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Disrupting

512
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Field

513
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
If we are just

514
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Continually thinking we're going to

515
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Working on that

516
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
Another iteration or a

517
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Think we need to continue or doing but

518
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Another eight

519
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Fashion or another ass

520
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
SAR another step

521
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
I don't know if that's enough

522
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Recite those

523
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
Really creative thinkers

524
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
So in addition

525
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Into doing what we're doing worse

526
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
So good at

527
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
I think in parallel

528
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
There might be a need

529
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Or even

530
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
An urgent call for

531
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
An entity

532
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Out there that's completely

533
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Disruptive

534
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
That's not

535
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Beholden to

536
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
The bureaucratic

537
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Strings in

538
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
And processing

539
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
Well

540
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Galvanized

541
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Put a lot of

542
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
And I think that

543
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Easiest way to get

544
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
Grad student really excited

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
It's too early to put it down on it

546
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
A lot of money

547
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Yes you will know

548
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
There has been moved

549
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Certain members

550
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Congress Ed Markey

551
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Put a billion

552
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Increasing

553
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Influenza for univer

554
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
Where is the flu vaccine by a billion dollars

555
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
5 years

556
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Family Dollars

557
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Over it

558
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Year for five years

559
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
When you put that

560
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Investment you will get

561
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
People excited

562
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Not to do the

563
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
You'll get new people

564
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Come in with new ideas that artist

565
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Disruptive

566
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
And looking at it

567
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
So when you haven't

568
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Resources

569
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
That's how

570
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
With HIV

571
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,568
So predominantly what they're talkin about and it becomes pretty clear when you listen to the full answer

572
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,944
And they talked about it a bit more throughout to is there needs to be

573
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
Some kind of dedicated flu

574
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Entity

575
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
That has funding

576
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,648
For this new research

577
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
Because it when you have the money you attract

578
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,048
Creative thinkers who can attack the problem from other

579
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,864
Angles things you wouldn't think of the innovate

580
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
It's disruptive to the status quo of how

581
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,800
Treatment has been bottled up till this point

582
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
Nextdoor

583
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
It's obvious I mean he's

584
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Did that that

585
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
We need a changes

586
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
It when he's talking about his grad school

587
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,552
And all of those people doing one thing and it's like

588
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Oh

589
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
That makes perfect

590
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Obviously

591
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
It is not this guy trying to steal the powers

592
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
The government

593
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
Create a super virus that will wipe out Humanity

594
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
No

595
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
So it's not

596
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
It's not that okay

597
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
So here's the fourth Cliff this is fauci and this is from

598
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
42 minute

599
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,336
I can do that so we're jumping around 10 minutes

600
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,432
So we really do have a problem with how the world perceives

601
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,992
Influenza is going to be very difficult

602
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
The change that

603
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
Unless you

604
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Okay with your perception is

605
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
We can address the problem in a disruptive way

606
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
Because you do need both

607
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
So

608
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,680
What is out-of-context obviously

609
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,288
You know people don't take the flu seriously enough so we're going to make them take it seriously

610
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
We're going to teach them a real life

611
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
That's not what he was saying at all

612
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
It's the Diversey

613
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
City of what influence

614
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
To the community

615
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
For some people they get

616
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
The flute the real

617
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Not like

618
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
But the real flu

619
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
They get better

620
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
So this August

621
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Perception

622
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
If it's so serious

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
People get flu a

624
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
And it isn't it

625
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Catastrophe

626
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
When you dealing with the disease like HIV

627
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
To get HIV

628
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Serious

629
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Whether you're young

630
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
Whether you're middle-aged will

631
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
You're old

632
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
Cancel

633
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
That bad

634
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Whether you're young weather

635
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Intermediate

636
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Where is width

637
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Wednesday

638
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
For some people they go throughout life

639
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Active

640
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
There isn't anybody that's afraid of

641
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
You going to focus

642
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
Open you say are you afraid of getting HIV if you weren't with of

643
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
You afraid of getting cancer absolutely

644
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Are you afraid of

645
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
I mean

646
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
The reality

647
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
The flu

648
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Isaiah Isaiah

649
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
We're responsible

650
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Variety

651
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Diseases

652
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Macon County

653
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Is malaria

654
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Tuberculosis

655
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Zika Ebola

656
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
The middle of Ebola right now

657
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
So you go

658
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
The DRC

659
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
See where I was

660
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Went to a week and a half

661
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
And you getting somebody

662
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,112
You worried about influenza

663
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
When you talk

664
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Influenza

665
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
They don't

666
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,000
Influenza because I have enough problems

667
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
With malaria

668
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Tuberculosis

669
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Bowling

670
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
So what is it

671
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Perception

672
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Which is a myth

673
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Perception

674
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
That it is not a serious

675
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Disease

676
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
What is Casey

677
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
Hundreds of thousands

678
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
People diabetes

679
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Millions and millions

680
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
So we really do have a problem with how the world

681
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Influenza

682
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
And it's going to be very difficult

683
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Change that

684
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Unless you

685
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Within

686
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
I'm okay with your perception

687
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Wicked Witch

688
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
The problem is

689
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Disruptive

690
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Both so

691
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Essentially

692
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
If you take the entire context of the clip in

693
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Into consideration

694
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
What do you saying is that there's not going to be public pressure

695
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
Ever really to deal with this for the flu

696
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,944
Influenza vaccine

697
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,088
Possibly be something that could be created isn't going to come from people who are like I'm terrified of getting the flu

698
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
No one's calling their representative being like if you guys don't

699
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,232
Fund flu research right now

700
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:04,096
I'm so essentially we what he is is advocating is we need to do this from within

701
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
The people who are the researchers

702
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
Yeah I need to

703
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,776
Treat the problem as it is not as people perceive its right

704
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Right now makes total sense.

705
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
It's very obvious

706
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
That's not even it that's not even hard you could have just

707
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Hey

708
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Do people take the flu seriously

709
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
No is that bad

710
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Probably

711
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
DND

712
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Yeah I got it

713
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,976
What Alex is doing is taking selfies words and do the Magic Tree

714
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Basically

715
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,912
So here's the fifth clip which is the one that I strongly suspect is what made Alex cover this clip to begin

716
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
But it is not

717
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
Too crazy to think that an outbreak of an novelabia virus could occur in in China

718
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
Somewhere

719
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
FEMA to a number of regional centers if not local if not even in your home at 10

720
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
OnPoint

721
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
And Prince those vaccines on a pageant self-administer

722
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
That's a fascinating

723
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Lady about technology

724
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,168
That would be so cool but he mentioned China and vaccine vaccines and there you go

725
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
Anyway here's the full clip

726
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Adventure who

727
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
He thinks we are having

728
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Plane from

729
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
In Orange

730
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Clinton New York

731
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Deliverable

732
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
How

733
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
How far are we

734
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Far away but I don't

735
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Two crazy eyes

736
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Remove Tori

737
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Maxine

738
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Remove the

739
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Dependency

740
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
We can move into

741
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
That Niger

742
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Those sequins

743
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Shared

744
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Around the world

745
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
The small fry

746
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Kevin made

747
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
In a shoebox

748
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Is translatable

749
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
2A 3D

750
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Napa

751
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Those

752
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Analogies are

753
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
But it is

754
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Novelabia

755
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
We could get

756
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
Get the rnase

757
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
Vmat2

758
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Number of

759
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Local if

760
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Your home at 10

761
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Where Waze

762
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Adapted

763
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
That doesn't mean it doesn't prove s***

764
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,520
It's it's just the weakest bombshell I've seen him try to pass off

765
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,824
Like you hear that and it's like though they're discussing

766
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
Hypothetical

767
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,992
I need to make this very fully clear

768
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
Very specifically in the context

769
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Text of

770
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Universal flute

771
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
The entirety of it is nothing to do

772
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
With a coronavirus the way that Alex's

773
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
Nothing nothing

774
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,704
And am nothing matches like the idea that they were planning something

775
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,032
Outbreak

776
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
To pick this new technology

777
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
They're discussing

778
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
New technology

779
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,456
I I swear to you

780
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
I cannot believe

781
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
That you can't sell

782
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
People on

783
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
This

784
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Okay

785
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Take

786
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
10 billion dollars away from the military

787
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
They won't even f****** notice

788
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
They don't have an accounting process

789
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
Apparently.

790
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Towards

791
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,448
Making Universal flu vaccine printers

792
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,496
That you can have in your house

793
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Incredible

794
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
Yeah I would have a problem with that

795
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Everybody everybody

796
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,272
But more importantly the only people who have a problem with it now or

797
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
Big corporations who can't

798
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
That sell that probably

799
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,696
What does insulin think is really fascinating is that I watch

800
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
This whole

801
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Presentation this whole panel

802
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
And it's the stuff that was very intentionally ignored

803
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
There's one comment that sink

804
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,264
Ratably bizarre that they left out considering they cut out clips from before and after this

805
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
In the panel.

806
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
Discussion I wonder why they didn't include this

807
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,200
Anywhere in this room were probably vaccinologist were probably immunologist

808
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,296
Preferably working on some vaccine made some back pain at some point in our life it

809
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:16,160
We're not the chemical Engineers are the other Engineers are they Anthropologist or others

810
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
To bring

811
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Critical insight

812
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
And how you disrupt and deconstruct

813
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,376
A nasal problem and we've had these vaccines for 70 years

814
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
So this is an age-old

815
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Contract

816
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
That requires those creative shaft that come out the

817
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Kitchen deconstruct the carrot cake

818
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
I can make it look like

819
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
Play something different

820
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
The best care

821
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Take your battery in your entire life

822
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
We need that for the influenza

823
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Vaccine

824
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
And we also need to not forget

825
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
That poor influenza

826
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,856
Vaccines are the only part

827
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Solution

828
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,720
I mean it's so easy to get caught up if you want to get sexy influenza

829
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
You do stay in the back seat space

830
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:57,888
But if you go into the diagnostic space for the therapeutic station non-pharmaceutical interventions

831
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
Those are the early steps

832
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:05,056
That will make a huge impact on Benny that epidemic her proceed no and a pandemic outbreak

833
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
That's why you have to have that

834
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Single

835
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
Focus and today

836
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
Focus on stopping influenza

837
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Not only on

838
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Making us

839
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
That's weird

840
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,904
So you're saying that they don't necessarily want to only make a vac

841
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Maxine

842
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
They want to use multi

843
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Triple treatment

844
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
It's almost like they're Public Health

845
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
Professionals and experts who are discussing ways of treating a problem dealing with the problem as opposed to what

846
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Alex is presented as

847
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
Which is they want to just put dabs in everybody

848
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,592
It is ironic that he is describing

849
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
The antithesis to Ali

850
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
You know that like

851
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,320
The the creative Chef who can come in and turn an amazing carrot cake into something that you don't think of the carrot cake

852
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,880
And you can eat deliciously without being like scared

853
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
Alex

854
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,488
Is the person who takes an amazing carrot cake

855
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
That won't get you f******

856
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
Killed by a virus and then goes

857
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
It's going to

858
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Kill you

859
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Truth it's the same job

860
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
Yeah

861
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:11,360
So I I want I watch this I saw the eclipse that Alex

862
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Just just

863
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Weakest attempt

864
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,968
I've seen to make a bombshell out of something

865
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,064
Does not get a degrade no I don't think that this to stay till 8

866
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
To get this kind of work done cuz this sucks

867
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Yeah

868
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976
I think that the I also enjoyed watching

869
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Show presentation

870
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,608
So I appreciate Alex bringing that to my attention nice

871
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
But this is

872
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
Where are The Smoking Gun

873
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,544
Call Smokin gun absorb for me yes

874
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
Is the Smoking Gun of all smoking guns

875
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,688
Smoking guns Hoboken gods and when you add it to

876
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,016
Wuhan lab and fauci Indian

877
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Function for viruses

878
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,488
Which is the covid-19 virus it is Joya

879
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,048
Unbelievable

880
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
Open and shut

881
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,192
Let me know if it's a smoking got a Smokin Guns of Smoking Gun what am I

882
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
The editor too hard

883
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
And then there's also a question

884
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
Do you need all of these other

885
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Narrative

886
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,480
Combine all of it together for to be even

887
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,832
Marginally persuasive invisible Smoking Gun is smoking guns

888
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,184
Stupid it does seem though that if that is the Smoking Gun it Smoking Gun

889
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
And then we can at least be sure he's only going

890
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,376
Going to talk about that narrative from here on out because that's the one I mean it's got to be the most important be the only important

891
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,984
Yeah you probably take most of the you know the Restless episodes

892
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Of the segment

893
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:48,128
Well I mean you just talked about it for a little while actually completely agree with

894
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,504
If this is the smoking guy need to be talked about it all day it's the only important

895
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,856
You should hear the 3-hour so he could play the entire thing

896
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,416
I still have 2 hours left

897
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Obey Smoking Gun

898
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,536
Is that you no longer need evidence past

899
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
The gunman smoke it's cuz it's smoked

900
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
It's smoking did you shot something

901
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Someone

902
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:17,568
There's a there's a there's nobody was like okay but now let's go find out where is shoes came from

903
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
Yeah we got it

904
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,480
We've got the Smoking Gun open-and-shut case

905
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,440
Look we make money on clothes for the cops

906
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:38,048
God so Alex Alex believes that not only did talk to do this

907
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
There was a specific

908
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,680
Okay and Alex know it's the countries that Alex thinks are white

909
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,472
Primary targets

910
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
Australia New Zealand Canada Europe

911
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
UK the US

912
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,407
We have a background of free-market and right to self-defense

913
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Christianity

914
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
Bears against the system

915
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,599
Abortion and Satanism

916
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
Multiculturalism

917
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,279
Bio-weapon no one else is taking

918
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
That's just not true

919
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,167
You just make a slippery slope argument that the first look

920
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
If you force people

921
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
To recognize that race is a f****** social contract and has nothing to do and we're all just the same people all the time

922
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
What's next

923
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Bioweapons

924
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Probably

925
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
So the message that Alex is trying to send is that the MRNA vaccines are a weapon and they're being deployed against the country that he sees as Christian and

926
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
That's what's up

927
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Text hear it

928
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
It's very cool

929
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
This is all just a zonolite persecution complex talking though since countries all over the world of authorized views of both the Pfizer

930
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,143
When you get right down to it it's really just about money

931
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,799
Very few countries have the ability to actually manufacture mRNA vaccines and companies that do aren't sharing that she

932
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Because it would cut into their profits

933
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,199
The lower-income countries can't afford to buy large amounts of these vaccines for their population

934
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
Mako with less effective but more affordable alternative

935
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,879
Or maybe just not able to vaccinate the vast majority of the public have

936
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:12,767
Anyway this is a load of bulshit the only real message Alex is trying to spread here is that white people are under attack because that's

937
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
The theme of the show

938
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
Yeah it's a lot faster than I was

939
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
Expecting I didn't I didn't I didn't go faster than I expected

940
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
That that I understand I meant more in the contacts

941
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
The sentencing

942
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
We're talking about bioweapons

943
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,223
It's all about bio-weapons their child

944
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Multiculturalism wait what

945
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
It's now it's race

946
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Stated about

947
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
So

948
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Talk to use on this

949
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Packing tape

950
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,255
2019

951
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Smoking Gun bragging

952
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Dab

953
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
I didn't hear that

954
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
That's

955
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
Do you know why he did that

956
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
That's what villains in movies

957
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
Why do villains in movies do it

958
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,967
Because they're based off of people like fauci

959
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
Jared Anthony Criminal

960
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Hiding in plain view

961
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
Remember

962
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,143
Movies with villains or sci-fi films are dystopic known

963
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,727
Does the villain brag about what they do

964
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
They love to monologue

965
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
What they're planning very thinly veiled

966
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
In front of you

967
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
Before they do it

968
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
Just like the Riddler or the Joker will

969
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
Breaking on TV or radio

970
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
Tell you he's sending you a tree

971
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Come knocking in the night

972
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
In the form of

973
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
So that it makes it more fun like the Zodiac Killer bragging in movies is done as an easy way

974
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,567
Need to fill in gaps in the plot with big

975
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
Exposition

976
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,431
That's what it is that's typically the narrative

977
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,271
A function of its the movie telling you what the movie did

978
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,319
Yeah it's also really convenient

979
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:17,183
Because it gives the right away to create a situation where the hero is dead to rights on the villain is all but one

980
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
But because of hubris the heroes able to wiggle out of the situation at

981
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,303
Classic U-verse is croosh

982
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
The Riddler sent out riddles because I was his whole character

983
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
Obsessed with puzzles inside of the Batman was the best person to test his abilities again

984
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
There's not a good choice

985
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
The Riddler actually worked for Bruce Wayne until Bruce Wayne neglected him or he had an accident or something and then riddles

986
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Everywhere I look there's a lot of different versions of characters

987
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
But he's

988
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,671
He gives out riddles cuz he's the riddle

989
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,255
That's where the Joker he's criminally insane there was that

990
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
There was that

991
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,887
But Alex thinks he's living in a spy movie so it's

992
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447
To come as no surprise that he imagines his pretend filling

993
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,007
Are taunting him like a bondability yeah

994
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,871
It's just really sad to see the likes he has to go to create the impression that they're actually doing that though

995
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
This bombshell today is a

996
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
Particularly weak example of that

997
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,527
Lucy's people taunting him at all corners

998
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Yeah it does feel like it you do it

999
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
Movies are realer than the reality you see

1000
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
You know like him

1001
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Cuz it exactly in real life

1002
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
You don't monologue

1003
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Because that would

1004
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Waste time

1005
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,191
I mean they f******

1006
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,847
You know like that they didn't f****** monologue you know be an interesting is if you are a villain

1007
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,175
And you're about to commit your crime monologue and then you're like

1008
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,015
Didn't feel as good as I thought it would do that one again

1009
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
You know what I thought

1010
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
That would really be exciting Piazza monologue my crime out cuz normally I don't do it that only hope

1011
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
Really step into those shoes hold

1012
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
And you know what I just

1013
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
Left me cold I don't feel I don't feel real bummer

1014
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:07,775
It's a real bummer it's like meeting your Heroes you know who perform a monologue in a

1015
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
On my lock situation

1016
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:15,199
Or maybe that's a sign that you need to like checking in on if you're depressed

1017
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
It doesn't feel good maybe you don't know the things that you would imagine that

1018
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,159
Play commercials or whatever

1019
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
These days

1020
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Yeah

1021
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
I do think it's really silly

1022
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Nathan Alex beliefs

1023
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
But that is bananas

1024
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,215
Yep Alex believes that are actually much more f***** up

1025
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Open dangerous though

1026
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
8:15

1027
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
1815

1028
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
The Battle of Waterloo

1029
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
Wellington defeated

1030
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Is British

1031
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
Polian Bonaparte

1032
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
Carrier pigeons the coast

1033
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
I'm fast

1034
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Corvette ships across to announce that morning

1035
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
For Wellington and lost a war

1036
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,119
The British stock market plunge by 99%

1037
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,727
Rothschild of course again

1038
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
Then they came in with the news oh my God

1039
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,591
Wellington has lost British Army destroyed

1040
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,687
British Empire collapse Napoleon rules the Earth

1041
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
Hahaha

1042
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Hundred

1043
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Plus years later

1044
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
System rule the entire

1045
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Planet

1046
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
Russia and a few other countries

1047
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Wow

1048
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
So we talked about this in depth

1049
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
In the end game coverage

1050
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,079
Brief refreshers that story that Alex is telling about Nathan Rothschild is not

1051
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
True

1052
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,967
It has its roots in a pamphlet that was distributed by a giant anti-semite whose pen name was Satan

1053
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
But I was actually named George.

1054
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,951
Write the pamphlet released in France was titled the edifying and curious history of Rothschild the first king of the

1055
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Jews

1056
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
From that point forward the story became a piece of anti-Semitic Allure passed down through generations of people who swear they don't actually a Jewish B

1057
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,031
The story would be dramatized in the 1940 Nazi propaganda film the Rothschilds shares in Waterloo

1058
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
To put it bluntly Alex either thinks this fake story is true or he knows it's a lie that's been historically used to incite public hatred of

1059
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Jewish people

1060
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,783
Passing it along to his audience as the truth anyway

1061
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,599
I would say whatever is true Alex is a horrible source of

1062
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Information

1063
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:36,511
I'd really like to know what to orokin thinks about this

1064
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
With

1065
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
,

1066
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,375
King of the Jews and it's not about Solomon

1067
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,447
You have already let me know that you're an anti-semite

1068
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,567
It's it's a it's troubling that Alex in the year 2021

1069
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,127
Is still peddling this story

1070
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
Literally Devon

1071
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
There's every reason

1072
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
For him to know that this is an anti-semitic falsehood has lingered over the years

1073
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
Perpetuates

1074
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,951
It's a it's a large part of his worldview and congratulations

1075
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:11,839
Do people like Joe Rogan helping spread that message far and wide

1076
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
So Jordan

1077
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
Yeah

1078
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
What does Alex mean money

1079
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
Well

1080
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
I mean in a certain sense

1081
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
He needs a lesson

1082
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,895
Because all of it's going to go away so he should start spending all of it now

1083
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
Let me ask you this what

1084
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Has he sold his house.

1085
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
I actually

1086
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,927
Can't tell you whether or not he's all this house okay although some other stuff might be going up on the Block okay

1087
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,743
Thanks for your support.

1088
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
Lands End project in motion

1089
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
Circumnavigate

1090
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,079
And during key junctures

1091
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
Able to pop up

1092
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,623
Into the future time we're going

1093
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,183
Do I need major wartime capital

1094
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
That's why

1095
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
You're going to see me on air soon because they're will side issues there they're important

1096
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
Selling the armored truck

1097
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
It's been great

1098
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Cupboard with a lot of attention

1099
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
Causes butt

1100
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103

Interesting

1116
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767

To make sure we go in there in the Tom Brady Zone

1143
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,039

Better

1214
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495

Yeah everybody just moves on

1222
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:10,047
So weird that they couldn't tell deny that it even exists

1223
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
For a year

1224
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:17,215
And all of those people will believe them and then they can just suddenly say well that year

1225

These people so much the other they're pretty bad

1232
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
So one friend of Ted Nugent

1233
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
Unfortunately

1234
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:47,935
Apparently didn't believe Ted about the magic of ivermectin Ono

1235
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959

Two days ago and we're still morning we are shattered

1243
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,647
The loss of our loved ones and our dear friends

1244
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,231
And the reason is because the United States

1245
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,535
Is the enemy of America

1246
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,863
Communist Chinese

1247
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Pebbles

1248
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,935
Weaponizing virus

1249
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,239
Mankind

1250
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,311
United States and the Communist Chinese devils

1251
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
Killed my friend Jim

1252
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
.

1253
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:33,247
Alright Ted feel like now that they've admitted everybody had covid

1254
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
Can't we

1255
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Then just

1256
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,879
Hey busy this can be settled with a simple bow

1257
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Bright

1258
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,719
What's up I bet you take the vaccine and you're fine

1259
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
You bet

1260
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,535
That I take the vaccine and I die

1261
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
Okay

1262
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
I don't think that they would go for that

1263
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,191
No cuz then they would have to admit that it

1264
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
That they knew that it was

1265
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,751
Spot me a problem

1266
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:00,127
I hear this and I can't think of anything other than inside

1267
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,663
Out of what that new did say

1268
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:07,295
But my friend I destroy the American government if you have somebody who

1269

Answer they're the enemy of America we need to take out the government

1273
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
It's real bad

1274
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Real bad thing

1275
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Wild

1276
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
Absolutely wild that you can live

1277
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,495
Yeah but you know why Ted Nugent has these thoughts

1278
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
While he has his position

1279
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,847
Cuz he's a lunatic

1280
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,687
Swamp air that could be

1281
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
A lot of ducks have problems

1282
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Disturbing reality as well

1283
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
I would say

1284
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
That if you listen to

1285
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
He would tell you

1286
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
Because he practice

1287
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Critical thinking

1288
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Now I'm thinking

1289
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
Critically about this next clip that I'm about to

1290
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Play Aha

1291
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
It goes off the rails

1292
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:57,471
Pretty fast talking about the great replacement Shore

1293
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,775
Critical thinking is the

1294
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,055
DNA

1295
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
Freedom demanding

1296
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
We the People

1297
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,527
States of America

1298
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
Fathers critical thought again

1299
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
Against

1300
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
Arbitrary

1301
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Monica

1302
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
Rules

1303
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,095
Forced upon its subjects so they wrote down

1304
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,167
He knew instantly to be free to be right

1305
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
Just called the Constitution the Bill of Rights

1306
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Right now

1307
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,103
If you're a critical thinker

1308
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
If you critical

1309
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,919
Entrepreneur

1310
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,655
Michigan ostracized

1311
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,287
This government right now more than ever

1312
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
Critical thinker

1313
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,663
Go to school

1314
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Turn down

1315
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
Emotion

1316
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,183
History of the world

1317
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,023
Travel that you can't live without it

1318
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,727
People from around the world

1319
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,823
Lifestyle

1320
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,383
Are you using critical thinking now

1321
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
Orchestration oven

1322
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
Mission of America

1323
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,551
Government of the United States of America

1324
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
Make that perfectly

1325
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
Berkeley Square

1326
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Gangnam

1327
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Democrat

1328
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Marxist

1329
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
Government

1330
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,303
Orchestrating

1331
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,607
Station of America

1332
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
Our Southern border

1333
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,959
Because those people will blindly obey the

1334
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,495
Holyshit

1335
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
Wow that took Sumter

1336
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:17,759
By rambling about critical thinking is what the founding fathers used as a weapon

1337
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,367
Within 2 minutes where on replacement

1338
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,999
Democrats want to replace the Americans

1339
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:33,375
With foreigners that they can control wish we could get rid of the American Legend so much

1340
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:38,239
I wish we could get rid of the American Legend because the American Revolution was dumb

1341
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
Like here's what happened

1342
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,103
The king stole Land from the Native Americans

1343
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
And then the quote founding fathers

1344
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
Stole it from the King

1345
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,271
Nobody's a good guy

1346
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,599
Yeah there's a little more nuanced than that but

1347
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
That is more

1348
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
To the point version of the story

1349
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
So look

1350
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
These founding fathers

1351
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
Baby super into Alex

1352
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,095
According to Ted Nugent

1353
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,655
Who also says that Alex has a T-Rex balls

1354
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,127
Run by the big AI system and found that the majority of deaths and hospitalizations

1355
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:22,527
And creating a syndrome called a DE

1356
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,855
Overtime kills about 80% of people that develop it

1357
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
Dad

1358
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,695
Project solace

1359
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,023
Spell number one

1360
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:39,423
Weed the people salute you Alex yours cuz you got a T-Rex ballsack switching from coast

1361
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
And and eat your ear what the founding

1362
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,823
Fathers wanted all Americans to be

1363
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
40

1364
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,479
Spirited but you look into it

1365
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Before the government

1366
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
Binding

1367
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
You expose the finding

1368
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,951
Everything's you and I believe in and talk about

1369
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
Call Missy

1370
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,071
Because they guaranteed

1371
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Information on planet Earth

1372
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,679
Comes from the United States of America

1373
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
Government

1374
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
So you talked about that project salads on the last episode I was just lying about that

1375
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,663
Here's the point I want to make

1376
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,759
It's all good and well to be suspicious but that's not what Alex and Ted are

1377
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,855
This isn't suspicion this is coming to a predetermined conclusion and then being

1378
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
Combative about anything that doesn't align with that can

1379
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Conclusion

1380
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,535
It just so happens that the collusion conclusion that they've arrived as if the government is evil

1381
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,863
Dotyville paint anyone who doesn't agree with them as blind cheap

1382
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
But that's just a trick

1383
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
That's just a sleight-of-hand trick

1384
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,847
When someone has a suspicion the appropriate next step is to search for corroborating or disqualifying information

1385
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,895
So you can evaluate that suspicious

1386
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,223
That's what I heard Alex covering that C-SPAN clip

1387
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Apache

1388
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,551
I had a suspicion that he wasn't telling the truth about

1389
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,111
So the only way to deal with that productively with

1390
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Define the raw video

1391
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,671
And assess it for myself

1392
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
I feel like what you should have done is none of that and hung the American government May forgiving him

1393
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,399
Ultimately it turned out that my suspicions was Meredith

1394
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
Alex is lying his ass off

1395
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,775
It would have been probably fine for me to just hear him talking about this clip

1396
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,591
Open say I'm sure he's lying but without learning more

1397
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,943
I would be being lazy about reaching that conclusion and it wouldn't be based on anything

1398
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,039
This show would be really stupid if we just played clips of Alex and said nope

1399
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
Without getting into the details of the story

1400
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,951
It's good to have a healthy distrust in a level of skepticism about things that you're being told

1401
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
That's

1402
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Like knocking argue with

1403
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,863
The problem is that what tennis calling suspicion is actually just him being the lazy

1404
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,191
But rationalizing his knee jerk anti-government position

1405
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:54,847
And then he's like ouu go out there and you find the sources at prove what we knew all along was right no

1406
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
Alex finds things and lies about them in such a way to make them reinforced rightly conclusions that you came to a

1407
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
That's the game that's being played

1408
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
Believe the Ted doesn't know that

1409
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
But maybe not

1410
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:14,559
I think Ted is more than capable yeah he did write Wango Tango

1411
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,631
You've got a real gift for not knowing what it is he stalking

1412
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,911
Thing about buddy has

1413
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Adjectives

1414
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,775
You bring adjectives you don't need no

1415
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Annoying ask Aiden

1416
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Hatem

1417
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
Smoking Gun is Smoking Gun Smoking Gun

1418
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,991
Now we have to talk about it we had to talk to Ted

1419
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Gyros

1420
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,391
Wango Tango he's going to get the information out

1421
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:44,255
Right right so now it's time to really get down to business okay I know it's not we have another guy

1422
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
It's the middle of your busy schedule

1423
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,215
Alex thank you your listeners are getting facts they're getting science

1424
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
Hashtag

1425
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
Science Matters

1426
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,383
And what you're giving people is useful information instead of

1427
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Propaganda talking point

1428
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
B o

1429
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:07,039
I want to thank you for your diligence for your

1430
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,623
Tenacity for not giving up when people have

1431
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,719
Tried to destroy you over and over again you can't keep a good man down

1432
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Alex Jones is a good man

1433
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,863
So dr. Bartlett is the person who Alex keeps mentioning as the guy who wrote in the

1434
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,911
Prescriptions for things like Ivermectin

1435
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,263
He's made a bunch of Waves by claiming that the inhalable steroid

1436
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,335
Budesonide is a quote Silver Bullet against covid

1437
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
Which is not true

1438
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,223
Little boy there may be some positive effects that a patient could get from the steroid but in terms of being a cure

1439
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,271
Which is claimed there isn't evidence

1440
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
What's the sport that

1441
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:44,671
There's a lot to say about this dude he's just using the same kind of game that everyone and Alex's world does

1442
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:49,535
Patients that get better with his steroids are remembered and the ones that don't conveniently get

1443
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,327
Forgotten so the claim of a miracle cure

1444
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,351
And keep being made

1445
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:56,191
And everyone's trying to cover up the budesonide and whatever

1446
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,007
You know what all you need to do is claim a miracle cure

1447
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:02,335
Because sometimes that's how we get Kellogg's cereal

1448
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
Sure

1449
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,711
You haven't thought about that maybe Kellogg cereal is our

1450
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Original

1451
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
Down and out

1452
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
Could be I think about

1453
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
Here's some for you too

1454
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
Think about right

1455
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:18,975
Dr. Richard Bartlett is our guess we just had Ted Nugent on and

1456
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
A ventilator put on you you're probably going to die

1457
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
Percent of people in New York Capital One

1458
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
I have a suspicion about

1459
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
Play decided to look into it

1460
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:40,479
So this is just a whisper from a study those put out in April 2020

1461
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
So it really only captured the

1462
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,551
Beginning of the pandemic response

1463
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,463
They found it in their data set of patients 1151 of them needed to be put on mechanical ventilator

1464
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,559
The only knew the medical outcomes of 320 of these patients

1465
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,607
Of these 88% had.

1466
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:01,215
That number does sound really high but there's a couple of Porton points that you need to remember

1467
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:07,871
The first is that if you're needing to go on a mechanical ventilator you're going to tend to be in the category of more severe cases of Coke

1468
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,455
And you may have a higher likelihood of dying regardless of ventilation

1469
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,831
The second thing to remember is that Approximately 80% of patients who get put on ventilators die

1470
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,623
Regardless of the Panthers

1471
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:21,439
That's how it works as a relevant jump but

1472
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,999
It's not like a jump from 40 to 88%

1473
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,071
This is because my mechanical ventilators are required for talkin

1474
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
But seriously

1475
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,007
The third thing to consider is that 72% of the total patients were put on ventilators are not captured in this statistic

1476
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:40,383
Since they don't have a final outcome yet which is to say they haven't died or been discharged from the hospital

1477
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,503
These 831 people we're still in the hospital and depending how their cases

1478
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
What's the number could be a lot different

1479
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,647
If they'd included these people in the calculation then at that point only

1480
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,975
Approximately 25% of the people put on ventilators with covid

1481
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,023
Had died which is a big

1482
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
Other data sets from around this time

1483
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,911
Places like Vanderbilt and Emory University show death rates

1484
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
Did it right in that ballpark of

1485
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
25 to 30

1486
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,543
The point here is that Alex should get into some critical thinking

1487
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
It might help him

1488
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,663
Yeah that could do that could go a long way and repeating

1489
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
Statistics that he's not putting into a proper context

1490
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Why would

1491
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
Oh it's bad idea

1492
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,159
Surrounded by experts like this dr. Bartlett

1493
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:30,559
Who's playing fast and loose the f****** detailed the most prestigious doctors in the world

1494
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,887
You need to use your brain your training your experience

1495
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:38,239
And this is going to send a shiver down their spines right now but if you go to the NIH

1496
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,543
Guidelines for covid 3

1497
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
Budesonide is

1498
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,735
And I don't know that cuz they don't read these things they don't educate themselves

1499
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:53,599
So this is true actually budesonide is mentioned in the nih's covid treatment guidelines

1500
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
In the section titled quote

1501
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,231
Immunomodulators under evaluation for the treatment of covid-19

1502
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,047
It's something that they think Merit evaluation

1503
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,863
Which is a little different than Bartlett Silver Bullet claim

1504
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:10,239
Budesonide is mentioned 39 times in the entire 365 page.

1505
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,519
Like in this passage

1506
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
Central page 217

1507
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,103
Quote there is insufficient evidence

1508
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,223
Thanks for the panel to recommend either for or against the use of inhaled budesonide for the treatment of covid-19

1509
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,551
Most of the other times it comes up is in the context of

1510
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,831
Get the guidelines discussing

1511
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,367
Studies that looked at budesonide

1512
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Effectiveness

1513
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
In treating covid

1514
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,719
Studies were inconclusive and further research

1515
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Require

1516
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:35,071
The fact that the drug is mentioned in the guidelines means nothing

1517
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,655
But it's the sort of thing that a con man might say if you wanted to make the audience

1518
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,703
Think that even the NIH admit

1519
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,239
The pieces of silver bullet

1520
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,775
Which is the game that's being played

1521
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,591
By dr. Bartlett here on Alex's show

1522
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Big something that they never can

1523
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
Consider

1524
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
About

1525
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,711
The way they view sign

1526
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,271
Sprite is if science actually work

1527
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
The way that they think it does

1528
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
We would get

1529
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,415
A new miracle cure for everything

1530
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Every human

1531
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
Every scientist would

1532
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,999
Constantly be like

1533
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,583
I saw a cleat I thought fix one patient we got the miracle cure

1534
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
Every single

1535
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:15,007
We have we have a couple anecdotal stories

1536
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,847
Oh yeah this one kills everybody this one doesn't kill anybody we've

1537
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,199
Q words this this is all and then 2 weeks later they be like

1538
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
We didn't but nobody paid attention

1539
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
We're onto another thing already

1540
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,415
Insane D idea of if they're if science works like the way they think it does we would live a Non-Stop chaos life

1541
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
Soliloquy of The Smoking Gun Smoking Gun is smoking gods

1542
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
We have to talk.

1543
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,143
Cuz he's a celebrity that has a big-time right

1544
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
Right right

1545
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Right

1546
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,471
We have to talk.

1547
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
Cuz he's an important doctor

1548
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,079
In the world of ivermectin and budesonide and should I like

1549
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
This is

1550
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,175
We have to deal with both the origins of the pandemic

1551
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,503
And the treatment

1552
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:02,111
So now that that's out of the way we can get to talk about the smoking god of the smoking God Of The Smoking Gun

1553
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
Wow actually I'm sorry

1554
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:11,583
Hi, can a biopsy mon louder with Crowder Derek Richards has been banned

1555
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
Hey, teacher

1556
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
That because well the online

1557
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,031
Control freaks the left said that you he said some things they didn't like

1558
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,335
Probably

1559
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
Oh man

1560
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
That's something you didn't like

1561
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:31,551
Another comedian is going to have to make a half hour special about how they aren't allowed to say anything I would never get to talk

1562
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:35,135
You can't turn this off I can't talk

1563
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
So here's the situation

1564
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,071
There was a tour of military bases put on by the Department of Defense and the American forces entertainment

1565
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
Apparently Derek Richards was at 2

1566
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,447
Perform on this tour but then a naval officer found some of his old tweets

1567
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,007
And sent them to the dod and Afi

1568
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
Roman article in the daily.

1569
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
In 1 Richard

1570
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:59,967
Posted a Photoshop meme of Michael and Dell holding a pillow next to President Joe Biden in the hospital bed

1571
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,527
The meanest Captain to make America great again

1572
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
Former Donald Trump

1573
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,623
President Donald Trump's 2016

1574
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Campaign slogan

1575
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
This is just sad

1576
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,023
Well I would be opposed to the dod and afd saying that Richard

1577
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,559
Cannot delete these things

1578
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:21,215
Infringement of free speech kind of thing

1579
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,519
The comedian if he joked online but killing the president

1580
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:29,919
A pretty clear case of behavior that'll get you kicked off a USO tour it is really funny I bet it never occur

1581
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Heard to him

1582
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,991
That the dod would be

1583
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,551
Uncomfortable with that because in his mind

1584
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,623
Trump is the president and they still work for Trump

1585
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,975
Right maybe the idea of him going on a USO tour

1586
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,535
Doesn't make any sense to me because

1587
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,095
They all work for the guy that you want

1588
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
Do you realize that

1589
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Changed

1590
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:56,543
Like the dod would be mad about you Tweeting out of

1591
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
If a binding supporter

1592
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,407
The comic and I was booked to do a USO tour

1593
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,479
3 years ago and I was tweeting out all the things that I was tweeting out

1594
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
3 years ago

1595
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,295
The dod would have understandably been like

1596
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
This is not a good idea

1597
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Usher

1598
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:14,719
And let's be totally clear there is a bit of a difference in messaging between like

1599
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
I don't like Joe Biden

1600
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,279
And

1601
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,095
This meme implying that make Lyndell

1602
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,399
Would make a better country by killing

1603
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,703
Yeah Joe Biden with a pillow

1604
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:29,311
Yeah there is a difference between those things I don't know

1605
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,103
I don't think that it's

1606
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Like

1607
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,223
Advocating killing the president to post that Meme but I also don't think that it's

1608
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,247
All that

1609
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:43,647
Happy Griffin have a header to get to that we're about to we're about to do the whole

1610
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,927
Blankets as

1611
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,207
Outrageous

1612
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,351
To imagine that the Uso would cancel his appearance on this door because of this and other tweets

1613
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
That they found

1614
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,191
It's not a free speech issue

1615
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,751
It's not but whatever they're not saying he can't

1616
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
Sweet now

1617
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
I will say the Derek Richards

1618
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Is

1619
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
At least

1620
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,687
He doesn't seem as mad as Alex wants him to be

1621
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,759
I Harbor no ill feelings towards Armed Forces

1622
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,831
Or the Department of Defense

1623
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
Are there Corporation

1624
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
Esterline bullies

1625
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,607
I mean show what if you were serious Christian or right-wing Christian

1626
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,263
The Avenger telling comedy should be what your comedy is

1627
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
And the whole point is

1628
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:36,127
Now you got the lgbtq groups attacking people that are straight

1629
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,711
What

1630
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,735
Are not inclusive

1631
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,367
Republican

1632
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,927
This is mind control

1633
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,559
This is all part of the leftist Takeover in Purge

1634
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
Inside the military

1635
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,631
You're just a collateral damage

1636
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:04,031
Hey Derek can you be a little matter could you turn this into the biggest most important issue cuz I do not like

1637
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,823
Like conciliatory tone

1638
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,431
What do you think you maybe going to get booked on something again so you don't want to say hey

1639
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,991
F*** the dod a bad idea

1640
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
That doesn't play

1641
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,599
Now we we we shopping anger here that's that's our currency

1642
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,647
Yeah let's let's

1643
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
Let's be important

1644
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
Mr. Richards

1645
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
Your career and its future

1646
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
Meeting with me

1647
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,071
Right now

1648
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
Important

1649
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,911
So I want you to burn it all down

1650
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,311
And then maybe I can kind of force you to act like a drug dealer in force you to work at Infowars career is kindling

1651
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:42,175
Exactly I've never heard of you before my turn told me you were on louder with Crowder

1652
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,479
And I will never think of you again ever

1653
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Yep

1654
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,807
The guy who smashed stuff

1655
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,463
Where's the guy

1656
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,047
Great memes Alex

1657
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Wanted a job

1658
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,911
The last name Richards are not having a good year

1659
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,727
Mark Richards this dude

1660
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,775
I don't know we might as well go back

1661
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
The captain mark

1662
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,615
The same guy that I said

1663
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,407
Ono Mike rich

1664
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,455
The Jeopardy host

1665
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,015
Yeah that's who I was thinking okay

1666
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
Alex is like

1667
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,831
They they

1668
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,855
Hey

1669
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
On the left

1670
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
They insist

1671
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,719
You got to be punished for telling jokes

1672
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,999
What about Obama

1673
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
He told jokes at the

1674
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
The Correspondents Dinner

1675
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,351
He told jokes

1676
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
What about Trump

1677
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,727
Play the clip of Obama being funny at the correspondents

1678
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,287
All kidding aside

1679
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,079
New York

1680
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
Experience

1681
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,967
For example

1682
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,319
No seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice

1683
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,135
At the steakhouse

1684
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
The men's cooking

1685
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,279
Did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks

1686
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,119
And there was a lot of blame to go around

1687
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,727
You mr. Trump recognize that the real problem was a lack of leadership

1688
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
And so ultimately you didn't

1689
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Blame

1690
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,567
Long John

1691
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Meatloaf

1692
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,920
You fired Gary busiek

1693
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:24,576
Decisions that will keep me up at night

1694
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:31,232
Yeah there you go so Derek Richardson he couldn't even some of the evil

1695
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,560
Hollywood folks

1696
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,864
4000 Twitter followers are so

1697
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,008
Such a weird choice to play that.

1698
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,056
It's actually very funny

1699
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:51,456
Ed well-delivered we were laughing before and I was

1700
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,272
It's still very good because it is

1701
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:59,136
Nuance

1702
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:05,536
Know that the order he did even did rule of Threes whoever wrote that joke was really good

1703
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:10,656
I think it's a strange decision for Alex to do that but whatever

1704
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,936
Especially since

1705
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Here's the difference

1706
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,520
That was Obama making fun of a man

1707
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
Four things he did

1708
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:22,432
And the reason that even come up is because he was trying to say that Obama

1709
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,224
I had a fake birth certificate

1710
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,528
And he did this whole racist attack against

1711
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,064
Now if I were Trump

1712
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,392
Yeah and I had led this whole charge on the fake birth

1713
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
Certificate Obama shouldn't be president there

1714
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,488
I would simply not show up

1715
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
To the dinnerware

1716
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,304
Obama speaking

1717
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,328
The wildest

1718
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,912
Ourselves in a position where

1719
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,496
Really offensive to him

1720
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
For a while

1721
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
I just not go

1722
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,920
But Trump recited I'll go and then he got mad and then

1723
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
I do not like being made fun

1724
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:00,576
Open new easy to make fun of me which is why I surround myself with people who refused

1725
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
So

1726
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,464
And a frame this is like these liberal Hollywood Elites

1727
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
Are behind what happened

1728
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,536
Do this guy

1729
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
This Derek

1730
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:15,936
It's fair to say that people like Debra Messing they Amplified the calling out of Eric's tweet

1731
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,776
Didn't search it out and like try and find it just to destroy this guy

1732
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,592
A naval officer named Travis Acres

1733
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,408
Found the because he stationed in the Middle East

1734
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
He'd heard about the upcoming

1735
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,248
Already decided see the performers coming over where

1736
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
Because he loved stand-up

1737
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,808
You found Eric

1738
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,112
Twitter and as he told the daily.

1739
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,928
The further I reviewed is filled his feed the more

1740
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,512
Concerning it became that he would be booked on a Department of Defense sponsored tour

1741
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:44,352
Since Armed Forces entertainment isn't official. Office

1742
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
It's fun to pretend

1743
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:49,728
This is just like all fake Hollywood liberal Elites being on the warpath but

1744
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:55,360
The reason doesn't even being discussed is because this enlisted person was offended by what he saw on Derek's Twitter

1745
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,408
Any tag the dod in a tweet about

1746
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
In order for Alex's outrage

1747
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,992
Machine to run properly though

1748
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,528
That has to be ignored in

1749
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:06,624
Tirerack.com

1750
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,696
Definitely can't also be somebody who was a fan of

1751
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
Cups and up

1752
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,512
Because you've also got that added

1753
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,072
He's not funny enough for me to ignore these tweets

1754
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,632
Insult

1755
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
That is

1756
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,752
Definitely

1757
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:27,360
What's up text I would I would imagine that he would have been like oh Dave Chappelle's coming

1758
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,920
No need to look into that I guess

1759
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,968
Patrice has said some horrible things

1760
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
Oh my God

1761
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,928
So you were bringing up Kathy Griffin and this is where she enters the four

1762
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
Proceeding

1763
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,256
But not before Derek tries to pretend

1764
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,560
But hey man they misinterpreted my meme

1765
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:50,912
And this is what this is where we see his comedic

1766
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Chops

1767
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
There was one

1768
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,056
I was advocating murdering the president

1769
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,104
Meme

1770
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,896
Mike Lindell

1771
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,944
From my pillow holding a my pillow

1772
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:03,968
Standing neck

1773
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
Stu

1774
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,784
President Biden who was lying in a bed

1775
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
And so

1776
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:13,184
Yeah that particular one of the upper right-hand rule

1777
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,280
And it says make America great again

1778
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Now

1779
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,400
Anybody can take that anyway they what is obviously a joke

1780
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,984
I see is Mike Lindell clearly saying that

1781
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,128
President Biden had an uncomfortable pillow and he was offering one of his good my pillows for the president to lay upon.

1782
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:36,992
Here's the deal

1783
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,904
It didn't cross the line

1784
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,488
Yours didn't go 1/10 as far as that is obviously good-nature

1785
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
Good nature

1786
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,072
I'm going to leave aside anything about that

1787
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,888
A fun game the Derek's playing about the tweet

1788
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:59,776
It's supposed to because I don't really care about him tweeting this can do that all day dumb not funny joke

1789
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:04,128
It does make sense that you get kicked off of USO tour for making that kind of joke though

1790
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:08,224
You're entitled to your Free Speech but you're not entitled to be paid to go on USO tour

1791
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:13,344
Also Kathy Griffin is probably the last example Alex should be bringing up because

1792
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
She lost

1793
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,672
So many jobs after that picture came out

1794
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,512
She was fired from CNN where she'd been one of the host of the New Year's Eve show

1795
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,792
You got dropped from gigs

1796
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,864
Nancy claims that you wasn't even allowed to fly for two months

1797
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,496
And then everybody on the left said everything is okay

1798
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,312
The picture also apparently got Kathy Griffin on the Killer

1799
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
List of Cesar sayoc

1800
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
The Amar Kabal

1801
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,968
I wonder why you would put a Target on someone is relatively obscure in

1802
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,040
No just released it admittedly possibly distasteful picture

1803
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,344
I don't know if they said anything to do with

1804
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,440
But allow me to take you back Jordan In My Time Machine May 31st

1805
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,768
2017 kind thoughts

1806
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
Hey Mike cernovich is thought

1807
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
About Kathy

1808
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,888
Here we go

1809
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:02,752
Why did ISIS sympathizer

1810
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,216
Wichita

1811
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:46,272
Do the ball drop she's routinely on.cnn she does comedy Pharmacy her on there all the time

1812
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
Walker casino employee

1813
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
And defendants were going to sell it t-shirt

1814
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,232
You also get $1,000 2500

1815
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,024
If you're seen wearing the T-shirt

1816
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,888
National TV C-SPAN your local news

1817
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,472
Or goes viral I will choose 1000

1818
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,032
2500 until it hits 2

1819
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,568
Hundred-thousand-dollar

1820
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:16,224
Alex and Mike cernovich was so up in arms about the Kathy Griffin picture that they started a campaign to get people to buy shirts

1821
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,272
It said CNN is Isis

1822
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,344
How many people to yell at on live TV

1823
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,648
The argument according to these idiot

1824
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,952
It was like Griffin was signaling to Isis

1825
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,792
Haydocy on that didn't fire her that means they also support Isis

1826
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
It's very very stupid

1827
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
And I remember it very clearly

1828
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,680
I was

1829
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,728
I was looking back to this was like

1830
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,520
It was Mike cernovich yet

1831
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:45,920
Where's Ali Alexander and Alexa

1832
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
Message Alex wants

1833
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,296
To give us about free speech is that when a comedian does something that's politically distasteful

1834
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,624
It's a travesty when that person is fired if they're on the right way

1835
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,672
However if their left-wing

1836
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:02,816
You mean to offer $200,000 to wage a public pressure campaign to label them as an Isis sympathizer

1837
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
To get their employees

1838
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Employer to fire them

1839
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,936
Let's baby labeled Isis supporters as well

1840
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,776
This is a coherent ideology and totally not Alex

1841
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,568
Just pretending to have principles

1842
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
Cuz he's a dumb piece of s***

1843
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,384
Yeah I can also

1844
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,480
Oscar sayoc he tried to bomb this year in at headquarters

1845
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,272
At in Atlanta to so

1846
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,320
That was strange

1847
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
Scenic

1848
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,112
Very weird

1849
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,648
I am not

1850
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,464
Giving a f*** about any right-wing

1851
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,744
Cancel culture

1852
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Bulshit

1853
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,328
Mainly because I was alive when the dicks

1854
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,608
Dixie Chicks at Warriors

1855
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,656
And then everyone

1856
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
On

1857
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,960
Every side

1858
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:46,848
What she said was Natalie Maines said that she was ashamed that the president was he

1859
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,920
That was it's not war is bad

1860
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,736
Slightly different but I get what you're saying

1861
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,040
Sorry it's even less innocuous

1862
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,136
More innocuous

1863
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,160
Yep yep

1864
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
Canceled

1865
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Cashtag

1866
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:07,584
Dixie Chicks burning party in real unreal

1867
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Yep

1868
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
So Alex

1869
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,192
Look you got smoke a gun or smoking, smoking gun

1870
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:15,008
But you needed to talk to Ted Nugent Elizabeth

1871
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,104
Need to talk to dr. Bartlett because he's a guy who's got medical solution

1872
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:22,688
And then you needed to talk to this completely because he got canceled

1873
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
Or something

1874
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
This guy I've never heard of

1875
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,552
He's on a tour that I would have never known happened

1876
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,600
Wouldn't have cared either way nope

1877
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Now

1878
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Now

1879
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:35,232
It's time to get down to the Smoking Gun is smoking, smoking. Okay

1880
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,536
They said the game

1881
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
Very serious

1882
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:45,216
And it makes me angry that the system try to suppress us

1883
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,288
Cherry-picked contest

1884
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,312
Try to silence us

1885
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
I'm sorry what

1886
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,408
We're fighting this corrupt murderous system

1887
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,248
Call our futures Collective

1888
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,296
That was just say this right now

1889
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,440
I salute and I command and I thank all of our affiliates

1890
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,488
Break up with me both

1891
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,280
Russian Coronavirus

1892
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,560
Infowars

1893
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,376
Especially these days

1894
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,192
God course

1895
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,032
Most importantly for a hedge of protection if you have God deems that

1896
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,104
Ask her what has happened

1897
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,968
How thankful I've been knowing you

1898
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,296
2728

1899
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:35,648
The first time you two did a month ago returned in 5 years ago

Or 27 years ago I appreciate all of you

1901
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,744
This has been one hell of a fight

1902
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,768
Would be what

1903
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:45,376
This really sounds like

1904
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:50,752
One saying goodbye remember like a year ago he recorded his fake last show

1905
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,848
I'm looking forward to going back and visiting. What yeah

1906
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:01,248
So he he's pretending he's saying goodbye cuz it's really dramatic haha I know this is a plug

1907
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
I know this is a plug

1908
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,576
I was listening to that and I was like

1909
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:10,720
Just get to the f****** place already has listening to your thank-yous and going deaf

1910
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,792
A f****** plug

1911
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:18,912
It's over here I'm going to try fast-forward about it right now that's okay

1912
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,496
They did this on purpose you understand Falcon cooked it up in Saltsburg

1913
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:34,272
A couple million views of see that and go oh my God this guy's reaching out he's busted through the

1914
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
Blockade

1915
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,208
Can I stop what I'm doing I'm orally

1916
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,792
Weather

1917
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,096
I can't pull off

1918
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Because

1919
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:00,384
You're going to get everybody if we don't stay in this position and just keep

1920
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,480
This is a little of the disappear back like

1921
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
Opera

1922
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,808
This is information Warfare

1923
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,112
This is the truth and if I went away tomorrow

1924
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,648
And that's off they would

1925
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,720
About me and use me as a tool of evil

1926
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,744
I can't do that

1927
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:21,376
The only way I'm able to get our articles

1928
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,680
I'm banned on all the platform

1929
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,984
You can take Clips you can share them

1930
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
You can get them out

1931
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,592
Understand

1932
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,432
Holding up

1933
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Together

1934
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:42,624
Do I need you to support the show I need you to pray for the show I need you to buy products that are already great for you and your family's own just say this

1935
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,672
We got the big sale going on

1936
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:55,936
Percent off across-the-board the emergency I'm going to have to pay out these lawsuits

1937
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:00,032
Sao

1938
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
It's so

1939
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,360
Shocking to me that like

1940
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:07,456
He wouldn't recognize how transparent his tone is

1941
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:12,576
Wanted to like I need to really overdramatize what is going to end up in a place

1942
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,112
It's I think it's

1943
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,952
It takes minutes for the Preamble of the plug

1944
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Unfair

1945
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,024
Unfair I mean I was thinking

1946
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,792
Just like

1947
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:25,120
God if I was there I would have some sort of like

1948
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,144
Playoffs

1949
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,984
You know that's cuz I was just immediately he's going on too long as

1950
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,080
Oh yeah you can taste it

1951
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:38,688
And then it gradually gets louder

1952
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,480
Yeah I just

1953
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
I think

1954
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
There are

1955
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
X

1956
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
When you can get

1957
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:48,672
Smoothly done at pitch

1958
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,232
I could be sitting there be like

1959
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
This guy's got the goods

1960
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
You know this is not

1961
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,376
I mean I remember back in the day I was

1962
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,912
Sometimes

1963
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
Julian

1964
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,216
Pressed by his

1965
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,240
Throws

1966
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:06,336
To add some of it is just like being worn down over time

1967
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,152
Brought me to see it over and over again but this is worse

1968
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:14,016
Yeah I know that one's too obvious he Rambles a bit more and this is what this is

1969
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
There's a lot going on you got my commitment

1970
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,136
To burn the Midnight Oil

1971
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,096
Short as well

1972
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,912
I'm not risking my life and put it on the line to lose this thing

1973
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,240
Illusion means losing I'm not worried about me

1974
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,848
Seriously

1975
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,968
V for Vendetta when he's ready to die

1976
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:55,488
It's only the calls out that cost you and the

1977
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,816
Phone is a 600 plus dollar value on the best phones they've got

1978
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,864
The satellite

1979
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
This is outrageous

1980
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
This satellite phones

1981
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:06,240

Because we I'm losing his lawsuit

1987
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,768
Who's in the lawsuit now

1988
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Finally

1989
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:33,120
With a couple minutes left in the show

1990
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,936
Oh God

1991
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472

01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
I have hair

Insert

2003

Your response to them

2004
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,888
My response to this is

2005
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,704
I hope you find happiness but

2006
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,008
The chances of that are very

2007
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,568
Very very low and I pity you

2008
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336

2009
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,832
Your regular strength

I mean I thought that we had the bombshell I thought we had the Smoking Gun he decides to take up the end of the show

2016
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
Complaining about a woman that

2017
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,480
I guess he's decided his on a track

2018
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
I

2019
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,064

2020
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,088

2021
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
The worst sonreal

2022
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
They couldn't.

2023
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
Have been

2024
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208

2025
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,232
They couldn't

2026
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,256
They couldn't resist

2027
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
Her last name is literally how you react to it tells me everything I need to know about you and you guys told her every

2028
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
Thing you need to know about her

2029
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:49,824
Amazing how you couldn't it was like she cheated up through time itself

2030
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,616
For them to pay it off

2031
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
Yeah yeah basically

2032
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Yep

2033
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,344
And I would imagine that

2034
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:02,880
Stop it

2035
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,672
Hair is capable of finding

2036
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:08,512
Whatever happiness and retains her armpits

2037
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,280
Series E

2038
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:12,352
A lot of people and I'm going to throw this to you

2039
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
And Alex

2040
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:20,032
And whoever that guy was with the comic I have no idea I think it was in the clip that Alex was playing

2041
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:24,640
Look it from somebody else's, sorry about this woman f******

2042
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
Oh my God so yeah I mean

2043
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,016
We just can't not

2044
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:33,856
Shame her for not conforming to your appearance

2045
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
Yes

2046
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,184
I don't even know how you can live like that

2047
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
It's

2048
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
It seems exhaust

2049
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:44,352
Somebody has hairy armpits

2050
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:50,752
Probably more emotionally exhausting than the time that it took me to assess the claim that he was making about that C-SPAN

2051
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,776
And video

2052
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
You know would have been

2053
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,336
Easier for Alex Maybe

2054
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,640
I actually wouldn't but infinitely harder for him because

2055
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,272
Kirby actual stuff you are supposed to cover

2056
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,368
That would have been good let's do two bets

2057
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Yeah right

2058
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,976

01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,120
See how it goes

2062
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,936
By Ivan will be a disaster

2063
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:24,288
I just I don't know I'd love to see him try to be serious and actually cover something but

2064
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Look

2065
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,384

2071
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:42,464
