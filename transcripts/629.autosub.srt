1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

3
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Little bit about Alex G

4
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Question for you

5
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
I'm going to sound like a broken record

6
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,824
Because I've already said this was different

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,176
It's the George Lucas talk show

8
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Yes okay last night we're going to this on Sunday the last night I was able to watch it live for the first time

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,672
I generally I ended I've ended up having to watch the videos when they came out

10
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,232
Yeah it sucks but I made a point

11
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Cuz it was nice day

12
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
4life a special

13
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
And Patton Oswalt

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
All that's amazing just such a fun time watching it live

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
I'm not somebody who you are a very hard lab

16
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
Bursting out laughing out loud just put a delightful time how much fun that grape Jason Mantzoukas showed up

17
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Bazooka.com

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,392
Disappearance had no idea

19
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
So much fun so much fun

20
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
It was all for feeding America

21
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
Good Charities and bi just so

22
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Scrape

23
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
That's great.

24
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,728
Do supposed to go like maybe 2 hours at end up going for

25
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
What's yelling

26
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Perhaps

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
More more low energy

28
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,064
Interested

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
When everybody post

30
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:39,744
Very Robles oh yeah sure.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
You know

32
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
Escape the Room just to see if everybody's crucially and terribly wrong about stuff and then tomorrow course but there's stuff that I

33
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
I've missed and helado negro put out an album this year

34
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
That is so good

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
It's so good

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
There's this track Gemini and Leo that is a f******

37
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
Banger absolute

38
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Non-Stop

39
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Banger

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Ava track

41
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,416
But it's so good it made me feel amazing to find that this I'll have to check that out after the show

42
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,488
We play it now

43
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Episode to go over but I feel like there's something we should talk about

44
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
First of all we're going to take a little break maybe you'd like to explain this to the others

45
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
Not by choice

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
We are going to stop me

47
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Because

48
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
We scheduled this a few months ago you should try and find my buddy marklar I would like to

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,656
Coneheads reference

50
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
Probably

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
So yeah so we have great timing schedule and

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
You just decided

53
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
To do like a week ago or something was coming and they were like we better get to France

54
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
We get to Europe we got to be there at the Ground Zero Man of Steel

55
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
No man's area of

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
Now is right before it supposed to go

57
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
Wild all over everywhere so it's like

58
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Maybe maybe not but

59
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,007
At the end of the day there's no good option so f*** it let's try and go

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
Sure so we may be taking a break unless news changes literally tomorrow for night

61
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Yeah its position because you know like obviously I think

62
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Great

63
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Planning

64
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
To go on this trip for a bit

65
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,255
And so it's not like it's a capricious decision but the same time as your friend

66
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
It's not like you don't know that we're in agreement do I know and it's it's just that trap it's just the wrong it's

67
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
It's a trap

68
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,151
What what do we do as individuals I love your ex

69
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
Non-refundable take

70
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
You betcha

71
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,415
That is correct until

72
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
So you going to be out of the country for a bit

73
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Furlough

74
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
So we decided that it's also going to be like Christmas time

75
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,471
Why not just take a little bit of little Hiatus break

76
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,335
Just for everybody saying kind of perfect timing

77
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
Because there's a lot of stuff on my plate that might take a little while to digest and so while you're gone

78
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
I will have the opportunity

79
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
To go through reset Force which has leaked let's say The Pirate Bay

80
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
I can't tell if I'm shocked

81
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
They're shocked that I was shocked

82
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
Immediately available everywhere

83
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,871
Or just no one would ever leave not exist exist

84
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Smother irons in the fire as well and so a lot of lot of these

85
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Stuff inside like

86
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Having a little Hiatus from

87
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
The normal schedule of the show allow me to get that ready

88
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
What's up when you get back

89
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,327
The Bang Theory really rumrill hard hammer it out

90
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
This is not going to be the last episode of the year

91
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,519
So we will be back before the new year and all that but

92
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
I believe

93
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,663
Probably be back on next Wednesday something like that it's like that

94
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
Maybe around and record something

95
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,647
Stupid just to keep people tied up

96
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
Could be surprised

97
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
If that is the case then there will be something but if not

98
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
I can expect

99
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Is back next week

100
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,775
Trapped inside my room for a day we might zoom in episode f******

101
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,383
I don't know I think that would be very difficult

102
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
You know when you get back

103
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
I will go into isolation for 2 weeks

104
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,855
Yeah we're play everything as responsible as we can

105
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,975
In preparation to go and I'm sure in preparation to leave I have been tested three times

106
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
In the past week so I am

107
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Thoroughly - right now right

108
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
About as negative as you can get so negative

109
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Emotionally

110
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
Outlook in life

111
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
That's good

112
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
You know we got an episode to do to say thank you to some

113
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
New folks

114
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
Who are walks

115
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Hooray thank you so much

116
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,279
I'm about to rain next

117
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,863
Because it's from

118
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
A friend of Luke's

119
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
Joan Sebastian

120
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Journal policy walk

121
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
Conner O'Malley is endorphin port

122
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Juvenile policy

123
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
I'm a policy wonk

124
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
Catalan pronunciation of the name

125
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
She got a little lisp or we can both try this

126
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
Avi

127
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
Avi because it's specified

128
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
I've got to assume it's something crazy

129
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Raisa can't be like

130
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Savvy

131
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Rye Rye

132
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Caviar

133
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Those would be like Elsa possibilities

134
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
It's a double Bluff

135
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Maybe it's there there like there's no way you'll get it because they're those options and you'll think that's too obvious so you'll

136
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Go with

137
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:07,071
Or something like that to my eyes has no common sounds

138
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Zounds in similar

139
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
So yeah I'm going to say Greg

140
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Savvy okay

141
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Well one of us may be right

142
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
I'm a policy and I also have forgotten to make a new text

143
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Cigarette drop but

144
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,623
While you're gone I'll have plenty of time to get that taken care of

145
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

146
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
Money off that heroin

147
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
So good

148
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Is freakishly large

149
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
As we touch down a little bit

150
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,783
I'm knee-deep in a lot of Alex stuff

151
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
God's got this reset Wars project on the plate

152
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
I've got it

153
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,791
Is garbage ass from 2003 and the present day and I've had a lot of them

154
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
How about I had a lot you had a lot

155
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Just a bunch of dumb covid

156
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Conspiracies shift today yeah I mean like

157
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
What are you going to do I don't want to send you off on a vacation

158
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Was just more of that garbage

159
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,199
So

160
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Oh I want to talk

161
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Talk about

162
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
What's happening out there and

163
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
I got

164
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Ashton more information

165
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Are so

166
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
At first and foremost

167
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,767
I just want to say that I really am concerned that most

168
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Well don't understand

169
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
This is a long-range

170
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
That actually involves

171
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
You don't understand that

172
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Your kind of lock

173
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,287
In the idea that they want to eliminate population with you

174
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Of course they do

175
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
The normal

176
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
So we got Terry density giving us an update from Project Camelot lamps

177
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
In case you didn't catch it from the context clues she's talking about covid

178
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
The covid is a long-range plan

179
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
It is not just a population reduction plan

180
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
What Alex has some days

181
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,607
He says it's really just in order to get the passports

182
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Degree on 14th Avenue

183
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,495
Somehow related to carbon taxes

184
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
Why not

185
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Check in with another source of a

186
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,783
Information do you know like there's weekend we could go to Alex and we can hear him talk about

187
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Are you ND population that all day long

188
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
You know where's the fun in that

189
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
We can hear it over and over again

190
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Instead

191
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
Let's let's see what else is out there

192
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
We just won't get on got all the movies we kind of got a view of what the Pleiadians might be up to

193
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,359
But there's a whole host of other folk out there that I don't know what they've got what is their hand in covid

194
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
I was I will say that it's

195
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,015
A little less optimistic than some of the stuff that you hear about Pleiadians

196
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,159
I think it carries worldview is a little darker

197
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Yeah

198
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
Barclays ATM

199
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
Alien

200
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
That we have

201
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Hey

202
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
It used to be like an Interstellar war was going on

203
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
But but it's still it's

204
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
Feels darker now

205
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
I think that's because the old Interstellar war was kind

206
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
The phone it use Conventional Weapons

207
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Photon

208
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Whatever

209
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Covid plan

210
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Could Happen anywhere

211
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Alright it's very different you got to be scared

212
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
Cool it isn't really a depopulation

213
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Implant like you've already said

214
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Unlike counters

215
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Some of Alex's ideas

216
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Here's what's actually going on

217
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
This is not the greatest

218
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Population

219
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Eliminate

220
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Steam

221
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
They're actually

222
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Rolling out some

223
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
That is a concoction

224
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
That is a i

225
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Derive

226
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
So

227
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
They got help from an alien AI

228
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
That's

229
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Comes from

230
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
You know an alien Ray

231
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Off-plan

232
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
And this is what they

233
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Basically you

234
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
There

235
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Information

236
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Compile this biome

237
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Put into your body

238
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
In order to

239
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Make

240
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Erase

241
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Of human cyborg

242
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
We're making human cyborg

243
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
That's the game

244
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
No you might ask yourself why

245
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,255
And you but you're going to put a pan that question will be addressed later.

246
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
As it stands now.

247
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
Don't worry your little head about that Project Camelot has led me to

248
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
To wonder

249
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Why

250
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
Yeah it's probably some new listeners

251
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
I do maybe are not familiar with our Project Camelot breaks a little while

252
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,367
Whatever you got to take a little step away from Alex maybe just don't feel like getting into him

253
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Oh that day Project Camelot is a very nice

254
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,535
Oasis that we can go to talk about silly aliens

255
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
So we got to we got human cyborg

256
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Even bother coming out

257
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Horse

258
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
So you've got

259
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
The vaccine or the virus or maybe both

260
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
I think

261
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
The cheese of the mind that it's all the same

262
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Right

263
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
Create cyborgs out of

264
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
How many sides

265
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
So many

266
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Billion

267
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Billions of cyborg

268
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Right into

269
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
The mechanics of it go a little something like this

270
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Okay

271
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
In order to

272
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
May

273
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Erase

274
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Of human cyborg

275
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
And so this is where it's headed this

276
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
With the graphene oxide

277
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
What does

278
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
The spike proteins linking to the graphing

279
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Oxide

280
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
And then

281
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Jumping

282
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Person to person

283
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
And surface-to-surface

284
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Nothing Stops

285
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
It's actually not even

286
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
And stopped by distance

287
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Possibly

288
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Ashley

289
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Your time.

290
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Minnetonka

291
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Go there right

292
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
Monoxide

293
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
High-protein can travel through time

294
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
Terrible news for Carrie and that is we are all already sideboard

295
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:46,943
Girl cyborg it happened simultaneously everywhere

296
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
Across all time low

297
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,879
But there is a possibility I was thinking about there like maybe being a cyborg isn't an inheritable condition

298
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
So like tube cyborgs could give birth to a human child and oxide and Spike protein combo

299
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Have to like read

300
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,447
Rerun their scam every 49ers game

301
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Natalie transfer

302
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Treadwright

303
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
I don't know

304
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
My only source of information is.

305
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
Telegrafi.com

306
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
It's like a Little Italy

307
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
Metal kind of thing it is actually there are some applications

308
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
And vaccines

309
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
That's kind of thing

310
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
But they're not in covid-19

311
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
Actually this is from a write-up and Reuters

312
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Discussing

313
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,431
Social media posts that graphene oxide was in covid vaccine

314
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,087
The allegations are based on an analysis by a professor in Spain which has been rejected by experts

315
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
He obtained what he himself described as non

316
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Conclusive results after studying one vial

317
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,839
He said the vial was purported to contain a dose of the 50 Pfizer bio

318
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Integra vaccine

319
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
But a messenger service

320
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,799
And acknowledged that the vials origin was unknown

321
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Violin something

322
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
I don't know

323
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
I don't know what it is I don't know who brought it to right at home

324
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,671
Results on the graphene oxide test or non conclusive

325
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Fictional deepthroat is given to random people

326
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,167
This is a dumb narrative is going around in the anti-vax and Camelot type media but

327
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
It's based on nothing

328
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Have you guys there were graphene oxide in the vaccines it still wouldn't prove any

329
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
It doesn't mean

330
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,223
That is a truly remarkable story of a scientist opening his big mouth whenever it did need to be open

331
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
Like what are you doing why are you telling people about this

332
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
I wouldn't have even open the f****** vile

333
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,951
Thrax weed went through the war on terror

334
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Yep

335
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
So anyway that's kind of sourcing we're working on

336
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,887
I'll bring some other sources about

337
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
About this idea

338
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
That's the sort of

339
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
She's jumping around a little bit it's not always about time-traveling graphene oxide

340
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
Is graphite could just be graphite

341
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,903
But there's there's some other stuff like that other day I certainly in the mix

342
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
Interior experts on this

343
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
And

344
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
I have to say that

345
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
The best witness on all of the

346
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Is dr. David

347
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Adair

348
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Interview

349
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Hosted his

350
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
This video is not

351
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
That video

352
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Embedded

353
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Wow

354
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
So

355
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Just want to

356
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Encourage you to

357
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Actually listen to all my interview

358
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
You can understand where

359
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
He's as a young kid when he

360
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
U17

361
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Was brought into an

362
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831

363
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Story Goes

364
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
And he

365
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
They had a

366
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Recovered

367
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463

00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
And since then he's been in touch

375
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
Yeah man you made friends with that AI

376
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
In an underground base

377
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
Cuz he was brought there at 17

378
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
I can tell David Adair was a guy who was pretty gifted with rocket design as a young man and then he lost touch with re

379
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Reality of made-up a fun story to tell people

380
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,743
Well I've been his extended bio on the website Gaia is really remarkable

381
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:49,631
See the smart boys like a child prodigy who studied rocket science at his local library and as a result

382
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
He discovered a new type of engine which used

383
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Quote electromagnetic Fusion containment and could make a rocket go from 0 to 8654

384
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Miles per hour

385
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
In 4 seconds

386
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
A good engine

387
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,087
So this attracted the attention of the Air Force who invited him to test a rocket at the place that he would later learn

388
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Area 51

389
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,743
After the test went well he was taken to an underground Base by quote black suited government agents

390
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
I'm shown an engine that was similar to his which was broken

391
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
Alien the government needed to fix it

392
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,031
But upon further inspection a tear quickly understood to be of a lien origin and claims

393
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
It was actually a living organism that could only be controlled telepathically

394
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,063
For started to suspect that these military folk we're up to no good and he was right

395
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,671
They wanted to use this engine as a way to give themselves a nuclear First Strike capability

396
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
Right because it would go so fast did they need that

397
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
No

398
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
But I guess the idea is that it would go so fast

399
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,143
That the nukes would already be there by the time that anybody could

400
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
Reply yeah yeah yeah

401
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
I mean I suppose

402
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,543
Yeah it seems like an unreliable way

403
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
B2 Bass

404
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
First strike

405
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Capabilities

406
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Communication diplomacy

407
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,879
Realizing the military's intent he had he had to somehow sabotage his rocket

408
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
So it couldn't be used as a vehicle for a nuclear warhead

409
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Ascent convenience coming on

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
Thinking quickly on his feet did using some cunning Ingenuity says he collected graphite grease to cause a chemical reaction

411
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
Done with.

412
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
An isotope necessary for Fusion reactions that was contained in the Rocket Center working

413
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,360
This tactic worked setting off a massive explosion

414
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
According to a bear this upset Rudolph

415
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,736
Who's a former Nazi scientists

416
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
Working on this route

417
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:57,120
Prison him at the base for the rest of his life forcing him to remain there and continue working

418
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,984
General Lemay I came to his rescue however and allowed him to return home

419
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
I don't believe any of this

420
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,176
The number of problem I'm unclear if like

421
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
You know they wanted him to fix

422
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,552
That the engine that they had it.

423
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Hidan

424
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,928
Sabotage one of his old Rockets or did he sabotage

425
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
That engine

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
That was it

427
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
Murder

428
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
So I don't know if the case or if they were like haha

429
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
You make your own rocket

430
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
Sabotage

431
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
You can just not built that engine for them

432
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
Do you know I'm getting something a little bit similar to The Last Starfighter here

433
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Do you what goes to

434
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Find something funny Batman

435
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Government agent

436
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,512
Right I think there's a lot of similarities to

437
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
And stories the children come up with

438
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,960
Yeah yeah like Alex's dad was the smartest boy in Texas and

439
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
He was recruited by dr. Erwin

440
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
Beer in order to help with the depopulation

441
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Agenda

442
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
Daddy said no and was allowed to leave

443
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,504
We would have killed this dude I want more oversight on hiring practices

444
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
If our government just

445
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Here's about a kid who built the rocket one time and then takes them straight to Area 51 right

446
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Shows them

447
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,840
Alien engines that they had and I like now create your own rocket

448
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,936
And then they create their own rocket or whatever and sabotage it intentionally

449
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
To the point where a Nazi scientist is threatening to keep him there on the base and force him to make rockets the rest of his life

450
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
Yeah they're like how you get out here

451
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:55,136
You know the most important secrets of any government to there's ever been and obviously you should just go out

452
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Make your own website

453
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:01,280
Like essentially create a scenario where there's these people who are

454
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
Organizations that have no respect for human life

455
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Except for in very very specific Circle

456
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Consensus

457
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
That are needed in order for their stories to make sense these specific people stay alive

458
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,456
That the aliens who are willing to wipe out all of humanity are like well obviously not.

459
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
To build a rocket

460
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
These military folks are trying to create a way to have a nuclear first strike

461
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
To wipe out an entire country

462
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Kill this guy

463
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Who refuses to work with. I mean to be rude

464
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Nez United States

465
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,192
It would be rude almost any

466
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
Country that you managed to Nuke

467
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
And take out like a

468
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
Planets the level every

469
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
Otherwise I would be US citizens

470
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
Almost every country for one reason or another

471
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Seattle seems dumb

472
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:01,184
I think that for his storytime any credibility he would have to be dead

473
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
No one is thinking clearly if they believe this story

474
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Nope

475
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
This guy is one of

476
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Who carries big sources on this AI stuff but

477
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,496
She at she has another source on I'm just along with like Nano stuff

478
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
We're talking about

479
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Whole New World

480
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
And

481
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
But the people that aren't

482
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Following

483
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
My work

484
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
And don't really know

485
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Some of the other p

486
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
People that are out there I try to make

487
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
A list of some of the

488
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Influences

489
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
And

490
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Whistleblowers

491
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
I talked to on these various

492
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Subjects

493
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
But I'm in

494
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
Investigating Naia

495
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Nano

496
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Now four years

497
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Captain Mark Richards

498
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Which is one of the other Bash

499
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Princess out there

500
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Is great great going great expert

501
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Can she go visit I don't think so I don't think so either right

502
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Richard's in Perris

503
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
The information that

504
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
She's gotten from him

505
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
To go visit him in prison because he has a

506
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,624
A convicted murderer he did murder that

507
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,440
And she has to go it sometimes she can only use a crayon

508
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
It's a lot of fun

509
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
Skype Mark Richards did that murder in 1982 and he's been in jail since

510
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
1984

511
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,216
Here is the state of cutting-edge technology that we had in 1984

512
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
The CD-ROM had just been invented nose pretty excited stuff you can store up to about 550 makeup

513
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
Bites of stuff on a CD as a blank CD was the beginning of my long and illustrious music pirate

514
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
The first edition of Microsoft Word had just come out weird processing very exciting

515
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,536
Flippy wasn't even here you could be with his father's eyes

516
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
So Apple just released the original Macintosh in 1984

517
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
For the time but it also sucked ass it was when the commercial came out and they threw the thing into the screen and it was like

518
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Hybrid commercial

519
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Tron was in theaters

520
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
It hasn't gotten better than that. So I don't know if I would necessarily trust Mark Richards as the best

521
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
Expert on cutting-edge technology seeing as he's been in prison

522
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,072
Since I was born to do I'm sure people print out Wikipedia article for and B6

523
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:20,448
He could read up on some stuff but you're still fairly disconnected from

524
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
I don't know I'm not

525
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Especially Secret

526
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,408
Stop let's forget that according to Carrie mark

527
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,504
His Spirit body leave prison all the time ago.

528
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
We need

529
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Dive

530
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
Captain

531
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
Is out and learning all kinds of stuff about Ai and nanotech a series update

532
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
On his second-in-command who was in prison with him

533
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
And it was very

534
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
Importance during one of our episodes and then we never heard about him again

535
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
I think so he never saw I thought there was no resolution to it I feel like it was a throwaway thing

536
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:07,040
Thing that you mentioned that bike is his Lieutenant Florida

537
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:11,904
Marco's created his own video

538
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
Yeah I think he got transferred that was that was what

539
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,328
Maybe it was even just to another part of the same Vacaville prison

540
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm not entirely sure but

541
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
So there's other people get it

542
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
People get it

543
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
Dr. Carrie madej

544
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
He is one of the

545
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
The doctors out there that really under

546
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Your stand

547
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Who gets it

548
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Understanding

549
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
What this thing that this

550
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Nano

551
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Graphene oxide Nano is act

552
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Aware

553
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
This actually get

554
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Into

555
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
What some people may

556
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Look at as

557
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Should have a kind of

558
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
A sorcerer or witch

559
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
Craft

560
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
It's it's an understanding

561
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
That we're living in a universe

562
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Multiverse

563
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Conscious

564
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Yeah

565
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Witches real

566
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,320
I have a few things to say the first is

567
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
There are similarities between the Project Camelot world and Alex's are both heavily dependent on

568
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,888
Fairly similar conspiracy sources things like the protocols of the Elders of Zion

569
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:32,288
They both have Deep anti-communist Roots really at their core they have a number of over

570
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,688
Laughing experts like Leo zagami was a character on both there's other people too but he

571
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
He's the one who comes to mind the most a like to say that murder is didn't kill anybody

572
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
Of course

573
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
I'm finding it very interesting

574
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
That

575
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
No

576
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
People often

577
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Accuse me of being a witch

578
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Yes

579
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,496
I if there is any

580
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Evidence

581
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
It's that

582
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Years ago we started doing Project Camelot episodes

583
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Sounding

584
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
Very Project Camelot listening to this project

585
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:23,488
Yeah they're intersecting in a way that I think a lot of people would not have expected

586
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Yeah I mean I think a lot of people call you a witch

587
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,656
Or a wizard or something along those lines but what they don't realize is that you have just

588
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
Tapped into the conscious universe

589
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:37,056
And are simply downloading the

590
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
Also this Carrie Maday

591
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
She's also now pushing the idea that the vaccine also contains a quote

592
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
Jellyfish like tiny invertebrate called Hydra voulgaris multiply and form independent

593
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
Neural networks inside the covid-19

594
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Hank adult

595
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
Currently influence their thoughts and actions

596
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
Okay so you're so she's telling me

597
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,960
That there is a microorganism that can then get into my brain

598
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,104
Create its own neural network within my brain's neural network that's creating a separate

599
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
Or perhaps symbiotic personality

600
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,968
So what if what if we all just get buddy

601
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:23,648
What would you mean like I mean friendly Hydra vulgaris nervous system in there maybe they start to learn

602
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,256
Learn more about you and the humanity and then everybody gets a a fun little monster

603
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,328
I'd prefer that not

604
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
Be the case

605
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
Although realistically

606
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,056
Could you without using some kind of a brain scan or whatever proves that was already the case.

607
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
From birth

608
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
That is a good point

609
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,504
Functionally what would the difference be an observer effect

610
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
Carrie gets it

611
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,160
She's an expert on covid vaccines

612
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,304
I can't handle her name it sounds like an old Irish idiom of some sort just like

613
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
Itto just you can't you can't avoid it it's also really distracting cuz it ends in a j

614
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Pronunciation

615
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
We do we do

616
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,640
So we can talk a little bit about how this is getting a little reset Wars

617
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
I just

618
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,552
This is the clip where the actual title of it is we're getting into recent worth territory

619
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
Everywhere everything has a d

620
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Kind of car

621
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
You know this table has a

622
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
The molecules that make up

623
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Consciousness

624
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Okay

625
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Thomas Reed

626
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
3 and some is a lot more

627
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Sophisticate

628
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
When you have conscious

629
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
And when you understand

630
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
That the universe

631
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
It's not only conscious

632
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Telepathy

633
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Up yours

634
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Thought

635
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Anakin

636
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
It can relay the thought

637
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
It can be like a network

638
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Relaying

639
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Your thoughts

640
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
From one person

641
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Send to another

642
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Thing to another

643
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
And so on aunt.

644
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Basically

645
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
We're living in

646
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Yeah so there's there is

647
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
Kind of basic Law of Attraction Kanye.

648
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,264
It's a bit similar to the scam that Alex is putting out now

649
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,824
Even more parallels

650
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
This goes along

651
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Run right

652
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
I think the problem I have

653
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
That is you're telling me that I have a conscious

654
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
Me either.

655
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,368
So does that microphone here talking into microphone

656
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,256
The constituent parts of the microphone

657
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
You have to every molecule within my brain operating to create my Consciousness also has

658
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,776
Has its own Consciousness that and they're all kind of hanging out talking

659
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:54,176
Being like what are we going to do today haha let's wipe

660
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Organisms are just the Bud Light guys

661
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,552
How's the new Mac coming along

662
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Yeah I guess

663
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,744
Exhausting kind of thought

664
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,816
He's trying to argue that my all of my molecules

665
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
Don't have a consciousness

666
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
I feel like that would be counterproductive for her argument

667
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
Everything

668
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,408
Each molecule has its own Consciousness right you are a singular consciousness of yourself

669
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
Trillions of Consciousness Niecie's but that seems

670
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Pepsi

671
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah I could go for that I think she would be able to follow your eyelash has a Consciousness in the parts of your eyelash

672
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
I have a consciousness

673
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
And then the electrons that are in the atoms inside but I'm saying I just want a little microorganism

674
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Somebody to be in my brain

675
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
I don't fully understand what the benefit

676
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Of understanding

677
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
All of your

678
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:57,920
I like every part of you has a consciousness

679
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
But thankfully

680
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
Carrie is there to tell you that you get super powers

681
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
A growing Concha

682
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Out there in terms of

683
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Human starting

684
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Recognize

685
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Recognizing there not

686
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
The only ones

687
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Nice and highly

688
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Developed

689
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
So

690
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
When you get into machine of course

691
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Everyone knows

692
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
The ghost in the

693
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Machine and sew on

694
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
And the tech

695
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Industry a lot of them

696
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Are very aware of

697
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
And people that have

698
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Certain abilities

699
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Slack

700
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Concern

701
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Street lights on and off

702
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
You know I actually I can

703
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Turn that TSA

704
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Turn those off

705
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Broken

706
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
I would that I didn't want

707
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
So

708
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
This is

709
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Just an ability to

710
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
To throw your

711
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
What is your organ

712
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Out

713
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
To change the world

714
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
And so it

715
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Viewed as a kind of

716
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
Witchcrafter Magic

717
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Or whatever one

718
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Call it

719
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
But it's not just

720
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Dark it's also light

721
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
The magic

722
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Excel

723
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
The Power Inn

724
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Us

725
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
It's not

726
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
Either dark or light

727
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
So this is what we're really talking about

728
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
That's what I'm talkin about

729
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,352
That's exactly what we were talking about magic powers

730
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
Street lights go on and off

731
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Which could just be flickering

732
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Of the lights

733
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
That you're describing

734
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Some kind of causality to your thoughts to

735
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,408
That's possible I would guess that maybe the turning off TSA stuff is like

736
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
She walked through something with a belt and it didn't go off or something or she was like looking

737
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,464
To commit a crime and had a duffel bag full of guns and she made it through financial I got that must have been magic there's no way

738
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,328
Will be that extreme

739
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
But I mean like I've gone through

740
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,960
Accidentally gone through with a lighter

741
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Sure

742
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,592
I haven't stopped me to study people get through there with s*** all the time

743
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
Yeah it might have happened to shut it off at my mind

744
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Like a leaf blower

745
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
It's just

746
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,368
Leaf blower breaking I imagine that she's recording

747
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
Video and there's a leaf blower going outside its really annoying

748
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
MMA finish if you'd like

749
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
I made it stop

750
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
Amazing she said she

751
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Broke

752
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
Before the leaf blowers

753
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
In my head

754
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:35,616
She was outside on her driveway just getting all these goddamn leaves out of here just three jurijus

755
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,992
Please this is the worst time of year and then the Lefroy suddenly breaks on her and she's like

756
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
I got too mad

757
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
That's what happened I broke it

758
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,928
Because of my advisor my Oregon

759
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,792
The fuk is Oregon just another word for cheap flicks spirit

760
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
Oregon

761
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,704
You think you know the name but you don't cuz we've changed it even though it's the same thing as a slightly different tradition

762
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
The issue is

763
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
They're trying to take control of our body

764
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,432
Right by way of the covid-19 graphene oxide they can time travel

765
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Or something

766
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
For some reason

767
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,880
I'm struggling to introduce this clip

768
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
I don't know what it

769
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
I don't know what anything means

770
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
I don't know what you

771
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
She's talking about

772
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
It's not out of context

773
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,840
Sounds nonsensical

774
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,936
Let's see if you can take a swing at alright okay I'll be looking forward to it

775
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Control of

776
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Covid

777
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Is all about

778
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
And so first of all they used

779
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
You know they went back

780
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Time they had mine

781
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
Mind control in so everything that

782
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
Payment to add

783
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Fort Eisman

784
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Movies

785
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Bucks

786
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
You name it

787
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
As info

788
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
I already got to stop

789
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
So they went back and they time travel

790
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:02,656
That was where I felt you should have stopped

791
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,472
Time travel different advertising

792
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Right

793
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
The change people's minds about something

794
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
I'm struggling

795
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,200
With the idea that they have time travel and yet are failing

796
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Right

797
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
They can

798
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,416
I remember now we're getting into so many Multiverse

799
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,232
Bulshit non-direct is that it's like I don't even

800
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
What are you talkin about their failing

801
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
Sleepy time travel

802
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
And they used it

803
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Advertise

804
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,496
Right they went back in time to use there

805
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Powerful mind-control don't know who they is

806
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Casual conversation about time travel

807
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,368
We know covid can also exist across time periods and travels through time

808
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,208
You can travel through time

809
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
So yeah we'll get we'll jump back into this

810
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
Let's see if we get some more ideas

811
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
In other words

812
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Can have an

813
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Fluent

814
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Impact

815
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
It gets embedded in your memory

816
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Influence

817
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Behavior in the way you look at

818
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
So the more they be

819
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Became aware of

820
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Of course not to

821
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Germany weather

822
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
Ground Zero for a lot of

823
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
This stuff to be

824
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
We put into

825
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Experimentation

826
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Basically

827
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Through

828
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Slaves

829
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Being influenced

830
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Standish way

831
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
They they did experiments

832
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Extensive

833
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
But

834
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
This is another

835
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Piece of

836
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
This is the

837
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
The story where

838
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
They not only one

839
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Want your mind

840
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
And your hearts and Minds

841
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
But now

842
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Emotions they

843
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Sort of

844
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Relating through

845
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Hollywood

846
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Or

847
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Ball game

848
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
So

849
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Now what they want

850
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Your body

851
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
I get the point is that they want your body

852
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
But it don't understand

853
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
Any of the rest of that match

854
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,216
No they went back in time and did some advertising Marketing in order to

855
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Implants

856
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:19,616
Suggestions that impacts your behavior or whatever but also

857
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Why what

858
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,016
What was it that they implanted or what was the point

859
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
How does going back in time at advertising

860
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
Affect their ability to get or not get our bodies

861
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
I don't know

862
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
I was I was a little bit concerned

863
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
I'm confused at this point

864
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
I mean

865
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
See what the moment you

866
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,984
The moment you enter time travel as being a blase just like

867
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
They took a flight to Australia

868
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,151
It or they went back in time to the 60s right to do advertising

869
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,479
Then ask yourself like

870
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Okay

871
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
So that you did that

872
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
But

873
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Time change

874
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
If

875
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
Time did James

876
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
Then it wouldn't matter because I can't

877
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
Possibly know that

878
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,327
That right and if they know it and I don't time did not change

879
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:16,703
Then that means that we live in a Multiverse Theory and you can actually change our universe whatsoever at all

880
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,799
Sure I made it it's the same thing with the graphene oxide going back in time

881
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
We were all cyborgs was that he could do about it or there's another

882
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,991
Reality where they did

883
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
We can't get there

884
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,343
These types of people just really don't want to

885
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
F*** around with time travel

886
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:40,511
They shouldn't do it cuz you don't even know what it means if you don't know what it means

887
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
You know

888
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,839
You have a lot of fun ideas

889
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,887
And then you add travel into it

890
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,471
Tunicates message

891
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Also interesting to note

892
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,895
But substantial portion of recent War seems to be about Edward Bernays

893
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:02,015
Advertising

894
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,415
Impacting your decisions and such another pretty wild

895
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Bearnaise

896
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Do you know anybody

897
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,399
I know somebody claim deed

898
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
Edward Bernays

899
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
So that was good was very confusing

900
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
I don't really know what you was saying

901
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
Ultimately I don't care

902
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
So that's good

903
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Yeah that helps

904
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247
Because I also got the point and that is what they want

905
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Our bodies

906
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,063
That's really what you was getting at

907
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Yeah but again

908
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
I don't she hasn't

909
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Explain why

910
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Well okay so we are going to get away

911
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
Maybe

912
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
So why do they want your body be

913
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
Because they are

914
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
In many cases

915
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Just a r

916
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
Aliens from other planets

917
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
In some cases their Acts

918
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Play discarnate

919
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Spirits

920
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Jordans

921
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
Cases they are

922
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
Dark

923
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
But in many cases they are also

924
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Off-planet races

925
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
To have

926
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
Who are not even

927
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
3D

928
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
They're

929
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Coming from other than

930
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
So they can

931
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Today

932
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,607
5D

933
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Bass

934
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Take over your

935
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Your body

936
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
Or whatever

937
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Purpose Maybe

938
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Experience

939
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
3D

940
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Call asensei

941
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
State University

942
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Because it's so

943
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
Sort of touch

944
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Chameleon

945
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
You can have

946
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Awesome any sensation

947
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Lake the life around you

948
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,671
Yeah so yeah I got these other

949
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
3D 2D 5D 4D beings all that they want to take your body because it's fun to touch

950
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
It's great to touch

951
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
In the 3D reality universe and I did not realize

952
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,663
I would assume

953
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Yeah

954
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,319
Eat delicious food hedonistic lifestyle that they've watched us

955
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Live from afar

956
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,975
That might be appreciate the idea that I had not

957
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,071
Considered before which is that we are being invaded by line segments

958
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
Sure

959
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:31,775
Comic strips that don't have that much

960
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,175
We're fighting a 2d enemy do I just have to move around to the other side and then it's a line again

961
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,479
That's one strategy

962
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,551
So we got we got these demons

963
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Alien song

964
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
And they want to take our bodies

965
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Because they want to touch things

966
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Okay

967
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
I mean couldn't we have just talked

968
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
We are plenty of people will be like you want to wait would have a bustling human tourism

969
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:05,567
Industry I would say that's possibility boost economies

970
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,223
CID like to transcend the third dimension and get to like higher dimension

971
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
Isn't that kind of part of

972
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
All the

973
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,391
New AG stuff is always greener on the other side

974
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:31,167
If you end up in like a fourth or fifth dimension through all this like really hard spiritual work

975
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
I want to touch stuff like

976
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
I think that it might not be worth it

977
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
I mean it's hard not to look at the Mark Twain writing about how was everybody's day

978
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
Like they always want to get to heaven but all they want to do is drink and f****** they won't allow anybody to drink at f****** Heather what are you guys talking about you

979
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Classic

980
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
So

981
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
They want our bodies

982
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,231
Someone in Saudi Arabia

983
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
No idea no idea what's going on here

984
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,863
Someone in Saudi Arabia Subway

985
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
The doctor that's one of

986
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,239
But I care resources creating a cyborg Army

987
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Example

988
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Dare talk

989
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Sofia

990
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
Citizen

991
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Arabia

992
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
And she basic

993
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
They told him that she

994
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
She decided she

995
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
The body

996
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
And then

997
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
She wants to be

998
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
Spell lots of

999
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
AI body

1000
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
The ai's can inhabit

1001
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
She doesn't want humans

1002
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Timesheet

1003
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Whatever

1004
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Her or a

1005
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Versions of her

1006
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
You know Android

1007
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
Creating an Android

1008
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Army

1009
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
So they they're doing that

1010
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
They're allowing her to

1011
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,967
I ate the pronoun reference is tough

1012
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
In this

1013
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,927
Another thing that really confused me is apparently this person who's a Saudi Arabian citizen named Sophia

1014
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,487
I told David that she wants a body

1015
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:05,375
Possible to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia without a body

1016
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,959
How to get physical papers if she's not a physical being

1017
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
All kinds of problems are arising from this whole situation

1018
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
And I think the most important

1019
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
Maybe the positive side effect of

1020
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
Is that if we know that there are a bunch of AI

1021
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Humans out

1022
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Right

1023
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,767
Then that proves Beyond a reasonable doubt that gender is completely and wholly accounts

1024
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Because

1025
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:38,143
Those people I bet they've got twigs and berries and all kinds of fun stuff

1026
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
But you couldn't consider them gender

1027
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
Okay cuz they're artificial

1028
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
Okay

1029
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
I do I think it's

1030
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
I mean

1031
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
Secondary

1032
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,551
The interesting aspect of this but I think there's bigger issues namely that

1033
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,695
A ghost in Saudi Arabia who the citizen is trying to create a cyborg

1034
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
I like the idea I want to meet a ghost in Saudi Arabia and then only talk about gender as a construct

1035
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,727
I think I'm interesting ideas for you

1036
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
But

1037
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
How's David Adair in touch with this ghost

1038
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,407
Why is this ghost telling David Adair this stop

1039
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
I'm very good but you mention is this ghost

1040
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,087
Who sponsored at this deal Sophia wants a body obviously not the third dimension

1041
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
No

1042
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Interesting

1043
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,207
A little bit not very

1044
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
Could you just take anybody I bet that blowing out wolves

1045
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
People call people suck

1046
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:48,799
So much better Locomotion available

1047
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,151
God

1048
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,735
Yeah or like a gibbon

1049
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,527
That be great

1050
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,927
Swing around on trees animals that lives in hedonistic lifestyle they'll pick an anime

1051
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,999
Have to go to f****** work Monday through Friday

1052
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Yeah

1053
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Yeah

1054
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
That is

1055
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:18,239
The consideration you create a body and you have to have a job

1056
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,775
That sucks

1057
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:26,175
Boy if you're an alien you just sitting here like I just wanted to touch stuff and I don't want a job

1058
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,759
Well guess what buddy not here

1059
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:34,367
But Richards has some other stuff to bring in

1060
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
As Mark Richard says

1061
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
Every space

1062
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Sparingly

1063
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Race

1064
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Create

1065
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
You know these bodies

1066
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Light gray

1067
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
The biological

1068
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Is there actually

1069
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Anybody

1070
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
They're not

1071
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Terribly

1072
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Intelligent

1073
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
A lot of them

1074
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,479
You know there are the ones that are

1075
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Races

1076
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
Look more like

1077
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
The universe

1078
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
The Multiverse

1079
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:09,951
I mean

1080
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
Why

1081
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
My point is why

1082
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
There is no limit

1083
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Just like you have anime

1084
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
We are part of

1085
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Creator we mirror

1086
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
When we say we're made in the

1087
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Image of creator

1088
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
Wii mirror

1089
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
So.

1090
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Getting real real

1091
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
At War Z there what do you have

1092
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
BoBoiBoy

1093
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,015
Also I would say

1094
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,367
Suggest the people like Carrie are the ones were limiting God's imagination

1095
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,951
All of her f****** alien races are just animals from Earth

1096
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,255
Anthropomorphic

1097
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:48,607
Or they're in Morpheus gases of some sort from the river

1098
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
Quote-unquote Dorothy standard idea of like grey aliens or humanoid

1099
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
Get like a mantis.

1100
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
Start cats

1101
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Dog aliens

1102
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
The Raptors think of a million different things to anthropomorphize before you just started with anime

1103
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,831
And then you could also just go into like

1104
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
It's on we can't view it

1105
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,207
Break us all rise. Do you understand we can't see it

1106
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
It's in a different dimension a we evolved in the third one

1107
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,375
So we can see if there's other dimensions but in those other dimensions

1108
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
They're still just

1109
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,311
Bugs

1110
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,335
Pensionman

1111
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:36,479
Yeah I think also it's great to have an active imagination when you're writing like something creative

1112
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
But when you're

1113
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
Decoding the secrets of the universe

1114
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,159
Imagination is not one of the tools

1115
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
That you needed the most

1116
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,023
I think they kind of gets in the way a little impedes thing

1117
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
I think there is a

1118
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Deep

1119
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Deep

1120
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Deep Huber

1121
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
In

1122
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Mocking

1123
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
Dumb AI

1124
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
For being dumb

1125
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:04,127
And kind of giving a laugh like hahaha it isn't this a I took to be very she did say song

1126
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
Are not right

1127
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
But

1128
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Fictitious

1129
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
And She Believes In Me

1130
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
So who's Dumber

1131
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
The dumbass

1132
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,367
Or the person who created the dumb II to laugh at

1133
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
For being stupid

1134
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,535
The person who believe the murderer

1135
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,863
The dumb AI my buddy trumpism play

1136
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
But he was really just trying to save Humanity

1137
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,239
From becoming cyborgs

1138
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
And so will

1139
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
We talked to

1140
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
People like Trump

1141
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
Or 107

1142
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
Or others that are

1143
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
What they're trying to do

1144
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Preserve our way of

1145
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Have life

1146
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Reserved

1147
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Humanity

1148
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
Without

1149
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Cyborg

1150
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
There they have a

1151
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Platform bed

1152
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Want to rescue

1153
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
The children that

1154
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Patapon

1155
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
That are being used

1156
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Abused

1157
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
Sexually and otherwise

1158
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Slavery

1159
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
And so on

1160
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,215
This is going on on planet

1161
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
And off

1162
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
We got space slavery

1163
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:11,199
So why do seven mentioned before in the past

1164
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Carrie thinks

1165
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
I don't know if she thinks anymore but thought he might be JFK jr.

1166
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,951
He was making the rounds

1167
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,023
The qanon circles what have you also

1168
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,119
Glancing over some of her recent videos it seems like she's a little fed up with these dudes

1169
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,215
I would hope so you put up or shut up kind of moment

1170
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
F****** time

1171
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
It's

1172
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
Sparta Tennessee

1173
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,687
Hey listen people I can come over

1174
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,527
All of you people who already have your money and ran

1175
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
Hey people who made up a bunch of s*** it's time for you to back up that stuff that I believed when you make them

1176
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,743
Not going to happen no

1177
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,535
So do you understand rocket science

1178
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,863
On a fundamental level absolutely not

1179
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Well

1180
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
That's only cuz you're dumb

1181
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,287
You know as above so below a lot of what

1182
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
Sharing it's not

1183
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
Really Rockets

1184
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Or

1185
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
If you want to understand

1186
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
And she's really not

1187
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Understand

1188
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Is all comes down to the boat

1189
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
2 energy

1190
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
To using energy

1191
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
The end of using energy

1192
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Influencing

1193
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Push it

1194
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
Or pull it

1195
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
Or make it going some

1196
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,863
Witches and warlocks magicians know this information

1197
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,007
You don't understand what witches and warlocks and wizards Ronaldo Jordan

1198
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
That's the problem

1199
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
Man

1200
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,639
I think if there was a massive difference between understanding

1201
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
That like rockets work by

1202
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:51,039
Pushing energy downwards compulsion at knowing how to build

1203
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,439
The equations involved with rocket science

1204
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,767
It's not just understanding that downward Force

1205
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
Pushing something upward

1206
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,607
I mean you know it's a real bummer

1207
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
That Parsons and l.ron Hubbard did a lot of drugs and fought demons

1208
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,103
Whatever because this is where we get what happens when the father of Rock

1209
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,199
Scientists also believe that Elementals that shouldn't be surprising to anybody

1210
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
Yeah

1211
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,783
Yes it's big it's the fruit

1212
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
The comes from that tree hey look we got to the Moon we get Project Camelot

1213
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
You take the rough with the smooth

1214
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,911
So

1215
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,823
What are the other things that I find is limiting the imagination of God in terms of people like area people like

1216
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,103
Alex is the belief

1217
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
In like intergalactic

1218
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,759
The contract law and like these bizarre ideas of rules that exist throughout the Universe

1219
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
That have to do with like

1220
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
Morality or something

1221
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
Alvin and Carrie brings up a little one here

1222
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
The Creator is

1223
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
There are laws

1224
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
That favor life

1225
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
So embedded laws

1226
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
In the e

1227
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Around us

1228
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
Which come from

1229
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
Influencing life

1230
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
A positive way

1231
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
A planet

1232
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
Intuit

1233
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
Encouraged

1234
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Of life

1235
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,199
You know and you can liken it to

1236
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
A flower

1237
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
That grows up through

1238
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
Cement

1239
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
How does that happen

1240
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
But how does that

1241
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
Growth of the

1242
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,903
That fragile Little Flower

1243
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
Crack

1244
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
The cement

1245
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
Above it

1246
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
This is all

1247
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
A type of

1248
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
Communication

1249
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Going on be

1250
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Between various life

1251
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:48,287
I don't know how the image of a flower growing through concrete is similar to Intergalactic laws that a life that doesn't make any

1252
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Enzymes to me

1253
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:55,455
Does that imply that there Earthbound laws that concrete must be manufactured in such a way that plants have a chance of breaking

1254
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,295
Cuz that's the parallel I would say between what she's talking about

1255
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:04,671
Bpa's gotten out of hand that's what happens when you let Scott Pruitt have it for just no

1256
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:10,303
Able to sometimes break through concrete because concrete has microscopic cracks in it already

1257
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,143
Root systems grow out there trying to find places to expand to

1258
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,679
Could be into one of those cracks

1259
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Send Isaac grows

1260
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,751
Widens and what-have-you menu

1261
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,175
If you get a professional ceiling job on your driveway you are not going to be plants coming through that concrete

1262
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,271
Mystical thing it's just a feature of untreated concrete

1263
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
Rockets kind of makes

1264
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,439
Sit down and once again like carries Creator is just kind of an idiot

1265
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
Who doesn't know how to properly seal his universe

1266
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Maybe

1267
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Yeah

1268
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:49,727
Or maybe it's stealing your driveway is cheating

1269
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,383
Elementary point

1270
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,991
Why does the universe care about favoring life

1271
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:06,879
That's the internet that was the only thing that is an interesting question for me because I know she doesn't mean it like this

1272
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
But the universe favoring life

1273
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,535
He's something of a thought experiment just because

1274
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
There should

1275
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,143
Theoretically be an equal amount of electrons and positrons

1276
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,959
That kind of

1277
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,383
There's matter and there's antimatter and they should cancel each other out I do every time so Universe should be zero

1278
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Brights but their stuff

1279
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Why

1280
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
The song of the universe

1281
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
Kind of favors life in some sort of law

1282
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,391
Entropy consistent process

1283
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,719
Everything I actually favoring towards not a

1284
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
You betcha

1285
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,815
So the universe actually

1286
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,607
Doesn't seem to favor life

1287
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,751
These are the arguments

1288
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,567
Now let me tell you about a flower I saw

1289
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
The other day

1290
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
Grew out of a black hole

1291
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
So

1292
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
When do you think covid came

1293
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
If

1294
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,575
Getting some of the information here from Carrie

1295
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
You have a lot of information from Alex already I think you were probably perfectly situated to

1296
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,767
I'm up with where it

1297
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,655
Cambridge I mean she wouldn't say Andromeda because we've already got a movie The Andromeda Strain

1298
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,191
So we wouldn't do that

1299
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
I mean

1300
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
I don't know how many other galaxies

1301
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:35,199
Are available to us exactly like what kind of what kind of level are we dealing with

1302
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
Going to go with

1303
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
Secret

1304
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,575
Dark deep State forces within our government

1305
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
I mean sort of

1306
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
Let's understand

1307
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
And it doesn't come

1308
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,487
From Donald Trump

1309
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Or from

1310
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Wuhan

1311
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
I'm at

1312
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Actually comes from

1313
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
Planet

1314
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
And from a certain

1315
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
Group of people

1316
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
Gates and

1317
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
Fauci

1318
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Soros

1319
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
Send various

1320
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
Finance

1321
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Who have been

1322
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Allow the Cheyenne

1323
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
To work

1324
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Collusion

1325
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
With the various

1326
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
Planet races

1327
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Rai

1328
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Artificial

1329
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Out there

1330
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
Better come

1331
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
2

1332
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Attracted to

1333
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Hours for Winery

1334
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Another

1335
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
Sometimes

1336
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
Very diabolical

1337
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Intentions

1338
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
I'm taking over the

1339
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Human body

1340
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
He is certainly one

1341
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
One of them more.

1342
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
I could see that

1343
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Pretty eyeball

1344
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Quite

1345
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,895
Realistically, how different is a workout at all

1346
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Yeah

1347
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:42,015
Demon is an interdimensional beings

1348
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,367
Yes I mean it's not really all that different than Alex's View

1349
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Closer to home

1350
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
I think they both just kind of mess together with the vacuole kind of brought all of the disparate elements of b*******

1351
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,119
Together underlying

1352
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,167
Fundamental similarities

1353
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Already

1354
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,495
And some some of this

1355
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Pink

1356
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
The market

1357
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,407
Probably brought them together

1358
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,503
I think Adam Smith might have been right about

1359
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
One mark

1360
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,111
The Invisible Hand is conspiracy

1361
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
Spotify

1362
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
So when

1363
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,719
MD covid agenda started

1364
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
They had one step today they wanted

1365
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Steak first

1366
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
It's not

1367
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Physical

1368
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
And therefore when they rolled out the

1369
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
The covid

1370
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Agenda

1371
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
First they wanted

1372
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Propaganda

1373
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
And use

1374
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
Beer

1375
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,335
Two of us

1376
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Large group

1377
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Patient who are

1378
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Let's say not selfish

1379
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Where

1380
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Not not really under

1381
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Understanding

1382
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
The universe

1383
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
In any deeper

1384
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
And those

1385
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Individuals

1386
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Retreated in

1387
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Interfere

1388
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
We're locked in

1389
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
Into this medical

1390
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Paradigm

1391
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:05,471
Define whatever like the media or doctor is warning people about a public

1392
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Health risk

1393
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,311
I don't think that counts as like spreading fear

1394
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,615
Some people on social media probably acted up

1395
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
And that's who I mean

1396
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
That's going to happen all the time

1397
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
Open also

1398
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,015
Really important point

1399
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,063
When you talk about spreading fear

1400
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,647
She was being boarded up in their homes

1401
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
Cobra turning them into vampires

1402
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:32,095
That would be so much more scared if I believe anything she was saying that anything I heard from the CDC okay so if I

1403
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
I recall correctly the CDC was like

1404
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
Here's what's going on is pandemic coming we know how it spreads generally speaking as far as the Matheson

1405
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,895
And there's mitigating six steps you can take in order to make things

1406
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
Marginally safer if we're smart will just shut the country down for a few weeks ride it out and then everything

1407
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Will be fine

1408
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,135
Cuz I remember that being said

1409
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,207
While that was being said

1410
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,535
I was hearing from Carrie and Alex in the lake

1411
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:06,911
That we were all going to die it's over for Humanity there'll only be lone survivors and Alex's world and

1412
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,471
The Chinese people are boarded up in their homes turning into vampire

1413
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,775
Understand this correctly

1414
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
In her memory

1415
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,663
The scaremongering swear the one saying hey everybody

1416
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,223
As long as we act smart

1417
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,527
Envy people who are smart

1418
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
Where the people screaming

1419
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:30,463
Run for the hills talk to everybody we're all going to die all overtime

1420
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
I think that's unfair

1421
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,631
Yeah it better in order to keep the business alive

1422
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Yeah

1423
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
So

1424
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,335
Christianity is a religion we know that established

1425
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,919
Siri believe the Christianity is kind of mind control

1426
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,479
Right there's somebody in control involved and one of

1427
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
The mind-control aspect

1428
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
That Christianity uses

1429
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
He's getting people

1430
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,391
I think that God is like a personified

1431
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,719
Perceptual you know just a guy in the sky

1432
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
And it's full of

1433
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Christianity's

1434
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
And this

1435
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
This is part of

1436
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
The problem with

1437
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
How

1438
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Juan community

1439
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
He's trying to reach

1440
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
Can audience

1441
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
Grew up

1442
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
With this mind

1443
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
Control

1444
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Patterning

1445
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
That has to do with

1446
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
You know

1447
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
Believing

1448
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Goddesses

1449
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
This man in the sky

1450
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,015
And that he is

1451
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Good to him he'll

1452
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
The begum

1453
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Through

1454
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
Through

1455
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
Worship

1456
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Pray

1457
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
And then he'll

1458
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,607
He'll do some good things for

1459
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
It's you know this is not how the

1460
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Brasswerx

1461
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Okay

1462
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
There are elements

1463
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
Ants that are attracted

1464
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Did you deposit

1465
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
And if you put out the

1466
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Positive

1467
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Attract apposite

1468
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,479
Will happen for you

1469
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
So

1470
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
By the same

1471
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:04,927
Is basically law of attraction chittick

1472
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
Fun

1473
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
It's it's always funny to me

1474
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,327
How one of the one of the like

1475
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Unspoken realities of religious

1476
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
Belief

1477
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
An individual acceptance

1478
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,519
Anything that anybody else believes

1479
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Is silly

1480
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
You know that

1481
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,919
She's like well obviously every molecule has a complete consciousness

1482
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
And can communicate and if you want

1483
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:32,575
If you can create rockets in your witchcraft in all of this stuff is obvious right

1484
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Just smart

1485
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
And it's Christianity s*** oh my God there's a God now there's not there's a Creator it's different

1486
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
My knee has a rebuttal

1487
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,839
Yeah

1488
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:50,495
Yeah I got to be kind of an unpleasant aspect of some religious but I don't think it's Universal

1489
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,567
Is not a lot of religious people in my life who have

1490
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Good rap

1491
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,967
Respect for people. I mean like that aspect

1492
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:06,367
The pizza people who are obsessed with the I'm right and you're wrong religion where they always look down at

1493
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
Silly things

1494
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,231
Do the scientologists believe this stuff is not that kind

1495
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
There's a feature of

1496
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,911
Kerry in her broadcast

1497
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,983
InStyle that I find very fascinating and that is

1498
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
A rank

1499
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
Lack of self-awareness

1500
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,639
This next clip

1501
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
I burst out laughing

1502
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,503
Almost as loud as I did during the George Lucas talk show

1503
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
I really would like

1504
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
It is more of

1505
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
People out

1506
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Are that are parked

1507
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
In a kind of a dialogue

1508
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
So if you have

1509
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,047
If you're interviewing somebody

1510
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
You are having

1511
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,351
A dialogue that is

1512
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
Is heard by the world

1513
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
And so it's important that interviewers

1514
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
People they're out there now too

1515
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Bring more

1516
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Intelligence

1517
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,223
And be last sort of

1518
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
Stand up

1519
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
The fanbase

1520
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
You know

1521
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
For the person

1522
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,111
They're interviewing

1523
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Maxine on

1524
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
It's more important.

1525
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
People begin to

1526
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
At

1527
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Everything

1528
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Out there

1529
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
And question

1530
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:25,215
Yeah problem with the words coming from her

1531
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Man

1532
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,383
The bullet is evolving you said the way you set it up and then she was like when you're interviewing I started laughing

1533
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,687
Figured I knew I knew I was going to go

1534
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:41,087
These interviews need to be more critical and stop acting like this and now I'm going to tell you about Mark Richardson foot and opossum

1535
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:47,487
Play Commit This murder cuz he was off-planet

1536
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:53,887
Princess but he's married to and I only tell you that because I've applied critical thinking skills

1537
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,775
Unlike all of you people were like

1538
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
Fact check this

1539
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
My butt

1540
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,407
Wow

1541
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,711
So fun

1542
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,527
Like honestly

1543
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,063
I feel like

1544
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,463
Good this kind of world that she lives it is very detached from even if you take the aliens and

1545
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,255
Stuff out of it just like conception

1546
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,815
Of how things

1547
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,119
Really actually it

1548
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
How people interact

1549
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,239
How phenomenon happen like the flower in the concrete

1550
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
2 no idea no idea that concrete

1551
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,639
And she has no idea about another thing

1552
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
About

1553
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,711
How information is conveyed

1554
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
So I got now a library of over

1555
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
Over 1,000

1556
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
Testimony

1557
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,183
From experience

1558
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Direct

1559
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
Experience of Their Own

1560
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
Embarrassed

1561
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Programs

1562
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
Through their own

1563
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Abduction

1564
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Some of this is verifiable

1565
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Some of it

1566
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Dodo

1567
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
When you get a lot of weight

1568
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
Message saying

1569
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
The same thing

1570
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
The higher-level

1571
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Verify

1572
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
Ability if you will

1573
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
What's

1574
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
And it's important

1575
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,039
Understand some people

1576
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Put down

1577
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
In reality

1578
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Witness test

1579
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Demoniac

1580
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
That often

1581
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
Let's shake

1582
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Thrown in jail

1583
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
That is

1584
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
A very

1585
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
Ciara

1586
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Part of our

1587
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,799
You know the people who say you have a problem with Whitten

1588
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
Bethesda voting

1589
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:44,223
Are also talking about how Witnesses convicted people in the justice system about how eyewitnesses

1590
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:50,623
Often are responsible for people being convicted remember clearly

1591
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,695
Constitutional rights Foundation

1592
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,535
Witness testimony accounts for about half

1593
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
Of all wrongful

1594
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
Researchers at

1595
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,679
Ohio State University

1596
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,239
The determined that roughly 52% of the errors

1597
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
Resulted from eyewitness mistakes

1598
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:15,199
Legal scholar Edwin borchard studied 65 cases of erroneous criminal convictions of innocent people

1599
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:20,063
Mistaken eyewitness identification was responsible for approximately 45%

1600
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
Abortion

1601
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
Case study

1602
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,671
Eyewitness accounts with the kind of thing that you would

1603
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
Think would be really reliable right because you're also projecting your own feelings about your purse

1604
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Options into the eyewitness

1605
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,471
If I saw it I would know what I saw obviously they know what they saw

1606
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
You got into it seems like it would be the most like solid to persuasive kind of evidence but it's not it's it's

1607
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,919
One of the least reliable

1608
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
Things until we have

1609
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Perhaps

1610
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Perfect

1611
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Example

1612
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
A perfect example

1613
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,623
Kerry Cassidy

1614
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Saying

1615
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,743
That at the beginning of the pandemic there were all these scare mongers

1616
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,535
And none of them happened to be her

1617
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,607
That's how the memory works

1618
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,447
Discrete event

1619
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,567
I mean I would say that it's more like

1620
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
She says that she can

1621
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,711
Turn street lights off with her mind

1622
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
That's been eyewitness testimony that I have to take issue a problem that is a problem

1623
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,951
People of these first-hand accounts and stuff are f****** Liars

1624
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:35,071
Morton and Mark Richards

1625
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:39,423
Fox21 way of saying if enough

1626
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,031
Witnesses are saying the same thing it's increase the possibility is to say

1627
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,079
If enough Witnesses are paid enough

1628
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,223
The same thing people that you're talking to

1629
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,807
Outright weirdos and unknown fraudsters

1630
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,599
People want attention

1631
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Be suspicious

1632
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,487
Steph Curry talks a little bit about Area 51

1633
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,815
She never was really all that into Roswell

1634
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
What cause she operated

1635
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
A growing up

1636
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:16,799
Right on her own experiences being abducted by aliens what have you

1637
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
All that into it but she's a loop

1638
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,151
Back around to this book helped the day after Roswell

1639
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,967
Right on time getting into into recommend

1640
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Wayback

1641
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
And

1642
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
We've got Corona

1643
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Corso

1644
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Really

1645
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,999
Offering up

1646
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
The idea

1647
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
That not only did they decide to

1648
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Seed alien

1649
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
Technology in

1650
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
The public Shack

1651
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Extremely well

1652
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,567
On top of it they knew already back

1653
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,383
That some of the beings they were

1654
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,687
Did not have our best

1655
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Oh boy

1656
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,343
So the book that carries talking about is the day after Roswell by Colonel Philip Corso

1657
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,671
It was not written in the 60s it came out 1997

1658
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,023
The only real reason that book got any media attention is that strong Thurman

1659
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:14,143
The formerly deeply pro-segregation Senator and chairman of the armed services committee

1660
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
Rota forward for the book

1661
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
This was because course I would been in

1662
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,263
Strom Thurmond

1663
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:23,615
From March 1963 to December 1964

1664
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:28,479
And from February 1973 to July 1970 or 1974

1665
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,295
So strong through Manu the guy and he had some respect for him

1666
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,623
Unfortunately for strong Corso ratfuck Tim

1667
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:39,487
Strom Thurmond rotate glowing forward for the book but when the book was actually released

1668
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,559
He got super embarrassed and he had to issue the following statement

1669
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:49,471
Quote I regret the forward that I wrote in comment on Colonel Corso's professional life that is now.

1670
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:53,823
Is part of a book that professes to reveal the US government's shocking UFO cover-up

1671
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:57,151
I know of No Such coverup and I do not believe one exist

1672
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Strom Thurmond

1673
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
Don't regret segregation

1674
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
Super regret

1675
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,783
Vespa

1676
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,183
Later life you might have

1677
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,279
Itsfunneh

1678
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,607
Guy who has Aid

1679
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Like

1680
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:24,031
Turned around strawderman Dover level

1681
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,847
After the time that he would have been at Roswell

1682
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,943
Working on this alien technology and the two of them know each other well enough that Corso

1683
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,223
Yeah would be able to ask

1684
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
For forwards for his book twenty years later

1685
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,879
They don't know each other well enough to know that like one of them worked with aliens

1686
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
It's it's weird

1687
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,815
Almost like that probably wasn't part of his backstory when he work for some tournament

1688
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
Maybe just like

1689
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
Came up later

1690
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
You want to write a book

1691
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:57,311
Maybe he was running out of ideas and I was trying to put somebody on his fiction book and they were like

1692
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:02,431
Interested money was like well guess what I'm a colonel and I've got an interesting life story and they're like cool

1693
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:07,039
I also read some reviews of this book that were from people who

1694
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,367
Alien Believers and UFO researchers

1695
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Other like this book

1696
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
Out-of-left-field

1697
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,255
This is not good that's nice

1698
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:22,655
That's nice even people who are pro alien think it's not great

1699
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,959
Did it strong like covering things up

1700
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
Really think that statement

1701
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,591
If you wrote the forward then that would suggest he knew what was in it

1702
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,871
Antenna

1703
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
Yeah in the book

1704
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,199
And for the cover-up to make sense

1705
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,479
He would have to

1706
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
Have Nots

1707
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
I mean it doesn't make sense for it to be a cover-up it makes total sense that this guy who has his aide asked him on the

1708
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
Understanding that it's an autobiography

1709
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,143
Book but it already written the forwards or just put it on there

1710
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,935
And then now they had to remove it

1711
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
This is

1712
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:02,591
The Occam's razor f****** test of Champions right here there's just no other explanation

1713
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,127
So look

1714
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Kennedy

1715
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
What

1716
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:09,247
Which John still president or the one in secretly

1717
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,295
The one who was president

1718
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Until he got assassinated

1719
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
Lot of people have a lot of ideas

1720
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,647
About why

1721
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,695
Kennedy got assassinated

1722
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,999
I'm still shirt

1723
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
Positive it was DiMaggio

1724
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
Well

1725
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,583
You're wrong

1726
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,119
It was somebody

1727
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,679
But it had to do with aliens

1728
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
In fact this was why

1729
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
Kennedy

1730
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Impart was

1731
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Skilled

1732
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Because she was going

1733
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:33,823
Reveal

1734
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,639
This enemy that we were dealing with

1735
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Information

1736
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
Russian I have

1737
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
From Captain Mark Ritchie

1738
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,295
Among others

1739
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
As well as

1740
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
That

1741
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
Incidents that I've been

1742
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
Historically

1743
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:52,767
Recorded

1744
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
I've been recorded without the alien

1745
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Element

1746
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,423
Alien element in those

1747
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
Is very

1748
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
Real

1749
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,287
That includes the Bay of Pigs going back

1750
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
2

1751
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
Black goo that is

1752
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,871
Is found in

1753
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
ICarly science

1754
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
Who killed themselves

1755
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
Bizarre ways

1756
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Form of Art

1757
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Human body

1758
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Which I believe

1759
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,159
Is actually going back

1760
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
To the graphene

1761
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Dockside and

1762
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,719
Similarities

1763
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,559
That black goo may I

1764
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Grady gredients

1765
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Katzkin

1766
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
The current covid

1767
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
At least some of the

1768
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
This again

1769
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,847
There's a black goo in the covid

1770
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,175
I do like it when everything just starts

1771
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,199
The pictures coming

1772
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,807
Clear man now the black goo is part of the covid thing it all makes sense out

1773
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,367
It's venom

1774
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:54,975
The black Google Now that I saw Let There Be Carnage

1775
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:01,119
So he was assassinated right because he was going to reveal that were fighting aliens wear

1776
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
And

1777
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,215
And then in the 80s there was some scientists

1778
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,055
Thunder

1779
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,895
Suspicious circumstances and that choosing the black guy who was involved with that

1780
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:19,295
This is part of the sci-fi movie where we get a montage of like pictures throughout

1781
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
American history where they're like

1782
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,135
Erase all the aliens in it

1783
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,951
Alien shaking hands with j

1784
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:32,351
Standing behind a recovery doing all that stuff like I just watched all the ER they washed all the pictures clear

1785
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:38,751
Yeah that definitely is also the part of the science fiction movie where I'm starting to get bored

1786
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:46,431
I mean I need a good hit of something I did I need you to give me a bump

1787
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,063
This is wearing off about an hour and 45 and sequence right now

1788
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,599
Let's see if we can get one

1789
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
And when you go back

1790
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Back to the Falkland

1791
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,183
Once were you find out that was

1792
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
To war with

1793
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Alien race

1794
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Over this

1795
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,327
And then you also find out

1796
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
The oil spill

1797
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
In the Gulf

1798
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Is also

1799
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Another

1800
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Attacked by aliens

1801
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
The whole thing

1802
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
And so on

1803
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
Yep

1804
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:23,296
But Goku eats the bottoms of our boats and so much more

1805
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,344
Mischievous sounding when they are evil

1806
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,160
Eating the bottoms of boats

1807
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,464
So many things that they do that the evidence of

1808
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,280
Is just kind of an inconvenience

1809
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,376
I understand that oil looks like black dude

1810
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
It does

1811
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,960
I've seen the pictures of them cleaning Birds

1812
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984
It's very VSCO

1813
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
CSS

1814
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,616
Does this mean that all oil spills are just black goo attacks from Aliens

1815
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,176
If so

1816
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,456
You're letting off

1817
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,040
Industry you're letting off the oil industry

1818
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,832
I quite nicely

1819
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
It is

1820
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
It is really fast

1821
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
Donating to me that they

1822
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
Never include

1823
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:05,024
The titans of Industry within their

1824
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,840
Conspiracy theories

1825
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:14,240
She's name but they don't know the CEO of Exxon they do was depicting over

1826
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,520
Quite recently

1827
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:26,016
Axons Embassy Ozawa love those people have been around you could have learned their names for years and they're the

1828
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:29,088
The ones who are killing everybody why are they behind the black Goku

1829
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,624
Conspiracy

1830
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,976
What's finding work with Exxon let's get all the bad guys

1831
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:40,864
Just wanted to get the oil from point A to point B

1832
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,192
But you know you got to give it up to Exxon Bay really don't work with Haley

1833
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,752
Also the Falklands War was a knot

1834
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:52,384
About alien technology.

1835
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,432
I want to say is alienate it wasn't

1836
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:59,808
No no the reason that you saying that is that there were the alien or the UFO files

1837
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,856
Slippery released by the UK

1838
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:07,232
And there's one dimension from like a memo in 1982 or something like that

1839
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
Let's sightings have gone down since the Falkland War something that's being extrapolated

1840
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Solid

1841
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Stuff that

1842
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,472
Sounds right to me

1843
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,264
So we want to split.

1844
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,640
Scary spelling out why she made this video thank God I really need an explanation

1845
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
I think it's a warning

1846
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,784
Is that what it is well that's not refusing to say but I think it was

1847
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,064
Okay I mean

1848
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
I don't be a cyborg

1849
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,184
I can I'm kind of fine with cyborg

1850
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,768
I don't know what the difference would be again

1851
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,560
Sitting here right now

1852
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,864
There is no test that I could do

1853
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,656
Prove

1854
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,008
Or disprove that I am a cyborg

1855
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,080
Possibly it would make no difference

1856
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,384
Here's a parting shot

1857
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
I think it's very important

1858
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
Humanity start

1859
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Widened

1860
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
The dialogue

1861
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
And

1862
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
This

1863
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,624
Killer video my urge

1864
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Is

1865
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
Because there are certain

1866
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
People such as

1867
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
Trump

1868
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
And 107

1869
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
To our kind of

1870
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Leading

1871
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,840
A certain portion of America

1872
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,120
Standing up

1873
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Against

1874
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
Communist

1875
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
Of America

1876
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
Standing up against

1877
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
The board

1878
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Taekook

1879
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
Of America

1880
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
That

1881
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,384
I'm trying

1882
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,664
Who's out there

1883
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
So that people

1884
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Dolemite

1885
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,528
Hoodoo follow some of that

1886
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
From Trump and

1887
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
You're one

1888
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
And the White House

1889
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,416
2

1890
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,976
You know encourage them to start

1891
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
Talking on

1892
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Hirelevel

1893
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
To stop

1894
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Dominant

1895
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Down

1896
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
Down to

1897
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
You know

1898
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Repetitively

1899
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
I have bad news

1900
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,872
The repetitive religious transfer all they're going to do that's all they want to do

1901
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,408
Their favorite thing

1902
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,944
Yeah when you want subs to

1903
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Since they don't have it

1904
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,624
Right and this isn't substance also very clear about that

1905
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,232
She has it it's it's pretty common among a lot of folks

1906
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
Like in the Trump various Trump World

1907
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Whether it's Alex

1908
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
Straight up qanon

1909
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,168
It's been read

1910
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Queen the line

1911
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
I never decided

1912
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:31,360
That Trump agrees entirely with them so crazy how it works

1913
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
He's just holding back

1914
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,480
I'm saying all the things that they believe to be true

1915
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
Because he has to in order to wait for the great reveal or whatever the day that the storm will be upon us

1916
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
They're so convinced

1917
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
Did Trump is speaking in code

1918
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,256
And signalling to them

1919
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,328
That they are now I even carry

1920
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,376
Is that a point where she's fed up with

1921
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,680
Them not coming out and just saying

1922
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Hey it's aliens

1923
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,032
Patxi's working with aliens trying to put goo in you

1924
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
Yep 2:30 would do it cyborg

1925
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,640
It's kind of sad

1926
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
It's and it's

1927
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,200
It's

1928
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
Really sad

1929
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,296
Because it's not like it's some stranger who came out of nowhere

1930
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Trump

1931
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
Has a

1932
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,880
Thoroughly

1933
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:19,488
Obscenely documented pattern of behavior that is maintained consistent

1934
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Since

1935
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
Birth

1936
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Yeah

1937
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
So every conspiracy theory ultimately revolves around him having been lying the

1938
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,032
Entire time to make up for a large amount of

1939
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:38,432
Backstory that we've got everything around there was one

1940
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,456
First Trump Tower was built

1941
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:44,576
So fun

1942
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,160
Good connection

1943
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
Yeah

1944
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,208
Yeah this is

1945
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:56,608
I would like for someone to give a unified conspiracy theory of trump

1946
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:02,496
Biography like I would really like to see someone try and thread that needle I think it would be tough

1947
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
But it would be fun impossible

1948
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:09,920
Which was which is why would be fun yeah probably I just have one thing to say I think

1949
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
I think

1950
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
That

1951
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:16,576
And this is just making a blanket statement you can take it as you will

1952
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
I think

1953
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,928
A podcast co-host and really all podcast co-host

1954
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Should be a lot quieter

1955
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:27,584
And they shouldn't interrupt anywhere near as much as they do I think it's really annoying

1956
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,656
Well I mean frankly they're just kind of

1957
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:35,520
I all too often they try to make the show about that you know and that's I think something that should change

1958
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,104
Yeah it all podcast it is time

1959
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
Bit someone

1960
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
Well I appreciate appreciate that sentiment night

1961
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,880
I hope that the world takes that to heart could be coming from a more appropriate sauce

1962
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,440
I think they should have a lot more self-awareness

1963
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,512
I think that's a big issue

1964
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:04,192
I wish you a safe trip I wish you would not

1965
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
Macron

1966
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:11,360
For a while now on holiday like Roman Holiday

1967
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:16,992
Add something oh, Chrome and holiday do we work with that

1968
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:23,392
And if she'll episode

1969
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,672
Those just a bummer

1970
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,232
Repetitive nonsense about Alex's Behavior

1971
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,280
I feel like that would have been

1972
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:35,680
Sour Spirits all around fantastic Dan you are a Kind and Generous fellow I try to do the best I

1973
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
Also

1974
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,336
The premise of the show

1975
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,224
Will be back on the other end of your vacation

1976
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,624
But until then Jordan wave website

1977

Go to bed Jordan but until then I'm really on dzx.

1978
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,328
The sex robot

1979
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
Holding

1980
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,752
Alexandra Thurston color
