00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

6
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,608
Selena took a little bit about the goings-on in the life of Austin Texas

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,984
Indeed we are flourished

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,056
And I can't stand though I do have a question

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
For you or what is your bright spot sir I was browsing around

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
Video of website

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
Peeking around poking trying to find something to cover

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
But this was a bright spot

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,000
Laura Loomer was on the other war room

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Or whatever

15
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Owen

16
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,008
You did not put Laura Loomer in the title of the video

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Do you have to refer to as

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Female journalist shows video of democratic election fraud

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
It's gotten to the point where even like

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:07,744
You can come on oh and show but you're not going in the metadata

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
Even Infowars thinks you're to talk

22
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
That's amazing

23
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Poisonous if I understand that video

24
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
32 that I skipped over

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Pictures running for office again

26
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
Yeah baby

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,968
Going to be fun midterm season heating up and it's like there's going to be

28
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,832
Some of these these weirdos can't wait

29
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
Anyway what about you as much as I enjoy

30
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
Space to harangue you with tennis

31
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
I'm going to do self it's fine I've learned to zone out

32
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
That's fine I'm just I'm just going to let you know that I'm very excited my bright spot today

33
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,712
Day is that guy album faces into the quarter-finals he's into the second week of the Australian Open

34
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
And this is exciting

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,088
Because Gael Monfils is one of the most incredible tennis players

36
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,672
He's easing I mean it's just amazing using Magic

37
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Thrilled to hear it and then tripped and then hit the

38
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Handy Switch the tennis racket to the other side

39
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Dear Lord

40
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
He's never won a major because he had The Misfortune of Being Born during the time of the three greatest tennis player

41
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Whoever live

42
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Agassi Sampras

43
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Third guy

44
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
This is his maybe best chance

45
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,624
Near the end of his career win a major final

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
Because Djokovic wouldn't get a vaccine

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
Vera was just knocked Rafa still coming hard okay

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
Don't know if he's never even made a final before so this would be exciting not least of which

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Because

50
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
If he were to do so you'll be the first

51
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Black man in Olmos

52
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,688
50 years

53
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
50 years

54
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,320
And it is been he's one of those guys who's always had the talent to do it

55
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,184
You know if you were born in an era without the three greatest tennis players of all-time sure

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
He would have had two or three people play basketball in the time of Jordan

57
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Sorry

58
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,007
You are great but f*** off yet you would have chips in other times

59
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Totally

60
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Unfortunately

61
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Let me when you figured like

62
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Between Federer

63
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Nadal and Djokovic

64
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
There are 20 major 60 total major

65
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
That's 15 years worth of Majors that are just

66
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Knocked off the face

67
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
The planet that's crazy when you stopped

68
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
To think about it we got it we got it

69
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,839
Monopolistic

70
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,703
Anyways I'm excited I hope he takes it and it's it's something I'm rooting for Harrah

71
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
Today we have to go over but it's a little off the beaten Trail not necessarily as

72
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Off the trail is

73
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Project Camelot

74
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,271
Psychic in preparation for this

75
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
But I just it wasn't good enough

76
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
I wasn't weird enough it was just like

77
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
The psychic was just saying that everyone's dead and been replaced by clone Leo Pros killed

78
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
Open 2008 has been alone ever since

79
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Sometimes there are multiple clones of people running around

80
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Psychic as much as it is

81
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Just keep Minaj

82
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
What we got going on is it at the end of last week

83
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
I'll Ted's a bit of a family court day on Thursday

84
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,695
And then Friday you'd expect you to come into the show the head of steam pretty excited for the possibilities

85
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,327
Doesn't come in on Friday of course I went Royer, comes in and does his show

86
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,471
Actually no current stuff and then on Saturday

87
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Alex dropped a little gem

88
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Right into our little plate

89
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,919
And that is a emergency Saturday broadcast

90
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,039
Right there was an emergency

91
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Do I record this

92
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
Abba

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,399
Aw thank you so much

From Algonquin Illinois

101
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
We may or may not have given this shout-out at the time but it was quite a while ago

102
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Baby

103
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
We should have been more punctual about this cuz

104
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Happy birthday Nikki

105
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Happy birthday in order of us possibly being late.

106
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Born

107
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Is the condition that leads to death

108
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
Life is a disease that ends in death

109
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Sojourn

Struggling this weekend with like I slept on my neck wrong throwing everything off

114

Like it's hard to sleep it hurts to stand up

115
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
No worries.

116
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
To be standing what do the active

117
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
It's just

118
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
It's miserable so if I'm a little wee wee football injuries to my back

In Europe

155
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023

On February 1st

157
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
But suddenly

158
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
All these

159
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911

00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
They all came outside

169
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
And said you don't what

170
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Ending

171
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
All of

172
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,719
That is an amazing way for Alex to start this show and that would be a massive news alert

173
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,071
Operates with his narrative

174
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
I think it's a huge indication that he's looking for an off-ramp from the covid Asteria

175
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Dominated the show for the last two years

176
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
I'm going to attempt to lay out the picture of what I mean by this

177
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,431
And I'm going to start by addressing the reality and falsity of the news that Alex's cover

178
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
Mostly this has to do with Boris Johnson announcing that England had reached

179
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Deacon terms of Omicron

180
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
Miami covid related restrict

181
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Go to bees

182
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
This coming Monday

183
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Granted

184
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:11,583
CBS quote the restrictions being lifted on Monday in England were some of the least stringent imposed across Europe

185
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,239
Even so this is one of the countries that Alex thinks is the most important in the world so this is a major shift

186
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,407
Wisconsin Boris Johnson says please stop paying attention to that whole party thing that I had that everybody is just not

187
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Stop

188
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,343
So Alex is reporting this as the NHS giving his advice

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Matthew Taylor the CEO the NHS Confederation the organization that represents the health care entities that provides

190
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Uses for the nhsa

191
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Images under significant pressure

192
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Even with restrictions at many people going further to protect themselves and others the number and hospital with covid is high on the number

193
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
Numbers are only going down very slowly

194
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,151
High numbers of covid patients and staff off sick has the inevitable effect

195
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Only work

196
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
The Health Service can do

197
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Including the Urgent task of making inroads

198
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Into the treatment backlog

199
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
And getting back to

200
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Performance performance

201
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
In addition Taylor encourage people to continue wearing masks

202
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Getting tested regularly taking sensible precaution

203
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,167
In addition the British Medical Association was quoted by the guardian is saying this decision was quoted not Guided by

204
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
The data

205
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,311
Also Susan Hopkins the chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency quote

206
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,687
Urge the public to take our personal Behavior seriously and use face coverings when in crowded places

207
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Among strange

208
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
There are many many cautious voices in the UK medical community and there are also many commentators who like your cell

209
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Self are pretty convinced

210
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
What's the poorest John's

211
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
The move is a calculated political one

212
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
Which is designed to save his position

213
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Well putting the public at right now

214
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,679
So you're just telling me that for the past week people within his own party of Ben

215
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Calling for him to resign and then suddenly and conveniently

216
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,359
He does the thing that other people might want that could cause a lot of controversy

217
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,943
Taking away from that store

218
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,807
Conservative parties

219
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
These restrictions lifted

220
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,255
He's convinced he's giving a concession because they have been calling for him to resign

221
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Shooting was looking really bad for him

222
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
Like the conservative MP Christian wakeford had defected to labor and David Davis before

223
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Brexit guy

224
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
Essentially equated Johnson to Neville Chamberlain

225
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,503
Wait up using the virus or the conservative I am take your pick

226
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
The Daily Telegraph reported the quote 11 lawmakers submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson

227
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
54 letters are required

228
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,559
Trigger a leadership challenge it but there might have been more that were submitted that weren't made public like he was in

229
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
In the soup

230
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Listen there's there's nothing like the thick of it to really make you appreciate

231
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
The British political

232
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Open system

233
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
The reason that the restrictions is kind of the move that Johnson was because like

234
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
You said

235
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,295
I was in trouble because BYOB parties

236
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
What time Downing and Arizona housing these people and they they they were like

237
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,839
You know I think the French aristocracy were right on and I don't think anything negative ever happened to them so let's just do the same s***

238
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Guardian points out

239
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
It's fairly safe to say that this is decision of it's based on politics not science because Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland

240
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Call keeping many of the restrictions in place

241
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Like required Mastin public transit

242
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
And in retail setting

243
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
A similar Dynamic is an effective

244
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Ireland

245
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,135
Where many settings are no longer required masks but still exist on public transit

246
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
They're going to ease the restrictions in the hospitality sector and pubs are going to be allowed to be open past 9 p.m. again so there are

247
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Some moves that they're making but also some

248
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Restrictions that are staying in place

249
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,543
Here in the United States the Supreme Court ruled the bidens vaccine or test mandate for businesses wasn't going

250
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Stand still appropriate in healthcare settings

251
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,711
In terms of what restrictions exist the CDC doesn't really set any of that

252
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,319
They give recommendations and then the actual decisions are mostly a state-by-state thing

253
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
Various states are taking wildly different approaches so I have no idea how to even address I was just playing

254
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
The United States drop the Black Sea

255
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
The craziest two words I've heard anyone say about any politics

256
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
. yeah

257
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:36,031
January 20th the cdc's website still recommends everyone over 2 years old should wear masks

258
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
The people to get vaccinated and maintain

259
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Well-maintained just

260
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Since when possible

261
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
The same state-by-state Dynamic is also true

262
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
In Canada

263
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
National rules for example non citizens who aren't vaccinated or only able to enter the country under certain circumstances

264
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Aspects of national

265
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Distraction

266
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,047
Various provinces a lot of them are actually extending covid precautionary rules

267
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,191
For instance on January 17th British Columbia's Health Ministry announced that they would extend the covid order quote

268
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
That will keep

269
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,799
Gyms and fitness center is closed and limit Gatherings at events and restaurant

270
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
In almost all Publix

271
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Meanwhile Ontario is easing restrictions gradually with businesses like restaurants and theatres being able to open a.50

272
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Capacity beginning January 31st

273
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
Then gradually heading back to normal over a matter of money

274
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
At the same time Quebec has decided to not lift

275
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
Different places make different decisions

276
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Alex Singleton on the news

277
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,495
From England that decided to characterize the entire world based on the

278
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,823
And self-preservation base decision made by Boris Johnson

279
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
There's a good chance

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
That will play to his audience

281
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
It's dumb

282
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
Putting aside the real-world for a second it's critical to understand the move that Alex is making with his narrative and how he's able to pull

283
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Pull it off

284
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
Alex has built up the image of

285
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,791
Clearly Draconian covid tyranny not only is something that's coming but something that's already here

286
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
The checkpoints the door-to-door forced vaccination

287
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
It's all happening

288
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,519
This is very sensationalize does a version of the world am to engaging with reality this way service

289
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Two important functions for Alex

290
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
First

291
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Keep his audience in a state of almost

292
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,735
Hypnotic and impotent fear where the only solution available is to sport Alex so he can save

293
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
You

294
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Secondly

295
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,599
He knows that none of these things were ever going to actually happen

296
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
There were going to be door-to-door forced vaccination

297
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,791
It really serves as a perfect horror scenario that he'll eventually get to take credit for stopping

298
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,887
Are you saying that he didn't really believe there would be Daleks with guns going from

299
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,727
Door-to-door anybody to believe that 10K well.

300
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:49,407
You get to the first hints of this from this claim at the end of the clip where Alex

301
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,247
The saying that all these countries mysteriously simultaneously made these announced

302
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
Which is obviously meant to imply that they were acting in

303
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Concert in reaction to something

304
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,439
We're just going to be claimed to be the mass Awakening that Alex has helped app

305
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
But if you look at the actual state of things that the actions of the various countries that he's referencing

306
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
What he saying isn't real at all

307
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
It dangles by the thread of Boris Johnson

308
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
Decision until very recently Alex has been calling a globalist Raider

309
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
Who pretended to be a paper in order to get elected then turned on the people

310
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
So

311
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
You can see

312
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
The

313
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
Stream over sensationalize rhetoric about like

314
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,831
Door-to-door forced vaccinations are italics we forgot I right

315
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
So easy to forget about that

316
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
It's so easy and yet

317
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Impossible I remember it on my deathbed so you have those really Extreme 2 weeks from now

318
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Really extreme things are never going to happen

319
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
And

320
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Because they're never going to happen whatever Alex

321
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Decides to take

322
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,359
Play stop it by way of his Mass Awakening

323
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
I mean he's seeing hell

324
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
So

325
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
To try to get out of this f****** meatbag letter

326
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,415
What are is going to do recent War

327
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
He's going to

328
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Present as what is the

329
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
The reason that all these countries

330
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
So why are they in

331
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Just now

332
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Because the

333
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Deaths

334
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Our way down

335
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
No

336
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Is it

337
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Because

338
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
The bureaucrat

339
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Just want to give us our

340
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Respect

341
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Because they know all over the

342
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
The world

343
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Powerful

344
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Opposition

345
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Has formed

346
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Governmental Corp

347
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Private

348
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Visual level

349
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
There was a massive

350
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Hide

351
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Resistance

352
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
But they wouldn't be able to stop

353
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
A huge tide

354
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Peaceful

355
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Resistance

356
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Majority

357
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Conservative

358
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Stories

359
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
And of liberal labor

360
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Party members

361
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
UK last

362
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Boris Johnson

363
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
And said

364
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
We can outvote

365
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
With a super mature

366
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
The same thing

367
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Still happening

368
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Canada

369
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
The same thing is now

370
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Turn the United States

371
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
I think it's a strange for Alex honestly

372
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
I don't know how he's going to explain it when there are still covid restrictions down the road

373
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
Like if all these governments figures are so scared of the powerful

374
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
He's helped inspire

375
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,039
Seems like it would be impossible for him to explain them reimposing covid measures in the future should that be necessary

376
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,183
Seems to me like an indication of a desire on Alex's part though to change the status quo of his coverage

377
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
I don't know if it's going to play

378
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Like it does seem like there's that there's a

379
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
There's something that

380
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Is underwriting

381
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Yeah

382
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
I mean

383
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,239
Because the reason that I feel that way is that he's written this fun fantasy version

384
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
End of what happened to Boris Johnson

385
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
And I guess

386
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,151
Both help with explaining be like he's a traitor part cuz I

387
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
They blackmailed him in

388
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
Conversion of it is nonsensical blackmail public everybody is

389
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Effingham be blackmailed

390
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Yeah

391
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Yeah it does

392
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
I feel like there's other ways that Alex would report stuff

393
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
If you wasn't looking

394
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Looking for like

395
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
I want to stop talking about this s*** for a while

396
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Yeah

397
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Is it

398
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,687
I mean thing about it is that it feels like he's trying to take that early

399
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
You passed

400
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Because right now what

401
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
What we're seeing

402
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Tumi

403
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Is

404
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,927
Complete abdication of responsibility from

405
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
All the people who could be taking

406
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
Right so at this point

407
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,655
They're all saying that we are simply giving up to the mathematics of human behavior

408
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Rather than any kind of intervention

409
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
To change the result

410
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
So Alex is maybe right of just saying like

411
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
If they're going to say that everything's f******

412
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Confine

413
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Then

414
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
I might as well too

415
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Clyde Weaver

416
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
And we won cuz they're capitulating in the sense that they're trying to guess like the rest of us in the same way that Alex is always

417
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Always wanted them to

418
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,488
I guess so but I still think

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
The even if

420
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
There are like massive your responsibility is going on it terms of

421
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Many state governments in terms of their responses

422
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm taking care of the public

423
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
There isn't nothing being

424
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
True you know there are still some in position

425
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
True that's right for Public Health

426
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
I don't know

427
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
It is weird

428
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Death

429
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
It's just I mean I got

430
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,440
Maybe just Alex want to win

431
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Dictate that

432
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
He much like we are

433
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
Pretty sick of him talking about f****** covid

434
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
I can imagine

435
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,264
Exhausted

436
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,384
Pointless

437
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Okay

438
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
I found this one

439
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,112
Steve Kirsch blog article for a couple days and then everyone's going to get bored of it

440
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
Yeah I'm going to need to

441
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Ukiah

442
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Constantly be on the treadmill

443
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,560
Have to be exhausted and we've got upcoming

444
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
Oath Keepers and Stewart Road s*** all of this

445
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
Is going on coming his own trial all day

446
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Why not

447
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
Declaro win

448
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
It is no longer people are pressuring me so I might as well just lift

449
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
All these restrictions Alex

450
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
I've got a lot of s*** going on right now I might as well just say at 1

451
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,648
Parallelogram

452
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
So I think Alex is like take on it is more just like

453
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
The public is woken up they're not buying the official narrative

454
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
The Publix.

455
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Buying

456
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Narrative

457
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
And we have the medical Serv

458
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Private incorp

459
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Around the world

460
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
Leading the way exposing

461
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
These so-called vaccines

462
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Gene therapy

463
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
But actually erase

464
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Your immune system

465
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Avast

466
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Majority of peace

467
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Dying

468
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Vaccinate

469
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
To put out fake

470
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Headlines of your

471
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
20 times more likely

472
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Hospitalized

473
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Do you have another shot

474
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Not true

475
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Put up fake

476
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Headlines

477
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
Ninety-nine percent of husk

478
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Fertilizer unvaccinated

479
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Versace a year ago

480
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
All of it

481
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Giant live

482
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
The private and corporate medical services aren't exposing the stuff Alex is claiming

483
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,968
That's just as cherry-picked Cadre of lunatics long time

484
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
Call Steve Kerr

485
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,856
I wanted to take a look at Alex's claim that these stats were lies though

486
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
A bit off

487
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Depending on what date is that you look at

488
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Like whatever Alex's sink according to the most recent release from the CDC or 15

489
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
Times more likely to die of covid if you're on vaccinated then

490
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
If you are

491
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
As of December 8th was a rate of about

492
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,568
2 deaths per 100,000

493
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
.47 / 100,000

494
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,296
Numbers from November reflected a 68 times increased risk of death from covid vaccination persons

495
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Compared to those who have gotten the booster

496
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
So

497
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
I don't know

498
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
20 ballpark

499
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,328
Even Alex's freedom-loving Texas state government release date of this past week that showed they quote

500
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,448
Unvaccinated Texans are 16 times more likely to die from covid related illnesses

501
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Been fully vaccinated Texas

502
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
I'm at Texas

503
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,616
This week the CDC released a finding that unvaccinated people oversee

504
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
65

505
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,736
65 and older were 49 times more likely to be hospitalized

506
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
Then people over 65 who have gotten the booster

507
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Unvaccinated people age

508
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,696
5264 or 44 times more likely to be hospitalized index made people

509
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
In the same age range

510
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
When you include all

511
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
People over the age of 18 of hospitalization rates were 16 times higher

512
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Hit me up vaccinated cohort then ended

513
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
How to claim these are fake headlines Ali Wong

514
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,080
Hotspot potatoes bearing out that you are far more likely to end up hospitalized or dead

515
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
If you're on vaccinated regardless of what age group you're in

516
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
I I just

517
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
I don't I don't know

518
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
It's it it

519
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
It's nice

520
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
But that's backed up

521
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
Buy a lot of science that we can point to

522
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
But at the same time

523
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
Man that's a f****** point of vaccine

524
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Dude

525
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm glad

526
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
I'm glad that it's true

527
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
I'm glad we got the numbers

528
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Exactly

529
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
But come on what the fuc

530
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Point of even call to get a vaccine if you don't

531
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Amici's

532
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,640
Jesus Christ right right I mean the numbers are all just like working

533
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Stop

534
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,064
Theory that leads to a bit of like an introduction of a predict

535
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
They gas-lit us with

536
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
The corporate media

537
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Wachusett

538
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Every level.

539
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
The local health

540
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
July

541
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Hairstyle fail

542
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
This is a very historic moment

543
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Across the political Rubicon

544
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Now they claim they get rid of her

545
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Is a year ago but I said they bring them

546
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
They know the opposition build to a point

547
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Defeat them

548
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
They back off

549
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
We go back to sleep

550
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Back again

551
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
That I'm pretty

552
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Here

553
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
They're going to

554
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
To do it again

555
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
But not right away

556
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,160
There's a fun story but it's all just based on things I was imagining

557
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,280
There's no indication that I can see that any restrictions our guidance has been enacted or lifted because of

558
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
Beer about being defeated by Alex has awakened Army

559
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
In fact I would suggest the only people who seem to have mold of their behavior on a fear of people like Alex or the politicians were doing

560
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Exactly what I was watching

561
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Badoo

562
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
People like to Santa San Bruno weather bread is buttered they can see that they need to cater to

563
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,784
This extreme anti-vax building block or else they have no future in politics

564
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
And then I guess there's Boris Johnson who was less afraid

565
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
How the power of

566
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,696
He was afraid of losing it

567
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Government because he got caught having parties

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Well the public was sacrificed

569
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
For the public good

570
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
The situation with Boris looks close enough to what Alex needs it to look like in order for him to write a compelling story about it so that's why

571
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
What he's doing

572
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,104
The whole world is mysteriously simultaneously dropping covid restrictions because they're worried about Alex

573
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
The truth movement being too successful

574
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
And toppling the entire globalist

575
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
It's so stupid but it's

576
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
The closest thing to an off-ramp I think Alex has seen in a long time

577
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
I don't fault him

578
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Protect

579
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Yeah yeah

580
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
This notion that they eased up the restrictions in the past when they were in danger and then tighten them up when the Patriots got complaints

581
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
It doesn't really make sense

582
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:53,216
Considering that for the last 2 years consistently and incessantly anti-vax assholes have been yelling about real and imagined

583
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Public Health measures

584
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,336
At rally school board meeting City Council meetings and of course on Alexandro

585
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Gun shows

586
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,176
There was no time when the anti-vax assholes Geico

587
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Complacent

588
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Constant barrage

589
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Entire time

590
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,112
AMV idea that these covid restrictions are being just drop simultaneously

591
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Alex says England

592
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
That's about it

593
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
The rest of the country singer named don't even actually

594
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Support the argument

595
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
And even then

596
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,864
There a ton of countries in the world that he's just ignoring it

597
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Pretending don't exist

598
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
Index on the financial times

599
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,544
Nearby Oxford a researchers at Oxford

600
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Anything strange at the index

601
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
Pics of government

602
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
Government measures

603
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:45,440
Walking in early this year at 43.5 to on my scale this is on January 15th

604
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Emily jump

605
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,024
61.11 on January 8th

606
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Wow

607
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Yeah that's like

608
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Go to a party you lose your

609
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:01,056
Yeah they had to postpone impeaching a president do to covid-19

610
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
That's a good that's a good sis

611
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
Well they're not forcing anybody to get it they are launching door-to-door vaccination campaigns in order to make the shots available to anybody

612
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:16,160
It also came out this week that many albanians were no longer allowed to enter Kosovo as they had enacted new rules where you needed

613
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,744
You have proof of getting the booster or current PCR test across the border

614
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
This weekend Kosovo enacted new rules regarding entry and they also said a curfew and restricted restaurant hours today

615
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Needs to be closed by 9 p.m.

616
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
Also in their new rules quote

617
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,592
All employees of public institutions Central and local public Enterprises

618
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,920
Private businesses organizations as well as other entities

619
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,504
Must possess one of the following in order to be allowed to enter the work premise

620
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
A gun

621
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,904
No proof of vaccination or proof that they have a contraindication that makes them exempt from vaccinations

622
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
Also Master required all over the place

623
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
Also this last week

624
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584
Please put in a new rule the people who wanted to enter the country

625
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
We need to purchase travel insurance

626
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
To help offset the covid cost

627
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Overtreatment Sandlot

628
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Expenses for people who need

629
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Quarantine

630
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
Alex should consider this a major move

631
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
But he seems to not care

632
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,712
At least partially because the story doesn't fit his current narrative about this suspicious drop of all covid

633
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
How restrict

634
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
In Alex's defense

635
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
He could not to point

636
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,856
He could not point to where any of those countries are on a map

637
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Probably not

638
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,672
But maybe maybe want to go to Europe

639
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
How about that loves Europe

640
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Go to Germany

641
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,096
Play some Alex has routinely said his deceit of the New World Order cuz of Angela Merkel

642
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
Seventh grade choir negative covid test

643
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Restaurants

644
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,920
The rules also continue to policy restricting people who have not been vaccinated from attending gather

645
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
But stay in urine

646
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Emily just

647
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Titans are rules

648
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
About where I where you will need a green pass to enter

649
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
It was announced on January 20th

650
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
Have to take effect in February and last until the end of March

651
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,584
And will now of this past go to a Barber and Beauty Salon

652
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,936
And this is also in addition to the places you already needed one like

653
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
Public offices Banks

654
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,568
Some post offices are you don't need one at Aaliyah's gummy party

655
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
That's true

656
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
Stop

657
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,064
Let's also check out grease and learned about how they've elected to keep their current covid restrictions in place

658
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
And what's this

659
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Find the elderly

660
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
On January 17th Greece announced that they were going to start

661
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:31,584
Finding people over 60 who haven't been vaccinated 50 Euro Mom God I love Greece

662
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,424
I f****** love that s***.

663
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
Finding Daddy for not being vaccinated

664
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
That is

665
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,616
F****** great this was this last week I love it in the same time when I love it

666
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
Everybody's dropping all the restrictions percent chance they won't come collect on that but just that they would

667
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
F****** put that out there

668
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Love it

669
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Let's not let's go a little bit towards towards the east find Turkmenistan just put some new restrictions

670
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,536
Tire place on January 16th which included quotes

671
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
Stepping up enforcement of mask-wearing

672
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,424
Restrictions on businesses and something else should be deeply concerned about

673
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,032
What are the new rules says quote the doctors nurses and medical students are to be assigned to

674
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Control points on highways

675
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
At the boundaries between Regional centers and District

676
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
To carry out

677
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Enhanced check I f****** love it

678
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,528
Goddamnit what is East Berlin just had a bunch of weirdo.

679
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,392
Stares at the border putting up the the

680
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Start a roadside checks that Alex has been obsessed about forever

681
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
I would be pleasantly surprised if there was a roadside check those like you doing okay man

682
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,240
Right diesel there's other examples but I think the point is clear

683
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,104
Alex's world use very narrow and predominately just involves countries that he thinks are white

684
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,248
There's a ton of varying responses to covid in different countries because these different countries are facing different out brake pads

685
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Engagement with the world is to skim the story about Boris Johnson makeup a fun story about it then use that story to character

686
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
Tries the situation in the entire world

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,864
The globalist are super afraid of Alex's buddy so they're loosening up a code restrictions except for all the places

688
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,216
But they are loosening restrictions and they're actually adding new ones which I was just ignore

689
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
The larger point is nothing Alex's saying is in anyway connect

690
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
The reality

691
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
He's predicting they're loosening up

692
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
Restrictions imposed

693
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,040
Because I think he probably realizes on some level that based on the anti-vax forever and

694
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Complete responsibility or public officials are showing

695
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
There's probably going to be another crisis

696
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
Before this is all over

697
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,256
This isn't laying the groundwork so things get out of control again

698
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Partially thanks for the bulshit he's spreading

699
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
Public Health measures that are being discussed are actually is a further attack on free

700
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Freedom in the Patriots

701
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
The circular are the circular game is getting really old

702
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
It's it's a little bit like

703
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,760
Predicting the financial crash after 2008 and you you watch all that stuff happened and then they were like

704
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
What if we did nothing about it and you're like okay will eventually it's going to happen if

705
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
In the same way as like

706
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Hey you know theirs

707
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Mutation

708
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Covid

709
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,304
Like you know if you don't do anything about it they'll probably continue doing that

710
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Predicting another mutation

711
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
And it's not a

712
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Difficult

713
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Thing to do

714
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
But it's it's it's actually you're wrong

715
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
They're making these diseases in life

716
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
I wish I wish that

717
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
The globalist have enough of

718
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
The public

719
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Want to have vaccine

720
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
And and want to have social

721
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
But they have now

722
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
Twenty 30% they need

723
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
The beta test the social

724
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Credit score

725
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Work out the Kinks

726
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
And get it ready

727
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Plandemic

728
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
He's been saying okay

729
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
This plandemic sending

730
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
But a new one

731
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
Coming soon one another

732
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
A virus pop

733
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
And he

734
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
DiCaprio in Olive

735
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Show you

736
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Coming out of the

737
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Jungle Juice

738
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
The world

739
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
You're going to die of a noose

740
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Super virus

741
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Hamburger

742
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Are you have a car

743
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Are you at

744
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Heating and Air

745
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Vudu

746
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Nelder cooking

747
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
This garbage

748
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Open labs

749
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
Let me go to the most telling Dynamics they really indicates

750
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
To be that Alex's knowingly Fellowship

751
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,400
About pretty much everything you talked about is this selective ability to understand things are inter

752
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Connected

753
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Princeton's when it comes to bring up his conspiracies

754
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Everything is connected

755
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
In far-flung Industries

756
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,944
In different countries living at different periods of time they're all working together for the same goal

757
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,296
Even more to the point he understands the trends can have an impact on other trends

758
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
For instance economies in the developing world wars and the impact of negative effect on the supply chain ultimate

759
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
Dab affect our economy

760
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Alex gets this kind of interconnected

761
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,168
However when it comes to the relationship between deforestation and disease he pretends

762
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Ensenada understand what people are talking

763
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,080
They're animals and he quoted jungles to use his term that we aren't in contact with him

764
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,432
When their habitats are destroyed some of them made migrate into where humans live

765
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
In some of these animals may carry diseases we've never encountered

766
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,808
Before and we may be super susceptible to

767
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Pretty pretty simple under

768
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Understand dynamic

769
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
Pretty well understood how

770
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Climate change and the destruction of natural environment like Forest

771
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
Is closely associated with

772
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Disease

773
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,864
This isn't even taking into consideration the dynamic we're like

774
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:26,496
Why she eating bacteria can only survive in warmer water is so as the temperature the oceans increase in your chance

775
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
Encountering it would go for a swim

776
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Has going up

777
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
I do believe that our to be capable of understanding interconnect

778
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Missing one instance and not in

779
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
In the other

780
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
It seems to me like a pathetic

781
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,040
Display of willful misrepresentation in order to misinform the audio

782
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Also

783
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
I love

784
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,928
Bill Gates Leonardo Dicaprio and all of them

785
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:51,840
Don't you worry what a group Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio simultaneously came out with all of them

786
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
NSAID

787
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,472
That f****** jungles man who are the rest of them

788
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
I mean I understand that Leonardo DiCaprio was like

789
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Michael Shannon

790
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Well I mean he's definitely in there

791
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Probably

792
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,040
I spell Hamburglar buddy

793
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
How dare you

794
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,184
I think I know that Leonardo DiCaprio was involved

795
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
In that 77

796
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
07 concert

797
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Worldwide Coronavirus

798
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,680
It's like a few times Leonardo DiCaprio has been like hey how about the environment maybe let's not

799
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,728
Destroy it on his giant f****** yacht

800
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Bears

801
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Yeah I don't know I guess he is

802
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,384
He's going to pretty soon be called Bill Gates Nuevo

803
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
Puppy gets into the council at 12:10

804
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
@aoc

805
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
All the Hollywood

806
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Would trash like

807
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Aforementioned

808
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
DiCaprio

809
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Telling you

810
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
That it's imminent

811
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
They're almost all of us

812
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
Shuffle.

813
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
William Shatner

814
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Gets off the spaceship

815
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Few months ago

816
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Thesis

817
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
Too bad everyone will be dead on the surface

818
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
44 fall right

819
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
They have let all these p

820
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
In on the depop

821
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Hell they look

822
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
The public

823
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
They got walls

824
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
New York Times

825
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Looking forward

826
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
To the end of

827
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Humanity

828
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
Representation of what Shatner said

829
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
When you get back

830
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,304
I was overwhelmed with the experience

831
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Sensation of looking at death and looking at life

832
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,984
And this you know what has become cliche over how we need to take care of the planet

833
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,824
But it's so fragile people say oh it's fragile no no no

834
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
There's this little tiny blue-skinned that is 50 miles wide and we pollute it and it's our means of

835
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,808
So I mean mischaracterization

836
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Entitled look

837
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
Forward to the end of humanity wasn't about how we're cursing need to go

838
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,072
Piscifun misrepresentation Alex can make because he only engages with headlines and he likes to pretend that looking

839
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
Forwarded this case

840
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,936
He's like how a kid looks forward to a birthday party as opposed to looking

841
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,264
Forward in terms of thinking about the things in the future

842
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
The article itself is really mostly about how if the ability to download your brain into a robot does come over

843
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Like that

844
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,320
There's a really good chance that it's only going to be available to people in the upper echelons of society and that's a nightmare

845
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
The last line of the pieces quote

846
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,536
Transhuman future in which mortality is optional may sound like paradise but if it come sooner for some of us than

847
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Them for others

848
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
It could prove to be a dystopia

849
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
This is almost two-year-old opposite Alex only knows the headline of using to argue that the globalists are planning to

850
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Wipe Out the population

851
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
It is just embarrassing

852
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
After the people saying they like a o c and Beto commenting on.

853
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
2018 ipcc report

854
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
And it was

855
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
Too much them saying that everyone's going to die

856
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
Princeton's aoc's comments were taken out of context

857
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,512
Just pointing out how the younger generation see governmental in action

858
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Quotes

859
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,352
The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change

860
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
And your biggest issue is how we going to pay for it

861
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
You see what the account

862
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
The only person

863
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:15,872
I consistently see going on and on about how everyone is about to die is Alex Jones

864
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
What is in a bad mood we're all already dead

865
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
When he's in a decent mood

866
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:25,088
It's just people that got vaccinated they're going to be dead in the next few years and he's very sorry to have to report this music

867
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,440
He's the one doing The Sensational sheet music using folox sure

868
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,256
Nonsense I know you are but what am I

869
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,120
Is the end the end of humanity their Longview Lone Survivor

870
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
All the people on the left

871
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Sensationalize

872
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,384
That's the main issue all of us Lone Survivor going to be real bummed out by their negative Nelly bulshit

873
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
I'm saying that's the problem

874
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Yep

875
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
Yeah it's it's a

876
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
It's annoying

877
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Yes that's what I would say

878
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
So course

879
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,488
Operation lockstep comes up and Alex lies about that document a little

880
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
But the good news is

881
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
If you read the Rockefeller build

882
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
They plan to have the

883
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
First phase lockdown

884
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
4 years

885
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Then pull it off early

886
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
Bring it back

887
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
That is good news

888
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
This time after

889
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
2 years old

890
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
Form Soma Chiapas

891
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Position

892
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
That attracts

893
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Bring down their whole system

894
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Getting off now

895
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Again

896
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Go away

897
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
And then they can move

898
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Text weapon

899
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Cyber attack

900
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Sure

901
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Telegrafi

902
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
That's why we've

903
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Stay vigilant

904
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Focus

905
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
That's why we've got a bra

906
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Bring to Justice

907
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
All the liars

908
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
During this entire process

909
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Like fauci

910
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
And others.

911
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Purposely lied about the

912
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Oh

913
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Statistics are going to jail Alex

914
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
And his entire crew are all getting locked up

915
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Jail people for lying about

916
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Statistics are the people currently lying about statistics

917
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,767
Yes so then yeah

918
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
Decent almost cautious pick for him

919
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,007
There's a pretty high likelihood of something happening that he could portray the Cyber false flag

920
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,823
So his odds of getting to portray himself as a prophet

921
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,407
For just making a bland middle-of-the-road protection up pretty good here

922
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
Always growing

923
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
People are engaging with NF

924
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,855
Do you have that sort of thing these days leave the door wide open for something to happen on that front

925
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,439
What's the could wipe out a ton of money which I would call the Cyber false flag

926
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
If you could just call the drop in Bitcoin

927
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
Price if you if you really start digging into how big of a problem ransomware is starting to become a

928
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
It's like a little boy

929
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,055
These are all possibilities that would not need to be false

930
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Oddities already

931
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
Primed the audience to experience that way

932
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,967
But it gets even more flimsy because we've played this game already

933
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,599
In February of last year Texas got hit by that massive winter storm that knocked out power to a lot of people

934
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,975
That was the result of poor oversight by the electric reliability Council of Texas or not

935
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
I am faulty infrastructure

936
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
Largely due to Texas's

937
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,727
Strong distaste for regulation it's a good thing that after that crisis happened they really mobilize

938
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:28,127
Regulations

939
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:37,087
Voluntarily pay for it out of the goodness of their hearts especially if they had downloaded their brain into an immortal cyber

940
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
They would

941
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Really care a lot about you

942
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
That power crisis a cyber false flag

943
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
This is the kind of standards

944
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,839
He's going to need the claim that he's right about the

945
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
This prediction

946
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Almost a non-existent

947
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,287
It's like a limbo bar the top of a doorway

948
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,359
There are really serious winter storms that have been happening

949
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
And are predicted to through the weekend in places like North

950
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,455
South Carolina

951
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,783
Much of South Texas is under a winter storm warning

952
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:12,415
The point is that their number places that aren't necessarily known for their tough winter weather that are looking at

953
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Some challenges

954
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,535
And it may just be that another city loses power temporarily due to a snowstorm

955
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:23,167
I was just cyberpunks like prediction is attempt to get ahead of that possibility so he can profit off it

956
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
If it does come

957
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
Come to pass

958
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
That's all that's going on there

959
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
I mean I think my

960
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
My big

961
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,359
Biggest problem with all of these doomsday predictions is that

962
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
Quite simply due to the behaviors of

963
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
The far-right

964
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,367
Extreme weather events in destabilization are almost guaranteed so predict

965
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Getting them now is

966
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,999
Is frustratingly easy like you guys made it so you could be right

967
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
Like everytime you predicted

968
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Ship before you were wrong

969
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,143
Stabilize the world so much

970
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,751
Gold might be going up to levels that he was talking about

971
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:05,151
I don't know it's annoying

972
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
Down is, that's completely made up and what this lie is meant to do is convince the listeners that the actions taken by Alex in the

973
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Anti-vax community

974
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
We're not only righteous

975
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
But they were also super effective

976
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
That's an attempt to one

977
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Plane Victory and to

978
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,631
Solidify the argument that if Public Health measures are raised against than this kind of ridiculous responses exactly what everybody

979
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
Needs to do cuz it work this time

980
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Yep I have time

981
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
How to make buddies were able to

982
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,287
Defeat the globalist in 2 years where is that

983
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,615
Globus plan was for obviously

984
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
How's the weather on the subject of how weak are these globalist

985
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:44,831
If their plan is either imprison the entire world or kill everyone off and they're doing it because they're beholding

986
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:51,231
Too literal Satan how does it make sense that they would back off because Alex and his friends were whining for a long time

987
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
God is behind their whining then

988
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Nah

989
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
Handlebar liners who wind themselves

990
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Because it's just

991
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
The made-up story that I was telling political decision

992
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
BYOB parties

993
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
Has a second

994
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,647
In the beginning of this piece

995
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
Prominently all

996
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,279
The only Solid Ground he really has to stand August Boris Johnson thing

997
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
But he has a second piece that comes up

998
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
It's very dumb

999
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
There's another

1000
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Short clip

1001
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
The Bill Maher show

1002
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Dot-com

1003
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Showing a Libby

1004
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
New York Times columnist

1005
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Coming out in

1006
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
Calling to covid

1007
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Tyranny

1008
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Catastrophic

1009
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Moral

1010
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Slime

1011
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
It was all a fraud

1012
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
Is Barry Weiss going on Bill Maher show

1013
00:46:55,231 --> 00:47:01,375
Fairly certain I called her a fascist to someone she works with

1014
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,215
I think her career trajectory

1015
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Has been such

1016
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,799
That I would never call her a liberal

1017
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
I wouldn't call her on the left

1018
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
Oh no she was

1019
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,735
Very essential in whitewashing and promoting

1020
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
The

1021
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,855
Quote-unquote intellectual dark web

1022
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,695
Anti cancel culture University arrival

1023
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
It's ridiculous

1024
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,863
And if you really go through her columns in the New York Times I feel like she's an aspiring slave owner

1025
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,263
You know like somebody is really going to work her ass on one of her co-workers is going to get mad at you.

1026
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,407
We're going to care about what people on Bill Maher show say figure out why Alex likes to pretend

1027
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,479
I don't know if I had to guess I would say it's because the show is

1028
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:52,063
Like it's really intentionally iconoclastic and it's

1029
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
Supposed to involve comedy

1030
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Sort of shore sometimes people say things that are B inflammatory or at least more so than you'd see on a regular news program

1031
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
Because people speak so loosely at something

1032
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:08,191
Versed is a joke Alex comments people make on their present them as if they're the gospel of the globalist

1033
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
My best guess

1034
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,359
Whatever the reason it's just such a bizarre inside trend on Alex's show where he thinks that the globalists are speaking

1035
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
Cancer Bill Maher show

1036
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
Except that Alex likes Manuel has been a secret Patriot this whole time

1037
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
Man I can take it off

1038
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,879
I think the thing about

1039
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,487
Bill Maher show is that there are no relevant political late night shows

1040
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Anymore

1041
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Like it just doesn't

1042
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
Exist and Bill Marek

1043
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
Guess was relevant 20 years ago

1044
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
So that's like a

1045
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,007
Alex's mind is the last time something was relevant

1046
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,079
Last time I watched it I was when I was 50

1047
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,431
Righto maybe my memories are a little bit shaded but I

1048
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,479
Seem to work all Politically Incorrect

1049
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Being like

1050
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,831
At least a little bit more interesting than his current show

1051
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231
Maybe we were all just wrong cuz we didn't know

1052
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,047
SNL was good when we were fifteen that happen

1053
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
We both live through it yeah

1054
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Yeah it's it's strange

1055
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
I don't I don't know

1056
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
I just I'm so bored

1057
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,847
Of pointing to a Bill Maher can't believe anybody still has the time 4

1058
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:25,247
Who has the time for it so f****** watches that show

1059
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
Tom Kenny

1060
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
He's fine

1061
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,279
So I was just like a I had a terrible Flash

1062
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
You said Tom Kenny

1063
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Not because of anything about him

1064
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:46,495
Because now I have to go through my mental Rolodex of like have I heard something bad

1065
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
Storm the capitol

1066
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
SpongeBob cause problems

1067
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
I was looking around like I was on Twitter

1068
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Abducted

1069
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
F****** 5 foot 10 and he's white dude from the 90s

1070
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
3 of a great game you have it something I did

1071
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
Tom Kenny

1072
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
He's okay

1073
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
He still good

1074
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
Alex has been Vindicated

1075
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
Predominately because Barry Weiss was talking s***

1076
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Yeah it was a lonely place

1077
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Months ago

1078
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
It's been a rough process

1079
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
Fastest route it but I knew

1080
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
The Infowars axes

1081
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Information Warfare

1082
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Shock troops

1083
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Uproot

1084
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
And it's our job to

1085
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
Tell the hard facts

1086
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Upfront

1087
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
Not popular

1088
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
The public is it

1089
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Fort

1090
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Because if

1091
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
We don't

1092
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,167
Play out these hearts

1093
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Facts

1094
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
Nobody else

1095
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,495
That's why all of you

1096
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
You watching all of you

1097
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Do you understand

1098
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Valuable

1099
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Infowars

1100
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
In the last 2 years

1101
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
Fighting with us

1102
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
All the things

1103
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Shredder art

1104
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Spider videos

1105
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Had to share so many

1106
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Great Patriots in

1107
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Information

1108
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
Joe Rogan coming out against it

1109
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Tucker Carlson coming out against it

1110
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
Nothing about a year to get going on

1111
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Once I saw the facts

1112
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
They did

1113
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
Wow that is the most narcissistic thing I've heard since I watched that Barry Weiss

1114
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Clip

1115
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:28,127
What is particularly interesting about this is this doesn't sound like somebody who thinks they're going to be gone in a in a month

1116
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,455
Mother to preparing for some

1117
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,503
Tamara.

1118
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
That is true

1119
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
Is it busy

1120
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,879
If you still was in sort of a mindset of like

1121
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,695
Doom is around the corner then it would be like

1122
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
I will

1123
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,559
I have been Vindicated in a pond I will write bye-bye

1124
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,399
My tails on the wall in blood

1125
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,727
He'll be something far more

1126
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,519
I don't know h

1127
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,591
Just it has it has a tone that's different from

1128
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
Maybe some of his other previous

1129
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:07,039
Works yeah I mean maybe just took a day off you needed a day off and now he's back in the playoff everyone

1130
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
The family court

1131
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
Brightwell

1132
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,719
I don't know it does feel like he wants to lay some groundwork

1133
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
And I don't like

1134
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,327
No battery

1135
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,351
Yeah that sucks

1136
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:27,007
It's also if you kind of cut through the facade in that last clip what Alex is saying here is that he saved the World by state

1137
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,823
Taking the Gap at forcing out the truth until it became acceptable

1138
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,223
For other people to join him like Tucker and Joe Rogan who are apparently too cowardly to do so previously

1139
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
Work for Alex

1140
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:43,391
You would never have heard Barry Weiss go on Bill Maher and Tyson bulshit that's a win

1141
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,487
Alex's pretending that he saved the world but nothing in the world is actually change

1142
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:52,095
Other than Boris Johnson's decision in Barry White's one of Bill Maher's show and talk s***

1143
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:57,471
That's all it behind Alex's navel-gazing about how he's a hero because he was into the anti-vax yet

1144
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Before it was cool

1145
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,055
Save the world's trash he saved the world

1146
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,407
The materials that Alex uses to make his argument this video are lies about statistics

1147
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,199
Why is my block step documents

1148
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Some comments Barry Weiss made

1149
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
Boris Johnson

1150
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
A video of Robert Kennedy Jr

1151
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
And a story about Aaron Rodgers

1152
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
None of this means anything

1153
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,951
That's not a great list

1154
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Snow

1155
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:25,375
No no I wouldn't want that one on my like PhD thesis that wouldn't go well

1156
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
We got some more lies about lockstep

1157
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
Locke supplies

1158
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
Globalist are the criminals

1159
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Or desperate because of

1160
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
Nationalism

1161
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Trumpism

1162
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
And populism

1163
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
And people waking up

1164
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
So

1165
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
The Rockefeller Foundation always said nombre

1166
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
Breaking lockstep

1167
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
11

1168
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
But they would launch

1169
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
A virus cure

1170
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
To bring in

1171
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
The tyranny

1172
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,975
The overnight doesn't mean

1173
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
That

1174
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
That

1175
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
We're starting

1176
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
So incredible

1177
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
I was starting to win now yeah

1178
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
And then we were all dying but we're heating up

1179
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:15,039
How to make an all this s*** up about this Rockefeller document and it's so funny

1180
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
You're wrong this time

1181
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,671
You can hear this clip of the way that Alex tries to play non-committal with this s*** like your

1182
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Frustrated by

1183
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
Victory but

1184
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,887
Then I what nothing actually happens he runs the risk of his listeners being like hey you said the globalist are backing off

1185
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
That's why he needs a reminder that there's a good chance that nothing is going to happen and things are still going to be bad but

1186
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
While maybe a death

1187
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,063
The flimsiness of the information that Alex is providing and the

1188
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,879
Sort of ambivalence that you see

1189
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
It was traded in this club

1190
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:59,071
That's the things that kind of make me feel like what we're actually seeing is more just an indication of Alex's mood turning a little bit

1191
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Whitmore Manor

1192
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
That's kind of the

1193
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
The feeling

1194
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,239
Yeah that's that's

1195
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
All the News That's fit to print

1196
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,871
A 7 out of 10 today

1197
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
So

1198
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
I think that it would be fair to

1199
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,343
Special report after this point is

1200
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
Is it pretty positive

1201
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Pretty much like

1202
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
All the way

1203
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:30,047
All the world are dropping their covid restrictions

1204
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,583
That I know fills with white p

1205
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,679
And even those aren't but they might as well

1206
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Sure

1207
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Oh

1208
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,311
Because we're about 20 minutes at the report now

1209
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,871
Cigarettes

1210
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Bring in the new system you got to crash

1211
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
The old system

1212
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,711
And the Davos group

1213
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
IE the Bilderberg Group

1214
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
Telegraphing

1215
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
But that's their next phase

1216
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,159
They're also telegraphing they're going to have carbon locked

1217
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,071
Take down their virus

1218
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
Dino folks are aware that stamps they're going to back off on that

1219
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
Only launched a bunch of Nuit

1220
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
As much good news is I gave you earlier

1221
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
Quote you need to get ready

1222
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Prepared

1223
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
To get right with God

1224
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
You have a self-defense

1225
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Flan

1226
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
Affordable food near that water

1227
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Oppression you have neighbors

1228
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
And friends that are awake

1229
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
You know what's going on

1230
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
Gaba Mutual

1231
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
Aid agreement

1232
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
To take care of each other

1233
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
With what's coming up

1234
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,303
You'll need those neighbors for a source of food and Chase

1235
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,935
Things go bad got to eat their ass is so f****** whiplash

1236
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:46,335
Defeated the Great

1237
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,455
We have defeated the bad guy

1238
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,527
Worse things are happening at great man that cool

1239
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
Thanks dude

1240
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
I just think that this is that

1241
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,791
Tizen release balance that we see with Alex all the time it's like a victory but not really cheap

1242
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
Now that your hopes are up

1243
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,191
Yeah it's emotional manipulation

1244
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,775
But I will say I'm glad that Alex at least

1245
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
Glad Alex says this I don't really care

1246
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
Not when the offense

1247
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Violence

1248
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
Arrest all of Congo

1249
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,039
You could Fire by the just

1250
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
You could change all the judges

1251
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
But unless

1252
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,695
We become aware of the globalist

1253
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
The big Corporation

1254
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,023
Manipulating our country against each other

1255
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Will never fix

1256
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,583
Cities

1257
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
Our counties are states back

1258
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
Nations back

1259
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Take

1260
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
We've got to take our

1261
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Our lives back

1262
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
And then we have a chance

1263
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
Beating this peacefully

1264
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
Buy a global

1265
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Awakenings

1266
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
The globalist

1267
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
104

1268
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
Regional conflict

1269
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Fights

1270
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
And Civil War

1271
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
Further destabilizing

1272
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,111
Crash confidence in system

1273
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
To go down all at once basic

1274
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
To bring in their new

1275
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Global corporate governance

1276
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
That's why they're racing the

1277
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Get there

1278
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
Social credit score

1279
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,399
Vaccine passport app Stan

1280
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Back is a new day

1281
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:23,103
Such a great representation of had nothing Alex's means anything or even is internal consistency

1282
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,735
He simultaneously saying they're replacing every member and Congress and every judge wouldn't fix anything.

1283
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
But somehow the solution is a bizarrely vague notion of quote taking our cities or countries are states back our nation

1284
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
What is he

1285
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:45,631
Replacing every member of the government would do anything but instead what you have to do is gradually take back these government office

1286
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
This is like what it what does it mean

1287
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,471
It makes no sense unless you understand

1288
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
Taking back our cities and states

1289
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,359
It's something that's done outside of the electoral process

1290
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
So that's a little

1291
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:03,551
Fun subtle message corporations back most I think he just said that as part

1292
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,135
His his thing but the more I think about it like Alex

1293
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,255
What do you think that would look like right under your

1294
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:16,607
A control a common

1295
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,703
We need to nationalize the means of production

1296
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,359
That was also says the globalists are racing to get their social credit score in place by way of vaccine passports

1297
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:32,223
But this whole report was predicated on the idea that because of the massive push back to Alex's help Foster

1298
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,319
All of these countries were simultaneously dropping all covid restrictions and backing off

1299
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:42,719
These things are nonsensical right now but they're still holding them over your shoulders like

1300
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
I'm going to get you

1301
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Alex's

1302
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,071
Extemporaneous speech is full of contradict

1303
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:50,399
Because details and reality honestly just don't matter to him

1304
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,935
He's basically just trying to fuc

1305
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
With the listeners feelings at this point

1306
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,543
The only real point is making is once again

1307
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,407
Trying to make sure that no one blames him for any possible right-wing anti-vax terrorism in the future

1308
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:07,295
It's really strange Alex hasn't brought up that his former guests to the the head of the proud boys a militant arm

1309
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
The Fraternal Order of the old night

1310
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Based Stickman AKA Kyle Chapman

1311
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
Who recently arrested for allegedly attacking healthcare workers in Idaho

1312
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
There's that other guy who attacked vaccination that vaccination site in California but that dude wasn't a regular passed gas 20

1313
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,519
Alex knows that the level of tension is rising to a point where more attacks on vaccinations providers

1314
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,383
It's not out of the question doesn't want to be in trouble when that does happen or could happen

1315
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
He wants to be

1316
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
Be able to profit off them

1317
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
So that's how we Act

1318
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:41,855
I wonder if I wonder if it if it is the Infowars office they have like a

1319
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Not March

1320
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Nesper like

1321
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Almost a ton

1322
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Do you know of like

1323
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,607
Which of these people is going to go to jail and whomever is the last

1324
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,679
SWAT man

1325
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,495
You have that kind of a gambling pool

1326
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:04,895
Based Stickman 4 payout odds

1327
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,367
I didn't think that would be kind of a member of the. Of

1328
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:19,231
What time when based Stickman was coming on Alex's show and I would turn it on

1329
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:24,095
What is happening now it's like oh well basic man was

1330
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:30,751
Provocateur

1331
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,799
Lightning based stickman on your

1332
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,103
What else do you have

1333
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
You've got it you got it

1334
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,479
Kevin's just smash it

1335
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
I

1336
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:46,623
It was a simpler time

1337
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
Haha what those were the days

1338
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:53,279
Was going to cover

1339
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:00,191
They just give you the second Barry White's was to

1340
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Awakening

1341
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Victoria Secret Ed razek

1342
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,311
Right now you're all going to die

1343
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,359
So the second narrative is about

1344
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
Russia and Ukraine

1345
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,455
Third is about a prediction

1346
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
But Alex has about winter

1347
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,319
Season 3 big news story

1348
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,623
Imma give you this this one pretty

1349
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Quick

1350
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Because

1351
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,999
Alex's just saying with Russia and Ukraine

1352
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
That no matter what happens Russia is the good guy

1353
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
That leads me

1354
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Chili's

1355
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
Horse right here

1356
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
Giant palette

1357
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
Billions of dollars

1358
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
Semantics

1359
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Muscles

1360
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,823
Anti-aircraft missiles

1361
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
You name it

1362
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
Delivered

1363
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
Having put on the US state

1364
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
Twitter website

1365
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Masses

1366
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Of us

1367
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
And NATO troops

1368
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,623
Forming all around the borders

1369
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,415
Will Ukraine

1370
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,231
Y'all telling you that Russia

1371
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
What is eminently about

1372
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Invade

1373
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
Reason Russia's building trips up

1374
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
Is Lacey

1375
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
The buildup of

1376
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
The West

1377
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
Russia doesn't have a history

1378
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,007
Since the early 1980s

1379
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:12,639
Strange Donuts

1380
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Hey

1381
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:26,719
Can't argue with that

1382
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,839
Alex phrasing things I lay is just because it's convenient for his narrative

1383
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,423
Further the situation that we're seeing in Ukraine has been going on a while

1384
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:41,823
I understand for 3rd 2021 The Washington Post reported on Russian troops to the Border Uke

1385
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:47,711
Like it's really complicated I don't dig into it too deeply today but

1386
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,503
The point I want to make is that it's very

1387
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,319
Clear that Alex is presenting a distorted version of event

1388
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,391
Nordby will sell his narrative that no matter what happens

1389
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Russian

1390
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,487
It seems like a strange position for someone who's this

1391
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,279
The staunch anti-communist but

1392
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,351
It does make sense because Satan on the Democratic party those the real

1393
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
Yeah

1394
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
And yeah so like

1395
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
I think he also is just piss

1396
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,263
The people are talking about the potential of a false flag

1397
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,687
It's really rude I read all about the government the United States government literally being like

1398
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,503
They're going to launch his false-flag and I had to I felt like Alec

1399
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
Places like you

1400
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Mayan

1401
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
The globalist always

1402
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
Convert a

1403
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Projector

1404
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
They have the history

1405
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
They have the motivate master

1406
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
The troops first

1407
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
So I would look for them

1408
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
To attack Russia

1409
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
Russian forces

1410
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
Defend themselves

1411
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,983
Order

1412
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
And it said the Russian.

1413
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
And now you have

1414
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Biden's

1415
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Election

1416
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Plan

1417
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Unified

1418
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
Find a proxy war

1419
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
With Russia

1420
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,647
Like a necessary midterm strategy

1421
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
Well I mean you don't want to lose

1422
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
Control of conquer

1423
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,791
So you should probably risk it all out total nuclear winter

1424
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,935
Has essentially convinced himself in his preaching

1425
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
That no matter what happens rushes The Vic

1426
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:20,383
If Russia attacks it was because the globalist secretly attacked them first

1427
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,271
Maybe the globalist ilapak Ukrainian forces to blame it on Russia but no matter what if hostilities break out

1428
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,599
Alex is already determined that the globalist will pull the false flag

1429
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Based on nothing

1430
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,207
Except his imaginary track record of the globalist bullying false flag

1431
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:39,327
Let's be clear Alex's track record of accusing the globalist of pulling false flag

1432
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,351
What is horrific

1433
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:45,727
He's constantly wrong about pretty much everything he calls a false flag and I'm only saying pretty much

1434
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,311
Because there's some situations where it's still unclear exactly what happen

1435
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,359
And I'm just not going make a determination on it

1436
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,639
Literally ever

1437
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
Everything that happens or Alex imagines

1438
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
Is going to happen is a globalist Volkswagen then

1439
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
Never actually is

1440
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
It's all in his head

1441
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
It's a way for him to preserve his worldview when reality

1442
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,207
Constantly proving him wrong

1443
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
Let's just

1444
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
That's that

1445
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,143
Blanket denial of reality wasn't the missing Malaysian plane a false flag

1446
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:19,007
That was something I say it was

1447
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
I do know that he said it was but I couldn't remember the exact specifics of it so I decided I wasn't going to bring it up again

1448
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,015
Yeah Everything is Everything is Everything

1449
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,111
Local things even

1450
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
I don't know

1451
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,183
The designation of a park

1452
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,743
The false flag

1453
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:46,143
That's the global is trying to take over public land coffee place was a false flag

1454
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:50,495
Oh yeah that was the communist

1455
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
But whatever

1456
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,383
That's about it. Russia butt

1457
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,943
He's got some insane lies

1458
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
About that last year's

1459
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:06,623
Storm that hit Texas

1460
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,927
And it hits really close

1461
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
Is that of Dallas-Fort Worth

1462
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Cbslocal

1463
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,887
And this is my frustration a year ago at this time

1464
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Almost a year ago

1465
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,007
6 days before a giant

1466
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,799
Blue northern

1467
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Polar vortex

1468
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
The

You're going to have

Freezing temp

1474
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
And you better get

1475
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Power output

1476
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
What up

1477
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
Power usage

1478
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Before the blizzard

1479
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Send message

Dubai the ministration

Early February

We need author

1484
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Possession

1485
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
Turn up

1486
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
Are gas plants

1487
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
Anarcho plants

1488
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Because the solar

1489
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Plants and

1490
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
Windmills

1491
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Will not delivering

1492
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Power

1493
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
The Federal

1494
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
Refused

1495
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
The emerge

1496
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Agency authorization

1497
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Under law

1498
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
You got to get authorization

1499
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
And pay millions of damn fine

1500
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
Or you go to prison

1501
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
You get indicted

1502
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:33,151
Completely made up story about what happened to cause the storm to be so bad in a power outage

1503
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Images of severe last year

1504
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,991
And it's painfully obvious has come up with

1505
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
His piece of fiction to explain thing

1506
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,903
The problem was largely based on the Texas power grid was separate from the National Grid

1507
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,975
Because they wanted to evade Federal Regulation and oversight

1508
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:51,327
Since our power is supplied and operated by deregulated private

1509
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,679
Maximize their profits and that meant cutting corners

1510
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,519
And things like weather protections for stuff like ice storms which are on

1511
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
Common insects

1512
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,639
There was a big dealer back in 2011 and it caused a bunch of blackout

1513
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,223
What's after which it was recommended that precautions be taken in case this happened again

1514
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,271
It's all on regulated

1515
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,343
There wasn't any mechanism to force anybody to take these precautions

1516
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
So they didn't

1517
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,999
When the 2021 winter storm hit their power sources were ill-equipped to operate in freezing conditions

1518
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,071
And this caused the wattage output to go down

1519
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,727
The problem is the fact that the state's power grid is disconnected from other states which are on the Federal

1520
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,799
Because of that it was really hard to redirect power from

1521
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,335
From other operating grades

1522
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
Into Texas is Grit

1523
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:41,503
This is a complete failure of Alex's political and institutional ideology

1524
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,087
The power grid was run exactly how he go to wanted it to be

1525
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,159
Consequences

1526
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,975
Blizzard that left hundreds dead

1527
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
Because billions and damage

1528
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,887
I was just a coward and he can't accept the things he Advocate cause this power failure

1529
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,775
So he has to make up a fun story where exactly the federal government sabotaging Texas but not allowing them to produce nearby

1530
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,079
True this is really sad

1531
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
Yeah

1532
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Here I was

1533
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
11/2

1534
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,551
Reading the actual state of Texas state

1535
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
About lettuce

1536
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,599
Turn up power on

1537
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Said said no

1538
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
They would even let text

1539
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
Just pay the fine

1540
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,327
Alex is reporting of this letter was

1541
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,263
He was saying that Scott sent a letter to the Department of energy and they denied their request to be able to produce more power

1542
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,127
Alex to report in a piece that he posted last February 20th

1543
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,479
But acting Department of energy secretary David huisenga had actually accepted

1544
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,271
And approved our tots request

1545
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,575
6 days prior on February 4th

1546
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879
I want you making s*** up back then

1547
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
Please continue to now because he's an a******

1548
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
I realized about the world in order to make it fit is it

1549
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
Extremist ideology

1550
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:02,399
Nothing more is going on here there's no way to admit that it's your fault

1551
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:06,495
Will be a fascist unregulated

1552
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,567
Pro f****** capitalism as fascist

1553
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
You can't look at that and be like oh

1554
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,687
Well maybe we should accept other points of view

1555
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
Sure

1556
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
We got like this

1557
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,527
Alex's b******* about last

1558
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,087
And now there's winter storms

1559
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,903
Who's that are threatening in Texas

1560
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
Forecast

1561
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,487
Answer this is hot on Alex's mind again

1562
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,583
A story that he's totally wrong about

1563
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,375
In the media

1564
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,703
A year ago wouldn't tell the truth will they tell the truth now

1565
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Eureka

1566
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,871
Kermit 25 Texas power plant

1567
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
Headline should be

1568
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,247
Power company told by said they can't operate during storm

1569
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,783
Not true

1570
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,111
Really false interpretation of the story about Texas pipeline

1571
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Give me the breakdown

1572
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
This was about a company called Energy Transfer LP having a financial dispute with the company that runs these

1573
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,095
Buy Power Plant

1574
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,375
Vista Corp

1575
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
They racked up a huge bill from the storm last year in that transfer was threatening to cut off the gas to the power plant

1576
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,151
Appealed to the Railroad Commission to step in and say that they can't do that

1577
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,455
Particularly during the winter since I will be Danger

1578
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
20th

1579
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,831
2 days before Alex's recording this special report

1580
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,647
Energy transfer had withdrawn their threat which

1581
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Should I kick the can down the road

1582
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,511
The financial dispute is still there but the gas is going to keep flowing

1583
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,375
Anyway this is nothing to do with the federal government telling people they can't make more energy that is

1584
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
Completely made up by Alex and has nothing

1585
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
Things to do with the story

1586
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,239
Seems more like Vista Corp

1587
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
Just doesn't want to pay the bill

1588
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:48,383
But also they were the position where bills were made

1589
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175
Considerably higher because of

1590
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,551
I don't know you like all the price gouging I mean that's kind of that you could

1591
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,855
Except that you f***** up

1592
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,439
Or you could just tell people you're not going to

1593
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
I always think

1594
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,767
I think that in this

1595
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
Instance

1596
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
I guess if you're like a real

1597
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,655
Market

1598
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,751
State person you'd be like well they have a bill and people are asked

1599
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,823
So they're the wrong

1600
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,663
You could also look at it be like what this company that supplying the gas is like this is

1601
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,943
Kind of lighting

1602
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,967
Extortion

1603
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
Absolutely cuz it's not

1604
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,855
Power plants that suffer it's the

1605
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,159
Customers that their power plants

1606
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
Everybody over

1607
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,999
Anyway the points

1608
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
To is that like

1609
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,815
I was just totally wrong about what the

1610
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,399
The story is about easing baking up a federal government line in it

1611
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
And then he's also

1612
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,239
Not telling his audience that it has been resolved

1613
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:51,359
Two days prior even relevant by the

1614
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,895
It was there's a headline

1615
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,991
You got a headline so f****** just cuz

1616
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,575
It doesn't mean anything anymore doesn't mean you don't have the headline

1617
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,159
The article

1618
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Dismal

1619
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,487
When you go read the article

1620
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
It's the truth

1621
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,047
And they say oh yeah

1622
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
They're not given emergency Opera

1623
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
PlayStation

1624
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Feds

1625
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Are ordering it

1626
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Turn off

1627
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
It goes on

1628
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,663
The pipeline company emergency transfer LP

1629
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,199
Run by Dallas billionaire

1630
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,503
Kelly Warren

1631
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,855
Women that needs to pay 21 million in penalties

1632

01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Dominion power outages

1636
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,023
You let Benny text

1637
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
The dark for days

1638
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,583
On the state was experiencing on

1639
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,607
Usually frigid temperature

1640
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
Then it goes on to say they're not going to pay him again

1641
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
So

1642
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
I'm explain again

1643
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
The feds

1644
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Don't

1645
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Let you

1646
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
Turn the power on

1647
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,359
21 million 25 million

1648
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,431
Find Power Magazine

1649
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
Operate

1650
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,759
That's what's going on

1651
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
That's WhatsApp

1652
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
Can we live in Idiocracy

1653
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,415
The 21 million figure that Alex is siding isn't government finds

1654
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:14,047
The amount of energy transfer was demanding that Luminate which is a subsidiary of Vista vistro

1655
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,351
Hey if they wanted to continue bumper

1656
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
It's nothing to be paid notifying from the federal government

1657
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:26,079
Even as Alex's reading as you can tell that he's struggling to make this fit his narrative science it's another

1658
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:31,199
Company that's run by an oil billionaire who's demanding payment not the government

1659
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,735
He's going through you can

1660
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,855
Hear his mind trying to insert words

1661
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Flag

1662
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,463
You just want to sit there be like Alex you realize that what else what you read

1663
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
The government was not mentioned

1664
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:50,655
And it explains the money it was all in there that you read

1665
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:54,751
Could you read out loud billionaire as though that was the good guy in the story

1666
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
And it's dead

1667
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,103
I don't understand how he expects

1668
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,431
It's that to not be like the most embarrassing read

1669
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
Imaginable

1670
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,855
This is a story that I was reporting based entirely on making s*** up because the reality of the situation is actually

1671
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,415
Scathing indictment of capitalism a deregulation

1672
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
He can't deal with that so instead

1673
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,791
Puppy story to report to the audience cuz it's more fun

1674
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
Hey let's be Escapist

1675
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
Hiding this

1676
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,191
Oh the Infowars tip of the spear we're fighting the big fight

1677
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:29,311
We're trying about headlines oil Baron says what am I supposed to be slightly less of a billionaire

1678
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
The winner of this story

1679
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,407
This is why it's really frustrating that Alex

1680
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
And this

1681
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,223
Report on like a really

1682
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
Condescending

1683
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Just remember

1684
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
Powers out

1685
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Blackout

1686
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
The government

1687
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
Has blocked us

1688
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,279
Carbon is evil when you're very body

1689
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Made out of carbon

1690
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,095
All right here's the final

1691
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
I appreciate you all watching

1692
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Ridiculous

1693
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
So

1694
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:01,311
Yeah he's he's decided that the government is blocked all carbon

1695
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Yes

1696
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
I need to explain something to the left

1697
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,711
All right and that is that if you are made of both

1698
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Carbon

1699
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
Nitrogen

1700
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,807
Hydrogen oxygen

1701
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,159
All of those things you can cram into your body in whatever

1702
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,207
Ratio that you desire

1703
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,999
Take a bunch of nitrogen

1704
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
Crannet right in your body

1705
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,119
Only the left would think that is a bad idea

1706
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
To cram nitrogen into your body

1707
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,703
Cuz they're dumb

1708
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
Totally

1709
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,567
Totally dumb

1710
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
A protects from

1711
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,735
So I think the Saturday report was coming

1712
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Disappoints

1713
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
The Ventura stairs

1714
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
I do think that Alex is trying to bail on

1715
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:52,767
Some of the covid stuff in order to move on to something else

1716
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,071
Like this cyber threats or

1717
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,119
Oh you know spending less

1718
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,399
Time of this

1719
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,215
Special Report on covid-19 on

1720
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:08,895
Ukraine and weather storms is a good sign right now he's spent way more time on timer

1721
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Goddamn

1722
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,247
What do you spend more time on it in the sense of life

1723
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
Declare Victory and all these governments are afraid of him isn't

1724
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,463
You know they come with a cyber-attack which I guess

1725
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Ukraine

1726
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:30,143
But I guess I were to act like isn't included in the things that they're afraid of from Alex and his Awakening Buddies

1727
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
You'd think that they would just not pull anything

1728
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,799
Right

1729
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,359
Little holes in the defensive Auntie back

1730
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
Text people's you know like

1731
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,711
Next thing is going to be too many horses

1732
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,807
And they're going to be like we got to have a lockdown from all these f****** horses everywhere

1733
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,623
Yeah this is all dump

1734
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:54,207
I am interested to see what happens when

1735
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
Alex is back

1736
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,303
Can Studios going to be back to his old bullshiter

1737
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Tubi

1738
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:05,471
I assume that will be happening within the next week

1739
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
I think that he needed

1740
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,335
I think you needed to feel good and so this is the way he

1741
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,151
You know he did it by lying about Boris Johnson

1742
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Some s*** and then

1743
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,831
He got it out of his system and then decided to scare people more at the end

1744
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,855
Little bit enviable

1745
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,647
Sometimes you need a win

1746
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:29,023
You know sometimes you just need one and sometimes you don't get one but imagine if you when you needed one

1747
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,327
You could just say you got one and that was

1748
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Exact

1749
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,911
That's amazing that's a superpower

1750
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,471
Yeah yeah we should all be so lucky

1751
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:43,103
Just declare win right now we've won we've defeated Infowars forever

1752
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,503
With this episode we one we've pushed them back we did it we put some back in town

1753
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:55,903
Well you obviously in the meantime

1754
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,743
Go to bed Jordan

1755
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,071
But until then I'm needle I'm Leo MDX blarcom

1756
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
And now here comes

1757
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,935
Holding

1758
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:13,824
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
