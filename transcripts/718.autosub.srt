Was kind of the same there were 40 people listening and we did it like this

27
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776

00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,183
Alex likes him and by definition Alex doesn't like

190
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Just don't they don't like it possibly be one

191
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
That simple

192
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
He's just a good old-fashioned National

193
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Alex

194
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
In reality is an ultra-nationalist imperialism

195
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,175
I don't want to quibble about whether or not his ideas would strictly be called fascistic like in an academic setting

196
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
It's fair enough to say that

197
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Watching the ball

198
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
I am you know what when you go with

199
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,623
Warmonger and fascist I really don't feel like there's that much of a difference

200
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Prince at the end of the day there are distinctions but I know what you mean

201
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
For those who have not heard the news on Sunday August 21st Dugan's daughter Dario was killed in

202
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
Car bomb attack while leaving an event

203
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Pretended that night called

204
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Tradition

205
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Any aftermath Russia

206
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Intelligences blame

207
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Enforces from

208
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
Ukraine while Ukraine has denied all involvement

209
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Others have suggested that he got tagged

210
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Was carried out by Fringe groups within Russia or possibly

211
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
Even the Russian intelligence Services themselves

212
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
The very much unknown at this point who did it

213
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
And it may be something that's never really nailed down concrete never know

214
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
Books like just back up and let's

215
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Spread out and let's

216
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Take a larger view here

217
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
I'll tell you who did it

218
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Someone who declared war

219
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
Somebody was up to no good that's what I would suggest is if you declare war

220
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
Declares war and then bombing start happening it's like your reward man like you earned it

221
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
That's how it goes

222
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
I feel like you don't get to be mad about it

223
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
I can see your perspective

224
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm I'm less interested it from what I was saying

225
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
Citrus did in that position more like

226
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
Who knows who did it to be a discussion that a lot of people are hazard

227
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
We people like our

228
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Like right you know it's a lie was it this side or that side whatever I you're saying

229
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,039
In Love and War kind go

230
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Sure

231
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Take this opportunity though here to call myself out for some of the coverage of Dugan back when he was on Alex's show

232
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
Circa 2017

233
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
I'll stand by my statement that it was a really big deal that I crossover was happening but I think I probably was too credulous.

234
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
The media stories that I was reading at the time

235
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
The painted Dugan as being much

236
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
More connected to Putin and the official government channels

237
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
That he may actually be

238
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,223
I'm not entirely sure how much of that is real that like he's he's

239
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Spell really how much of it is Bluster

240
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,439
Approaching the show the same way that I am now back then I probably would have presented it a little bit

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
I still would have presented their collaboration is troubling

242
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
Because whether or not Dugan is closely associated with

243
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
He's definitely associated with International far-right extremists

244
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
In 2018

245
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Lauren Southern posted an image of herself and Dugan meeting

246
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
And this was back when Lauren was making

247
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
Completely fraudulent documentaries meant to demonize immigrants

248
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,551
When was going on adventures to intercept migrant boats along with members of generation identity

249
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
Group with links to the guy who carried out the shooting at that mosque in Christchurch

250
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,767
And also going on tour with Stefan molyneux

251
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863
Meeting with do getting her now softer like

252
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,727
Glenn Beck in a sweater with Samantha BS Rebrand

253
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,335
Fellow anti-immigrant agitator Brittany Pettibone was along with Southern for her trip

254
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Tumi Dugan

255
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
Incidentally pettibone's go on to Mary generation identity leader Martin sellner whose home was raided after it was revealed

256
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Set the Christchurch shooter

257
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
It donated a disproportionately high amount to his group

258
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Great weird to that a guy from New Zealand to make a large donation to a random group in Austria without having any connection

259
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
There are other connections but even beyond that the influence of the ascending far-right Figures it's something that matter

260
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Given his beliefs at

261
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
As he wrote in his book foundations of geopolitics

262
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
It is essentially a port

263
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,479
To introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity encouraging all kinds of separatism and Ethel

264
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Social and racial conflict

265
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,391
Actively supporting all dissident movements extremist racist and sectarian groups

266
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
That's destabilizing internal political processes

267
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
In the United

268
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
This is a book that's been promoted by people like Jack the sobik

269
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
Richard Spencer probably not coincidentally figures or work

270
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
Looking to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity

271
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
And encouraging all kinds of stuff

272
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
Yeah it is weird how that worked out weird

273
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Anyway the point is that it

274
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,527
It's still super f***** up that Alex Fields this kinship with Dugan either they've been on each other show but I was

275
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
I think

276
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,135
In hindsight a little bit off base with how connected I believed him to be

277
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
Talked about it before

278
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
He's not

279
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,303
Come up necessarily and any large way but I've been meaning to address back

280
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
In some fashion

281
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,703
Well I mean it's regularly reported of him that he's being he's being his

282
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
Izzie Stevens philosophical architect of

283
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
The current

284
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,639
Russian imperial strategy yeah you could say that you know

285
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Oh he's

286
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,015
Well connected in the Inner Circle but that's not quite the same thing as being socially and

287
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,879
And so forth connected in in that way and it's tough to say

288
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
I've heard enough

289
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:02,559
Counter report of that and I've also heard from some listeners who are in Russia

290
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Or even

291
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Just in the surrounding area

292
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Who has

293
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Very different take

294
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Terms of what his

295
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
Position is Visa V food

296
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
It's not hard to think that

297
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
We can a trip

298
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Beat that to him

299
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
And it have it

300
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Have nothing to do with him actually

301
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
88 what is

302
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
The difference between some dude writing that and Putin just being like

303
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Hey you know it's a good idea

304
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
F****** up America

305
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
It's not that complicated of a strategy

306
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
It's just going in there and Wrecking ship

307
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
Write a note

308
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
It's it's me

309
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,423
It's the difference between like being on the same page and someone like having your ear

310
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
There is a difference

311
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,847
Stuart has fundamentally the effective it may be the same

312
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
But yeah so anyway Alex is mad

313
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
At the media coverage

314
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,063
Course of this story

315
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Maybe it was a false flag

316
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Idea that in the Moscow

317
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Suburbs

318
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
His daughter

319
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
Driving back in his car he was other vehicle

320
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Eeyore Putin would blow up

321
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
His own daughter

322
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
The London Telegraph

323
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,503
U.s. headlines it's a false flag

324
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,855
Supposedly lose $40 lawsuit

325
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
System parking cell

326
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Telegraph and others

327
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Moon la

328
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Just don't

329
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Talk about it anymore

330
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
I don't know

331
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
I can confirm that at least the telegraph suggested that the the attack was possibly a false flag

332
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Meant to incite the public

333
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Sporting further hostilities in Ukraine

334
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
I'm not sure if that was the widespread media Theory actually suggesting that the attack might have been carried

335
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Russian actors

336
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,439
Have specifically speculated that it could have been the work of a group

337
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Unaligned

338
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
Right right right somebody who's a dissident comprehend Russian let's take a crack at somebody that we think

339
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Number of

340
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:21,055
Suggestions the people have had and the argument that Alex is making where it's like a lot of people are coming out and saying

341
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,895
It was Dugan blowing up his own daughter

342
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,991
I don't know how I don't know how widespread belief that is

343
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Fundamentally of where is unfair

344
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
Doesn't get to say s*** right now

345
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
The unfair

346
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah

347
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Falls a little on deaf ears

348
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,327
Rimski I'm getting sued for suggesting that something could be a false flag of her questioning Ativan

349
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,167
If that were possible he would be getting sued everyday

350
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Heater frame people

351
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Which isn't the same thing

352
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:56,127
Also I'm not sure what defamation laws are like in Russia but based on the US Standard Dugan and his daughter or definite

353
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Nutley public figures

354
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
So talked about the possibility that the attack could have been a false flag wouldn't rise to the level of actual malice

355
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Required to be defamation

356
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Against them

357
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Just one of the reasons why Alex doesn't

358
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Get sued for all the shity talks about celebrity

359
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Public figure

360
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
So

361
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
About the defamation laws in Russia in 08

362
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Are there laws currently are on the more like

363
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
If we want to get you we got you

364
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Kind of side of the Majestic

365
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
This thing you know

366
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
It's defamation might be handled differently

367
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
Could be could be

368
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
So the Russians Alex has been monitoring

369
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
How the news reports are going there

370
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
They are not

371
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
The national Russian news

372
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
Mom

373
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Journalist to talk show host

374
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
His daughter was also

375
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Prominent

376
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
I guess in Russia they at

377
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
A1

378
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Feminine

379
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Sure

380
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Brianna is

381
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
While

382
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
That's okay

383
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
You can say is if you want maybe

384
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,567
Making this about himself

385
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,919
Don't you say that the number one big that I should have expected with that this

386
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Is about Alex

387
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
And somehow I was still like

388
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,367
Like so many of our listeners I was like I wonder what Alex is thoughts on this Earth

389
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
I knew what they were they were

390
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
Alex was right about everything

391
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Defective because

392
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Really

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
The actual bombing

394
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Right

395
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Seems like something Alex

396
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Could use to be like

397
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,335
Nationalists are under attack everywhere it's a sweet spot for it there

398
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
But instead it's about the media coverage

399
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
Because he can relate it to himself

400
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,319
It is sad and sad whenever he feels defensive it always

401
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Please comes back to him again Scott

402
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Material to work with on

403
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
And therapy now you definitely got that to work through

404
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
I think that you know that

405
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
The mental illness Works in a certain way instead of Behavioral

406
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Patterns

407
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Is an issues

408
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Once you become

409
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Serta behold into them and they

410
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Control you

411
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
Things become a little eye center

412
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,640
80s roller skating

413
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,968
Yeah speaking of that narcissism

414
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
He was clearly

415
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
A list of Russia he's the Alex

416
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Jones of Russia

417
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
I'm sorry what

418
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
Populist the popular talk show host

419
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Country

420
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
He's dead

421
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
The daughters dead

422
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
I want to make sure he died

423
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Have the motive

424
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
To kill him

425
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,688
No the Alex's describing himself once again the globalist what you killed me

426
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,808
Not only is he like Alexander Dugan

427
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Does the Target

428
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,696
But it is also that Alex is at Target through Alexander Dugan and in fact the globalist

429
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
We're trying to send Alex a message

430
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
That anyone can be God

431
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Believe

432
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
I mean why why would the globalist

433
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Alex's conception

434
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
Has the motive doesn't make sense

435
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
Like it's like obviously they don't want

436
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
Russia and Ukraine

437
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
So call me babe

438
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
No

439
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,040
Ukraine to join NATO

440
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
Even Russia out of crumbs

441
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
Assassinate

442
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
If you think it's

443
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
Progressed by

444
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800
Bombing someone who's seeing as an associate

445
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,640
It's too hot now maybe is a dry run

446
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
Maybe they're checking their that they're their OSHA

447
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
The leavening like a practice

448
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
I don't think that

449
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
Can we Car Bomb anybody like how do we car bomb

450
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
You know I take that

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
I know I'm going to throw this one out and I feel like a lot of people are going to laugh at me but

452
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Imma have to go with IRA

453
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
They have a

454
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Proven track record of this type of thing with steak Knife I'm just saying that

455
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
It's in their wheelhouse

456
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,408
And maybe they just got a little bit bored you know the troubles haven't been as hot lately according to Alex

457
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
That's all

458
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,064
Yasso

459
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,184
Now it all makes sense

460
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
Hyper simple they always fit

461
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
They do

462
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
So look this is not a false flag

463
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
And Alex explains why

464
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
And you could say maybe

465
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Climate Russia

466
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
Is it doing more in Ukraine

467
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
Putin into responding

468
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
Proxy wars for doing on

469
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Braeton

470
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
Isn't that actually an argument for why Putin

471
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
Could have done it

472
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
Because then you would have a pre-tax

473
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
To do the thing that the people want him to do

474
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Yeah

475
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
Ukrainian

476
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,664
Actors terrorist

477
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Right

478
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
That

479
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Alex's convoluted

480
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,344
Makes no sense I mean this is this is the problem because

481
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Just yesterday

482
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
By being on our last episode

483
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
We're talking about Alex saying

484
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
I pigheaded Lee did something

485
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
Precisely because other people told me not to

486
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
To do it and we're seeing example of him just being like

487
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
I'm not going to call it a false flag

488
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
Because they called it a false flag

489
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
Dickwad will end up calling it a false-flag would require him to say they like Putin

490
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
Was willing to do something or something like that

491
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Going to invade Ukraine

492
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,024
Right before Putin invaded Ukraine saying that Russian never does whole Flex

493
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
It's true so that you can go back on that

494
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah

495
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,984
That's your moment that's your moment to really pull it out and be like surprised this is the first

496
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Russian false flag

497
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
So what made it so

498
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Everybody should be able to ask question

499
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
But he's not

500
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
About this more

501
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
This is a false flag

502
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
Operation Northwood

503
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
CIA operatives and their families will get on a plane 8:59

504
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
I'll just change your name

505
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Text to go to war with

506
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Cuba and Russia

507
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Sure

508
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
Operation Northwoods ABC News

509
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
Did she change her name

510
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
You have a right

511
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
To say that

512
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Have a right to

513
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
About is silencing

514
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,936
The real disappointing again is evidence

515
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Is true

516
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
What is describing a true thing

517
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,848
You can question this exact thing

518
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
What is the evidence that we are

519
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Experiencing is that the telegraph

520
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:04,576
Did question this thing you are not being approved

521
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
But it is not for this reason that Alex is being sued by Alex is also banned being about ideas that maybe

522
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
No one cares

523
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
Interesting conspiracy

524
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,800
I will I look forward to Alex bringing that out

525
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,176
Around the midterms

526
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Dissipation

527
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,320
From her dad but you couldn't get it in Russia cuz he's too closely connected to Putin

528
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Now she's free

529
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,208
That could be so we have one last clip here from the 21st

530
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
From Sunday okay

531
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,840
Bobby Barnard roll solo

532
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,936
I don't believe Alex is just in for like

533
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
The first segment or two of the show

534
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
But he explains a little bit about his bankruptcy

535
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Talk about the lawsuit against

536
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
We've done

537
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
After 5

538
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Is reorganization

539
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Survival

540
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Continue on

541
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Pay its debt

542
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
In the last few hearings

543
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Coming out

544
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Have the

545
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Plaintiff lawyers

546
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Fluorosis lawyers

547
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
In the meetings

548
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
We wanted season shutdown we don't want the money

549
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
You supposed to keep it going

550
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
But they don't want money from judgement

551
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
We do they do that we're showing that right now

552
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Why is long as we

553
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,672
Opera

554
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,328
Bat for a year for the next five years here's what you can pay and that's what

555
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
And we stay on here

556
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,192
Hrdc my books I know haven't paid

557
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Open yarn app

558

Them shut down

566
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Don't you want money for the plaintiff

567
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
The families are nothing

568
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
They're using and controlling

569
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
I'm so rude

570
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
What this is all about

571
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Buy the products

572
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Infowarsstore.com

573
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
That might be a new defamation I mean how do you not play that Envy we need to shut them down

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
Down here in part of like hey

575
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
This is never going to stop

576
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
This is just never going to

577
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Listen to this this was yesterday

578
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Guess what I'm going to

579
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm going to call it now I would call my shot within the next week I will have another clip

580
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
For you by the end of the

581
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,544
So I don't know everything about bankruptcy law but from everything I can tell this is not a plan that's going to work

582
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
Businesses that have less than 7.5 million dollars in debt

583
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,016
He's trying to bankrupt Free Speech systems

584
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,344
They all like 50 million dollars to Alex's dad's shell company

585
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,696
And the Judgment in the Sandy Hook case the first one exceeded that amount already

586
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Additionally this debt limit only applies a 50

587
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
50% or more of the company's debt is business-related which doesn't include defamation judge

588
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,776
Also the only reason that the cap is 7.5 million as opposed to the original limit that this

589
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Subchapter had

590
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
At the original endo's 2.75 million

591
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
The only reason that's different is cuz of the cares Act

592
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Bright Alex

593
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Actually against

594
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
Chapter 5 is a subchapter of chapter 11

595
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Eeyore the reorganization

596
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
It seems pretty clear to me why Alex Jose this route and it's

597
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
Because chapter 5 bankruptcy cases specifically do not require a business to file a full disclosure statement to the court

598
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,936
Let's choose the one that let us hide our lives

599
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
The thing is that chapter 5

600
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
They were

601
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,128
It was created because chapter 11

602
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
Normal bankruptcies

603
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
Require all kinds of information

604
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
And two small businesses were what chapter

605
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
If I was made for you to handle the intricacies of a normal real

606
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Organization

607
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,864
Under chapter 11 of their debt is that they can't afford an incredibly expensive accountant

608
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,496
To help them actually do the stuff that they're supposed to do small businesses weren't able to take

609
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,592
Advantage of what they could get with a chapter 11 reorganization

610
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
And they just end up going out of business

611
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
So this was an attempt to provide an option

612
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
For them

613
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
To stay afloat

614
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,112
How much is basically attempted to abused the bankruptcy system and while he's doing it he's using the illusion of his persecution

615
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Who sells dumb products

616
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
To the audience

617
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,536
The news is that he probably doesn't qualify for chapter 5 and as this progresses to the court will see what happens

618
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,376
But I don't think that based on what I can find I don't think of tea

619
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
Is this going to work

620
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:12,032
Sometimes I really do think I understand that the court system does work slow

621
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:17,408
And needs to but God dammit for this case I really feel like everyday should go and you should play the judge

622
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Clip and be like

623
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
This options off the table that he said it

624
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Right done

625
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
Okay then tomorrow you bring in a cup like we should have this whole thing

626
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
Burned out in like a week

627
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,744
Well actually chapter 2 chapter 5 subsection or subchapter

628
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Is

629
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Design to be faster

630
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
So

631
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
There is that at least it'll go faster

632
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,008
How many chapters are there is a question I guarantee Alex's asked and then has

633
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
Can we just keep using them

634
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,872
Another chapter

635
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
So we get to the 22nd

636
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
With Monday's

637
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,016
Cuz I felt like we have not really even scratched the surface

638
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
So

639
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320

Here's a Masterwork

690
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Wild

691
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Absolutely

692
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Devastatingly

693
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Lays out how evil infected

694
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,648
What about recent Wars

695
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Alright

696
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
In the book

697
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
How does he spell Eva

698
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Ebel

699
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
I have two things I want to bring up about this

700
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
Okay the first thing yes is that

701
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,960
Manny's making pesos a lot of money

702
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,032
I hope he's happy about that hey the Amazon charts are very little

703
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
At least I was thinking about

704
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
United sign all these books

705
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
But it's

706
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
He does

707
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,600
You going to be drinking while he doesn't

708
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
Progressively floppy flowchart

709
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,632
Show up yeah the last book

710
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
How do I kind of want to know

711
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Did someone

712
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,848
Editing that's what I wanted look like

713
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,432
He didn't even write any didn't even write it

714
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,248
He said about dictator

715
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
Grab for Michelle Wright

716
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,928
Not even a surly dictated just people transcribe his rant

717
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
They think

718
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Cut out

719
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
The ramp

720
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304
Right there's no way that it's going to know that

721
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,912
I kind of want to read it just in case I'm going to read it and it doesn't come out until the 30th

722
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
And so

723
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,896
Kind of like how Alex's war was it the top of the charts and then no one cares

724
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
Whatever nobody care

725
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
Haha

726
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
Not even a book comes out

727
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
Definitely

728
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,976
I was thinking about doing a great reset

729
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,072
Special

730
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
Compared to Klaus Schwab book

731
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
The great reset

732
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Well

733
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Beck's books

734
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,032
The great reset

735
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
The three of them there's overlaps

736
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Sure who's making up what

737
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
Here's what I say we do

738
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
First off what we're going to do is we're going to

739
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
Cut-out little passages from each book

740
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
And then

741
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Glue them

742
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Together

743
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
And then take that message

744
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
And mail it to Alex

745
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
So it sounds like we're holding whatever

746
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Children

747
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
Holding the ecosystem

748
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Will come get

749
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
So

750
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
Look they're big news

751
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Musk

752
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
3 biggest whatever

753
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Most important

754
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,736
Elon Musk

755
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
The New World Order whether he's being legitimate or not

756
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
Christ says you judge a tree by its fruit

757
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Yesterday

758
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
Hundreds of thousands

759
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Elon Musk

760
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
Please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider

761
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,296
Normal

762
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
The world is that

763
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Racine

764
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
What is a demonic

765
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Technology

766
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
They're trying to find the

767
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
God particle

768
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Alright

769
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,240
Black holes

770
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Traffic

771
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
So this is not an important

772
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,320
We must shitposting

773
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,904
Also CERN isn't trying to create a black hole to blow the in

774
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,768
They found confirmation of existence of Higgs boson AKA

775
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
The God particle

776
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
Decade ago was a great day I was really excited I watch the live

777
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,104
Stream is really really cool Alex has not updated his starting point

778
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
You know what else cry said people similar to

779
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:27,904
You know it's easier for a rich guy to go through Heaven that it's awesome rich people are the best

780
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
I'm on in buddies I will make the head of a needle really promise to have tons of white baby

781
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,704
Open the Large Hadron Collider Ono

782
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Mandela effect

783
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
The Bible is a league

784
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
Saturday

785
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
Is that a movie I hope so

786
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Play it's not knowing

787
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
No.

788
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Dangerous

789
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
Blew up

790
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,416
A few years ago the last time they tried it now they're doing

791
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
Cast again

792
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Rituals

793
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Above-ground

794
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:17,312
So they had a helium leak in 2008

795
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,128
We could get to blow up

796
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,784
You don't even I can't begin to describe the Newsday

797
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Yeah

798
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,976
What does Rhydon

799
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
The Satanic rituals keep it

800
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,584
Staples

801
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
Great ritual comes great

802
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Particles

803
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Bro winners

804
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Hey listen

805
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
Quick-hit all headed to the left-field fence

806
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
So there's big news

807
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
Doctor Faustus

808
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
He has

809
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Decided to resign

810
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
Good for him

811
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Dr. fauci

812
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
Issued his resignation letter f

813
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
After 40 plus years

814
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Different federal agent

815
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
MCS murdering people

816
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
HIV rollout

817
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Discredited

818
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Monster

819
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
This Hitler

820
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
2.0

821
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
This Bill Gates

822
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
What

823
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Designs

824
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Was that one mean

825
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
Today that I have

826
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
National Institute of allergy

827
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Caesars

828
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
And chief of naive

829
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,495
Laboratory

830
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,103
As well as the position of chief medical advisor the President Joe Biden

831
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
I will be leaving this position

832
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
Getting some Arnold now

833
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
He now wants her B

834
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
Polio shots again

835
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
That impression was so inconsistent

836
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
How many do we go

837
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
I also like shifting mid Cent

838
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,639
He was trying to find his bearings and he didn't get there

839
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:35,039
Let's depressing from one of the greatest voice actors of our time who was offered the role of Optimus Prime

840
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
Every foot that he criticized Obama they said

841
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,695
They couldn't let him be Star-Lord if you criticize Obama

842
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,791
Also the CDC still recommends children get vaccinated against polio

843
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
Call April

844
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:53,983
The most likely due to low vaccination rates in some areas we recently saw at the identification of a case of polio

845
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
In Rockland County New York

846
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Experts believe

847
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
That if there's even one case

848
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
There is a very high likelihood that there are more people who have caught it in the area

849
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
But maybe asymptomatic which is 8

850
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Terrifying

851
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,647
Do us as a vaccination rate for polio of 93% whereas Rockland County is it about

852
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
60

853
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,535
Anyway this is not good and probably won't be the last we hear this story but

854
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Let's hope for the

855
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
How much is ready to handle the news of a possible Resurgence of polio those until just say that it's secretly covid vaccine side

856
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Back to being called Pollo

857
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,591
Lisa's audience selling them survival food as he watches them

858
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
Get sick and die

859
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
This is kind of what is busy

860
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
This model has largely evolved into after covid

861
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Yeah

862
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,295
Speculate on that

863
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,135
When you got paralysis

864
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
From the poison shots

865
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
And the record levels of heart attack

866
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Just he's already ready

867
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
I think

868
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
The number one thing I applaud couch

869
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
He4 is

870
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Retiring

871
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
With dignity

872
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Because

873
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,823
I'll be goddamned if I didn't quit that job

874
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,431
With the single largest f*** you to America anybody's ever like

875
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Nobody has earned the right to

876
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,343
Give the double bird on TV to the entire United States of America

877
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
More than 50

878
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Some

879
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
He might have a scathing book

880
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,559
Give up that's the name of fauci

881
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
She's booked give up on Hope

882
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Yeah

883
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,935
So are we get to the second hour of the program

884
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
And Alex isn't there for the first break

885
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
Like this place Special Report

886
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
What happens

887
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,823
Stop.

888
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,967
Second segment starts and I noticed that it seemed important switch

889
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,295
To an instrumental Jazz format

890
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
No

891
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
The Works of Antonio Carlos

892
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
The most dangerous facts eating

893
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
Create

894
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
Saved by the Bell

895
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,535
I was asking used as I've ever been in for a long time minutes

896
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:32,959
I don't know what was going on there there's some sort of a technical difficulty that goes out on the Range

897
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,311
Puppy started play elevator music on Infowars

898
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
So

899
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
I don't know what

900
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
What the f*** was happened

901
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
Steve Kerr shazzan

902
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
Alex's anti-vax upstack buddy

903
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
What know what just happened so I don't think I would ever notice

904
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,927
No but there are further difficulty

905
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
The facts

906
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,775
The shot doesn't lb does it protect you

907
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,927
Well it's just like I said on Fox News

908
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
And

909
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
You know Brian egg

910
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Who is the host

911
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Was caught off

912
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
Off guard

913
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
And

914
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
So he said well we can't verify those numbers

915
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
Actually telling people the truth

916
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Because Fox

917
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
Fox News has contractual commitments

918
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
That don't allow them

919
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
To speak

920
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Poorly about the vaccine

921
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
So they can't say anything

922
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,943
Anti-vax

923
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
On Fox News

924
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
But skipping that you heard is on Alakazam

925
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,575
Record

926
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Semantics

927
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Steve is playing

928
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,511
The Fox News host Brian Kilmeade was Steve statistics are completely

929
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,119
We do be isn't he can't prove that they're accurate and expresses that by saying we can't confirm that

930
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
He's naturally doesn't except that he

931
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
In fact scant

932
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
Confirm any of the bulshit

933
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,567
Using the wording of this comment greater Broderick

934
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Conspiracy

935
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,175
Of course you can't confirm this Brian Kilmeade here on the farm

936
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
Payroll right

937
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Right

938
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Scampi anti-vax I wonder what happened with Tucker

939
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
I am Hannity

940
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
And socks

941
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
And sometimes

942
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:31,743
See this is why we need to relax certain language

943
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
Requirements

944
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,303
44 like TV host

945
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
In this situation

946
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
You can't say we can't go

947
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Confirm that

948
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
How to say is

949
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Bulshit

950
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,495
Well let's not kill me

951
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,311
And I understand that but I feel like it should be required

952
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
Statistics Steve is talking about here because his sub-sect is full of posts claiming various bombshell things of

953
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,527
Vaccines and all them parently rely on

954
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Legitimate

955
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,879
I decided to consult one recent post with the headline quote

956
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
Do you know how many people have

957
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,743
Been killed worldwide by their governments from the covid shots

958
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,559
16000 around 12 million

959
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,399
What's 40 times the number of Americans who are killed in World War II

960
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
It's more than double the number killed by covid

961
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Let's aim to drinking

962
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,359
How was this number reach you're probably asking yourself first question

963
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,431
If I can even number first off here so Steve

964
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,807
Global death toll from the covid

965
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
But shot

966
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:33,183
In my opinion a reasonable estimate is to divide the number of doses by 1000

967
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
If you do that for 600 million doses delivered I know you did not get to 600,000

968
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,399
Call Paul no no no no

969
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
You just he just said it

970
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
That was his his

971
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:52,127
Basis for that number and extrapolate that up to the world

972
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:57,503
Expressing an opinion entirely nothing

973
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,807
This article is legitimately trash

974
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,135
Your Steve synthesizing his point which again is just

975
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
About him

976
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
Guessing based on nothing

977
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,791
Killing an awful lot of people but with world

978
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:16,191
What world leaders are looking the other way and saying nothing well all of us watch the high number of death reports in the media people who

979
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
Died quote

980
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,567
Play and hear no explanation for the medical community or the CDC

981
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,663
We're supposed to trust that they have things well in hand even though they won't

982
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Computer on camera in front of anyone

983
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,271
Who doesn't have scripted pre-approved questions

984
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:34,111
The vaccine was never mentioned in any of these unexplained death reports

985
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:39,743
Get people all over the world have noticed that these unexpected deaths are only happening to the vaccinated

986
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
I wonder why

987
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
And I would say what unexpected deaths are you talkin to

988
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,703
Any specifics offered in the article so I don't

989
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Know if I agree that there are

990
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,311
We are seeing a huge number of unexpected deaths

991
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
You know what bump

992
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
Cuz this is really

993
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Suspicious

994
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
One of these

995
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
Medical professionals

996
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
Can we even call them that is the first question

997
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
But not one of them will go on live

998
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
TV in a

999
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Pitt

1000
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Filled with

1001
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
Hungry Howie near

1002
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Why not

1003
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Why not

1004
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
What are they afraid of Dan

1005
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
You're right

1006
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,471
Time taken

1007
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,663
There are occasionally like celebrities who died with no immediate cause of death determined and then these anti-vax idiots

1008
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
Sandy was a vaccine death but typically

1009
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
In all of those cases a death

1010
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,855
That's cause is determined but it's after people like Steve stop caring about

1011
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,695
Is using for the immediate dopamine Rush of like

1012
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,327
Hey get this this person who you love was killed by fauci it's hard to wait a couple of days

1013
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
Is to say that though after the

1014
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
Already figured out the app

1015
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
Yeah yeah totally clear

1016
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
Steve curse of the Luna

1017
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,055
This article also includes this

1018
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Cook

1019
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:03,455
We are approaching the Six Million Jews killed in the Holocaust over. Of 12 Years

1020
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,831
People worldwide at least six times faster than the Germans did

1021
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,927
We're killing nearly close to 10,000 people everyday

1022
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,767
The latest rate was roughly 8.46 million doses a day

1023
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:22,911
Interesting Lee this is not self-limiting because 385000 babies are born everyday

1024
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,727
So the killing can go on indefinitely even if

1025
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,543
The birth rate drops by 90% due to the shots

1026
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
In case you were wondering I just thought

1027
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
High point that out

1028
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,175
This is complete drivel

1029
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Benefactor

1030
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,783
I feel like we need to really Hammer home but this

1031
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,855
This obsession with comparing things to the Holocaust

1032
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,695
Is Holocaust minimisation which is a subset of Holocaust denial

1033
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
There's a reason that they are so focused on

1034
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:58,239
To make it feel like the Holocaust wasn't that big a deal after all that wasn't compared to vaccination exactly

1035
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,799
Giotto fronting about Steve logic

1036
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:06,175
Secure 10,000 people aren't being killed by the vaccine everyday

1037
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Beyond that

1038
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,223
This supposed

1039
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,319
Could not go on indefinitely even if the birth rate drop 90%

1040
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:17,951
Because of societal problems that would accompany that drop in birth rates would read your ten thousand deaths a day

1041
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
A side issue

1042
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,327
Everything would be over I mean

1043
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,863
Just the devastation of

1044
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
Everything daily

1045
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Crazy

1046
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,703
Business statistics

1047
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
20th

1048
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Steve poster

1049
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
The blog entry were use begging people who work

1050
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
Hospitals to provide it with internal data

1051
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,223
How about their numbers of deaths NICU admissions based on vaccination status

1052
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:46,111
This is probably illegal for them to divulge but also whatever results he gets from this Ark

1053
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
Completely meaningless

1054
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:54,047
He's Gathering data through the equivalent of a Google survey form where anyone could just enter whatever numbers they want

1055
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
Pretend play work at a hospital

1056
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,631
Right right right but also

1057
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,471
He's at he's sending out a Google survey form that says

1058
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,519
Please commit a crime yes or no

1059
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
Pretend cry

1060
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
Is data collection form is apparently something he's been using for a while but he's just now updated Hospital level

1061
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,439
Before you can enter information about your family

1062
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,279
Confirm to your household and how many people were hurt or killed by

1063
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
Sure that's nice of

1064
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,447
It's probably a fair assumption that he's been treating the responses to this as actual data as opposed to him

1065
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
Targeting a

1066
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
A very

1067
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
Strongly self-selected anti-vax community

1068
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
Potential responders do a survey

1069
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
Women having literally 08

1070
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
Confirm any of the numbers people enter into the survey

1071
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
It's like

1072
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,295
Bear's butt in Arkham Asylum

1073
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,367
Yeah what it what would he be

1074
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Who did villain name be

1075
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
I don't know

1076
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,255
The sub stacking that's not good

1077
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
No.

1078
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
The Blogger now that's terrible

1079
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
Information about putting out means

1080
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
Exactly nothing

1081
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
It's the kind of thing that could be used

1082
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,055
To create an impression that it's something more legitimate and more scholarly than just

1083
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Apocryphal

1084
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
Goats that the anti-vax

1085
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Community has

1086
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,735
Do you think the usually reliable right

1087
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:21,087
And this is a way that he can sort of mold those numbers

1088
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,415
And it gives the appearance of it meaning something more than just

1089
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
Suck tweet

1090
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:32,351
Off the top of my head I would say that the way to treat these fairly would be to take the total number of ceviche

1091
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
Submission

1092
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,935
And / 1,000 and then that's

1093
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
That's the number that are accurate

1094
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Sure

1095
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,519
Now probably this guy sucks

1096
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:46,175
Really appreciated him over this pretty pretty

1097
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,759
Yeah they're calling for war

1098
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Steve sucks yeah

1099
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,879
Yeah he's trying to explain to Alex here that the media is bought off

1100
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
I meant something very true

1101
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Put something really tragic

1102
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
20 people that a whole bunch of media Outlets

1103
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
Got bought off of contracts

1104
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Pfizer 2 years ago

1105
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Yeah well

1106
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
We know that the White House is

1107
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Suspense

1108
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
A billion dollars

1109
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,335
On influencing media and giving

1110
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Money to Media

1111
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
To promote

1112
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
These vaccines

1113
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
And the drug companies

1114
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
We don't know what the contract

1115
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
It's pretty clear that there was no interest

1116
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
Hello

1117
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Have we lost

1118
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
We lost the show

1119
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,471
You got your wish

1120
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,287
The Giants

1121
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
You can't get rid of jazz

1122
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
I don't know what was going on on this episode but it was weird

1123
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Okay

1124
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:58,623
Listings like a great time for Alex to bring up the the time that Trump got that donation for visor right

1125
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
Like as we learned about that on our last

1126
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,231
Oh yeah yeah

1127
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:09,631
He's now it seems like Trump being involved with that that you would need that information.

1128
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,423
Not right now okay

1129
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,239
I do appreciate the lack of continuity

1130
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
This clip is just dumb

1131
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
And I'll see if

1132
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,335
You can figure out why

1133
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
I got this

1134
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
There's not enough jazz

1135
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
Snow this all this is really like

1136
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
Keep your ears open

1137
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
Leftist now

1138
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Are waking up

1139
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
And I just look

1140
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Facebook

1141
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Everywhere

1142
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,255
People are saying I'm paralyzed my mom's dad my kids paralyzed I dyed my husband died

1143
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,327
What was what why did Eiffel.

1144
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,423
I don't know he's looking on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere

1145
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Yeah

1146
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
I mean

1147
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Okay

1148
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Right

1149
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,783
I know he's just talk too fast but it's funny

1150
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,927
Is my mom sick

1151
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,791
Did Leicester City

1152
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
I read once

1153
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,471
Isn't that what a Christmas Carol was really all about if you're in the shadow realm are you shadowbanned

1154
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,591
No I think if you're in the shadow realm you actually get past this shadowban because you can move through it

1155
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
It's okay

1156
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:30,015
Ativan is like a door in the shadow realm like a regular human couldn't pass through the shadow door

1157
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,087
So you're saying that all the most popular Twitter accounts are ghosts

1158
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Absolutely

1159
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
What is

1160
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Is drill but it goes

1161
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,791
Steve at the story to tell my friends and this is dumb

1162
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,863
And we see people in plain sight

1163
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,191
I saw an Arab and bassador

1164
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,983
He's speaking at a podium

1165
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Drop dead

1166
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
But we seen that

1167
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,175
Over and over again

1168
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,343
Steve is telling a story it's very clear that the only thing he knows here is that he seen a video on social media

1169
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,207
He has no idea who this person was or the circumstances depicted in the video at all

1170
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,047
Big towels that he's calling him an air of Ambassador

1171
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:19,679
This was the narrative that took hold of the video traveled in anti-vax circles online but it's not correct

1172
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
It was actually a Saudi busy

1173
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,311
A man named Mohammed bin Nasser bin was on

1174
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
Al-qahtani

1175
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Who was in Egypt

1176
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
For confer

1177
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
He was giving a speech and he collapsed

1178
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,015
Allegedly going on to die in another room is he will attempt it.

1179
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
Provide a

1180
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
The cause of death here is not determined yet and there's no evidence that al-qahtani was or was not vaccinate

1181
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
All this is just

1182
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,583
Forced conjecture on Steve's Bar because it's more profitable for him to make this suspicious

1183
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
When it very well could have just been a heart attack

1184
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,751
There's no reason to automatically be like

1185
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,287
Why aren't they telling us

1186
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
What's going on here

1187
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,919
I can't get over the idea that we've seen this over and over

1188
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:05,247
I have not seen a ton of videos of people collapsing at podium

1189
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Recently

1190
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
Or infected my entire life

1191
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
How many can you remember to

1192
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,695
People collapsing podiums in the middle of

1193
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,791
I saw this one that Steve posted

1194
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:23,423
George Bush

1195
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
I think I saw a cartoon once

1196
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,615
Of somebody who is like in a debate club like a shave club off the points when he ran out of

1197
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,919
Aaron just collapsed Arnold

1198
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Think it might have been

1199
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
I don't know if something in that sort of part of my brain

1200
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,999
Has been on a Arnold real monsters

1201
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,095
It was Rocko's Modern Life

1202
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,375
Sifl and Olly

1203
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
No no

1204
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
No no

1205
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,287
I need to do what's up

1206
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
Just go back to some of that stuff

1207
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
And see if it's any good

1208
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Or maybe I should

1209
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
No

1210
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:13,087
You stopped smoking weed you shouldn't go back

1211
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,111
I thought I'd be a sister

1212
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
So

1213
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
Steve

1214
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,487
Has these strategies in order to create is Conte

1215
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,327
You have obviously this weird Google form

1216
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
But he wants me to fill out with

1217
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:30,751
Information they very well could be making up Google crime form

1218
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Is obviously there

1219
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,359
He misuses various data in order to make points

1220
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Man fixes

1221
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Nuts

1222
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,247
Obvious what is going on

1223
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
There is no way to explain

1224
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Nearest

1225
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
Vaccine adverse event reporting

1226
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,423
Yes what anybody can go to

1227
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
Open verus.

1228
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,263
And there's something called the Redbox

1229
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,871
If you go to that page and open bears.com go to the Redbox on Waze

1230
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,711
And you flip the slider in David

1231
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,271
Because it shows you by default that shows you

1232
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,623
Flip the switch to go us only

1233
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,671
Around 14,000

1234
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
Now

1235
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
The problem there is that the 40

1236
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Thousand

1237
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
Underreported death

1238
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
So

1239
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
People don't

1240
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
Report

1241
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:36,287
So it turns out that for every death reported to Ferris Bill really about

1242
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
20

1243
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
So I'm getting it today

1244
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,063
All right now

1245
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Escape that

1246
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
The deathblow here

1247
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,183
Look at the various numbers you'll see

1248
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,303
14000 * 41

1249
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
Sure

1250
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
Great

1251
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
See there's under-reported

1252
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
And

1253
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,191
This makes some sense

1254
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
For some side effects

1255
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Headache

1256
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,103
Right it's not everybody's going to report a head would you report a headache nausea defense

1257
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Picture

1258
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,407
Death is a little

1259
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:19,807
It's hard not to report it cuz there's other people who are doing the report self-report.

1260
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,695
Tweeted that was

1261
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,511
Yeah certainly better than musk's down by ship

1262
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:33,887
Yeah yeah this is Ludacris and there's no

1263
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,727
No defense of X 41

1264
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,567
The actual website that he's using the open fares yeah

1265
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
Says on the bottom

1266
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
These are not causal

1267
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
This is not causal data

1268
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Deckrite

1269
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,503
You cannot be my Thursday qualifier

1270
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
On the page

1271
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:56,159
Go fuc yourself. Cause oh but you should * 41

1272
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
What's 41 +

1273
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
Get a Google form

1274
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Yeah yeah yeah

1275
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
He's a fan of s*** and I can't pull the song title

1276
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
Sum 41

1277
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
Fat lip

1278
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,215
That's what it is

1279
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
Haha

1280
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:16,895
Hanging out drinking in the back of an El Camino

1281
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
1041 song

1282
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
In Too Deep

1283
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,831
Wow cuz I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep

1284
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,647
Is that really what they sounded like

1285
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,951
Weren't they supposed to be like Punk or something

1286
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
Papa

1287
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,023
Oh don't do things don't

1288
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,815
Exist together yeah everybody does

1289
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:41,215
Doesn't everybody know that those two things can't be back and they can't do it works for a while there was a guy named Steve

1290
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Evo in that band and I always thought there was weird

1291
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,079
Because he was around after jackass

1292
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
So you just

1293
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,151
Just took the name Steve-O

1294
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:55,551
Steve-O

1295
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
Wow there's two options

1296
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,879
You're grandfathered in on the name

1297
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
Yeah but you have to put sticks in their your drummer

1298
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Dammit

1299
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:08,607
Respect that's a different store

1300
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,703
He has a he is so stupid

1301
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
So Alex

1302
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
You don't have much

1303
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Tony fauci

1304
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
Is making every time my Madrona shot is delivered into someone's arm

1305
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,295
A lot

1306
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Problem

1307
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:33,695
So we have somebody who's directing this entire vaccination program

1308
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
Who has a huge conflict of interest

1309
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
That is

1310
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,911
Not something that should be allowed

1311
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,775
Exactly how much she's making

1312
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,311
On these vaccines

1313
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
We're not

1314
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,127
Allowed to know that

1315
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,735
How much is fauci making every time someone get to moderna shot problem

1316
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
I don't know

1317
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
You've negotiated

1318
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,415
Pacific 2 a.m. cut

1319
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,255
Strange

1320
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,303
Plus I thought

1321
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
Steve was like a stats and facts

1322
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
Dr. fauci is getting

1323
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:23,615
Apparently by himself like the CDC

1324
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:29,503
This is just rampant speculation and insinuation and if Steve was pressed on this question by a cop

1325
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Austin reporter

1326
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
He couldn't even say that about you made a single

1327
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
Anyone someone got him a during a shot

1328
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
This conspiracy is internally stupid

1329
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
Because here's where things breakdown

1330
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
So far she's pushing me shots

1331
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,583
To get rich which is willing to kill off

1332
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
12 million

1333
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,655
People in order to achieve apparently

1334
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
10000 a day right

1335
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,263
He's so money hungry just doesn't give a f***

1336
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,103
Why was the Pfizer vaccine the first one that was a brewery

1337
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
Wouldn't have stood to make

1338
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Way more money if

1339
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319
Madonna was the first one out of the gate that's too much scrutiny too many eyes do she ate with the second-tier

1340
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Get that red nose

1341
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,511
He thought you were really able to orchestrate this entire pandemic and the vaccine rollout and a big part of his motivation

1342
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Was money

1343
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,351
Why would a over 130 million less

1344
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
Doses of moderna been administered than Pfizer

1345
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:24,287
I'm sure the answer to this is attached to get the taste of both shots chair no doesn't really matter

1346
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
But this is

1347
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Wow you got to figure that it

1348
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,639
It's two shots for each

1349
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Maxine

1350
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,599
Of course yeah that's the way you get energy gets you in a higher cut on the booster margin

1351
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,903
Better

1352
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,255
Yeah I got you I would love for Steve to lay out whatever stock holding

1353
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
Things he believes fauci hazoor

1354
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Explain this nonsense but

1355
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
He's not going to do any of that cuz he's just talking s***

1356
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,447
It's easy to talk s*** when you just make

1357
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
Suggestions and insinuate guilt on people

1358
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
For fun

1359
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:01,151
Steve Harvey wondering why people won't talk to him or take him seriously

1360
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
A big part of why

1361
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
This ship

1362
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:08,319
Flies on your dumb sub stacker Infowars but if you try to go to the real world with it where words mean things

1363
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,855
Going to be a problem

1364
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,767
And that's even flick even Brian Kilmeade while you play this f****** stupid thing like no one else

1365
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:21,887
Loan wouldn't allow you to be like hey how much does fauci get purveyor

1366
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Yeah but I mean that's crazy

1367
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
2 crazy

1368
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,079
You should go to Infowars

1369
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,615
I might be by where you at

1370
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:36,991
Yeah I think he was on Bret Weinstein podcast

1371
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,087
Okay well we've all reached the Pinnacle of our careers I think

1372
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
So Alex almost Steve gone

1373
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,695
Another

1374
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,719
The f******

1375
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
Today

1376
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,023
Covid

1377
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,887
Denier guide

1378
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:58,239
No I think it's because Alex is trying to ramp up with the Trump

1379
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
Stop

1380
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
I think that that is like

1381
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,359
Covid is becoming front-and-center because

1382
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
The midterms are coming up

1383
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,967
And maybe he needs a way to

1384
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,623
At like have narrative flexibility or whatever

1385
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,415
That's

1386
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
Maybe what's going on right

1387
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,279
I'm not sure

1388
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,351
I'm kind of feeling like by ramping up the vaccine talk

1389
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
That gives Alex

1390
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
The wedge

1391
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,495
For the eventual or a nun eventual push

1392
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
Or

1393
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,311
Conversely

1394
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
It could be the

1395
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
The kind of contact you need to put out in order to get Trump to realize he should join the anti

1396
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
Kind of has multiple Apple

1397
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,575
Applications

1398
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:48,159
Kind of interesting to me that he doesn't understand narcissism

1399
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,463
Because ironically

1400
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
There's no way Trump would ever do that

1401
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
He feels

1402
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,815
Proud of the backs

1403
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
For doing

1404
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,143
So in order for him to

1405
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Change his mind on that

1406
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:02,239
He would have to take an accomplishment away from him

1407
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Samsel right

1408
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:08,383
It wouldn't be one of the few things that he could say like I'm more or less saved million

1409
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Games of luck

1410
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,503
That's a legitimate I mean obviously didn't

1411
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,807
Do by bat instead like

1412
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
A sentencing through his

1413
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
Incompetents Milly the people

1414
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Better than nothing

1415
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,487
I guess yeah

1416
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
Can't take away the vaccines existence yet

1417
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:32,959
It happened under $10 for

1418
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
Even if you weren't a narcissist

1419
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Why you wouldn't want

1420
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,103
What's 2 not proud of that

1421
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:45,503
Unequivocally pretty good all the way from a dog

1422
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
Actually sometimes it's not that hard

1423
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
I mean I'm talking about

1424
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,879
Imagine if

1425
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,927
Richard linklater is Alex had to be like

1426
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,743
I hated the movies that I was in

1427
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
That would never happen

1428
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:03,423
Or I hated my performance are outdated what happened

1429
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,495
You know he wouldn't be like I sucked in that movie

1430
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,055
Yeah probably not

1431
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,103
Yeah

1432
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
It's hard to say

1433
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,199
This is why you need to have a

1434
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,735
A mentality of like

1435
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Kill Your Darlings

1436
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,367
That kind of writerly mentality whatever these Idols are you

1437
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,951
Tear them down if you like something get rid of it right

1438
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:30,559
You can't you can't sit around and think about a great it was that you made that vaccine

1439
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
Burn the boats behind

1440
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:41,055
Break a copy of Waking Life

1441
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:44,127
Ammonia Lee it whatever you got to do

1442
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
Yeah but I think

1443
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
I think there is a way

1444
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
You know you're making a

1445
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,063
Interesting point of trying to find this sort of angle of like

1446
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,367
How you could appeal to a narcissist

1447
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,159
To get them to become antivirus

1448
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
Right

1449
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,487
And I guess it really comes down to like

1450
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
What you want

1451
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
What that person walk

1452
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
Right there out for money or power or something

1453
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
You could

1454
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,727
Make an argument that there's more money and power on this side

1455
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,567
True but that's still it does still run up against

1456
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
Like

1457
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,151
Disowning your own Tucci's mommy yeah that's

1458
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:23,551
Seems like the the rock and a hard place kind of situation here's my pants haha

1459
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
You admit you were wrong and

1460
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,463
Exactly

1461
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Alright

1462
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,279
You

1463
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
Get on the plane with him

1464
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:38,143
Alright hook him up to a machine that allows you to go inside

1465
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,239
Is dreams alright you play Asian Orion regret wife

1466
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Alright

1467
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,823
Then you go another level deep

1468
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,455
Inside of History are you following me here so I'm okay now here's the crazy part you have to have somebody build mazes

1469
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
For you why

1470
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Don't ask

1471
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
Questions

1472
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,319
Celebi ask you that what's that

1473
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
Can I bring a top

1474
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
Okay

1475
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Let's go

1476
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,023
So Steve leaves

1477
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Alex

1478
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
Talks another a T-Rex guy

1479
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
I was fighting

1480
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
Sleep Sheriff

1481
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,263
It's mostly about actuary I'd rather re watch Inception

1482
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,871
So after that Alex wants to talk a little business

1483
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Little bit coin

1484
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,735
I saw no donation that he got okay

1485
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
And I wish I knew now

1486
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,599
Why she was one of few years I knew was bad but

1487
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
I am

1488
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Lackadaisical

1489
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,071
Really that's what you think

1490
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
We hadn't gotten that

1491
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
Dollar donation

1492
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,943
Diamond hand because I didn't know we were

1493
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,991
Who are $3 behind

1494
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
We were

1495
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
6 million dollars

1496
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Told me right after

1497
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
We paid off the debt 6 million

1498
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
Coming in

1499
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Can you be on there

1500
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
It's all about God working in mysterious

1501
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
You don't know there's a God

1502
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,919
Who is this

1503
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
Unknown donor that literally

1504
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,319
New my finances better than me and gave us exact

1505
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,647
And we play the cards exactly right

1506
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,279
I wonder if Alex understands how much

1507
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
More suspicious that makes

1508
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
The donation to good God

1509
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,727
I know I know it's God or whatever but in the real world that sounds like a f****** shady deal

1510
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:54,591
Also based on intelligence doesn't qualify for bankruptcy

1511
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,199
If you were six million dollars in the whole Divine donation

1512
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:03,295
On what grounds is he declaring bankruptcy they're solvent now so he's

1513
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,343
Declaring bankruptcy wait hold on

1514
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
What

1515
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,903
That seems odd

1516
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
This is some real televangelist s*** right here this is like the most amazing to be fair this is something

1517
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:20,703
What does from time to time always make exactly what he needs is because it's God's will

1518
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,263
That's the s***

1519
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,335
The televangelists can do it like I have two private jets

1520
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
But they gave me just

1521
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
The exact amount of money that I piss

1522
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
This out on a daily basis

1523
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,503
That keeps us going

1524
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Spun

1525
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
Talk

1526
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087

1527
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Sure

1528
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,695
He doesn't hear the need it

1529
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
I'm sorry what he can

1530
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:47,839
He could start a podcast tomorrow he should have focused more on making money as what

1531
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,423
He just said no now he's going to say that he doesn't need money

1532
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,471
He does but not for him okay I got

1533
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,263
Gotcha

1534
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
A big show trial

1535
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103

1536
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151

Country

1538
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
Lying about us just attained a jury

1539
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,183
Try to win a lawsuit they're not going to shut anything down

1540
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,999
What cross street

1541
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,839

Yeah

1554
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,375
I don't know if it's a good sales pitch to be like

1555
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,423
What about Darren mcbreen

1556
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Spears

1557
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
No I mean won't somebody think of the Darren victory

1558
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:04,127
Stop what would happen to them if Infowars will go away

1559
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:10,527
I saw that I saw that some Outlet track down one of the jurors and talk to them about that

1560
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,319
Interesting piece would be

1561
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,135
Showing one of the jurors or if you could all live

1562
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
The jurors like these videos app

1563
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Afterwards

1564
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,743
And seeing how they would feel about their judge

1565
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,047
Meant that that would be a really interesting thing

1566
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
Yeah

1567
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:29,471
I wonder if they be like I did go much larger

1568
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,055
No not all of this also wonder how much is it

1569
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,615
You know the distinction between

1570
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
The actual damages

1571
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Sure I have the punitive damage

1572
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,783
I got I wonder if that would be swayed by him

1573
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Just being a total s*** head

1574
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,647
Yeah yeah I think I mean I imagine that they they came to the camp

1575
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
Transitory damages based on

1576
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Like math

1577
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Finish it and then

1578
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,279
If they knew that the punitive damages

1579
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,583
Quick come out to Alex's being like

1580
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,727
Punitive damages don't exist

1581
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,543
If the punishment is been equaled out by the guys eggs

1582
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
You with didn't mean any

1583
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,895
Anything that's not really punitive that is it

1584
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:14,015
Not really right but it's Eric apps in Texas than that I don't know what you can do

01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:11,424
Annual high and dry in arm wrestling feel that kind of alone guy

1651
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,008
In a deposition about it

1652
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
I would

1653
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:20,128
Say we don't need to give him for his money but now that I know that it's for kids

1654
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,176
And what do you think about Greg Reese

1655
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
I've never thought about Greg race

1656
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
It's not healthy

1657
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,528
It's a bad idea

1658
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:30,624
So we learned all that much about to Dugan's daughter

1659
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,744
I found I found myself to be underwhelmed by his coverage and

1660
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,048
Lot of it was just about himself and wife

1661
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,840
But why can't I do false

1662
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,424
Flagstaff

1663
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,264
Black stuff appreciate our episodes

1664
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
Set start with a topic

1665
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
And then end with you having

1666
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
To remind me what it was

1667
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,200
The topic was happens more than it should

1668
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
The lot

1669
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,600
It doesn't happen as often as people collapsing at podiums on live TV

1670
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,624
All the

1671
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Knots

1672
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
I like jazz

1673
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,304
I wonder if that'll be a new feature the show

1674
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
Yeah wonder if that's a sign of like

1675
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:15,168
Gcn just giving up

1676
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,984
The elevator music from now on

1677
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,568
I can start an elevator music podcast across the street tomorrow

1678
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
Ebony magazine

1679
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,944
And when

1680
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
