1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
June

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
We do indeed

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Please do

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Can you

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
Put it in the form of two questions

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Alright

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
If you are about to be in

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Where I

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Where you about to be indicted

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Let's bring it into the subjunctive

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
Would you appreciate it

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,376
If the leading propagandist of our times

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
At least the crazy

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,520
Propaganda t-shirts are the most effective

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Against All Odds

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
Alex Jones very effect

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,688
Would you like it if he was a huge fan of yours

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,576
No it probably will probably be bad probably be a bad look good

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
It sort of

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
Analyze who else is he a big fan of

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
And then it starts

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
To become like

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
That's really good analysis and that suggests

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,352
Answer to my next question

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,496
What is that who knows more about Alex

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Stressful open into a corner with a double?

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,504
Electric novelty beverages today

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
We're on the Elysian Fields

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,160
Space dust IPA

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
Or whatever the beer company is here I feel very bad now not knowing what the company this is

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
Stacy

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,496
Student email

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
I think you were f***** up yesterday

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,480
Hi yesterday the definition of sober

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Look I got to have both

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Otherwise one of the other doesn't work

38
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Well I'm not judging

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Today we're going to be going back

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
Into the past

41
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
We're going to begin a new investigation

42
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
That will be one of many investigations

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
Before the show

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
And the present

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Really sucks

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Yeah it's

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Easy to see through his games

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Quite frankly

49
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
We just had to November 4th

50
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Communist uprising

51
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
How did it go

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Went well they took most of the Eastern seaboard

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
Like a pillow this to

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,792
We all knew the the idea of like

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Alex

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Creating

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Possible scenario

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
I might want to talk

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
These games are being played over and over again and then at the same time

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
And there's all the

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,688
Sincerely nonsensical batshit stuff about helicopters at the Las Vegas shooting

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Sharai and what have you and that's just

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
I mean

64
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Not that fun

65
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
No we're still going to be talked about the present but I want to I want to take

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
I miss the 2015 investigate

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,304
Is what

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Maybe have sex with his mom maybe maybe

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Great guy and get on the train

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
Shrug on trains by friend

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
I'm so I'm going to I'm going to do we have a couple of time travel episodes

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Policy wonks

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Suggested

74
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,768
Spaceballs directionally a little bit more difficult than I would like to admit

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,632
Because they've just given date I've said I would like

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
It's too late

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
Showing vulnerability

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,336
With us

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,688
I'm working on the time travel episode

80
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
Specified date

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
But not years

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,648
So going through various Gears of a specific date and time to figure out did something happen this year

83
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a bit of work but I'm working on them and I will have something eventually

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
But for now I'm going to embark on exploration

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
But I want to figure out along the way

86
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,751
Today we're going to jump off on the investigation of

87
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
We now know why Alex Jones join

88
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,407
Trump that's what I heard but how long did it take him to go from

89
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
I love Rand Paul but I like the things the Trump is saying

90
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
All right we got is Fort Drum

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
To being I will die for truck

92
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
How long does that transformation take

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
And I suggest

94
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
It's not going to take long I think this is desiccation is going to be

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,703
I think it happens in January 2016

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
I think he becomes like a fully dedicated propaganda outlet for Trump

97
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
But today we're going to be going over January 6th and 7th

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Cuz in the new year he has David host

99
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
A better nurse that hangover affect that New Year's hangover

100
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Answer we jumping on

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
January 6th

102
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
New Year's is his favorite holiday cuz

103
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
If you get to dress like a Nazi

104
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
No Halloween for every holiday

105
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
You could dress like a Nazi anytime you want

106
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
Alex Alex Jones does spiritual come on now

107
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
We're going to get into this January 6th

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,015
Episode and we don't have a lot of new list

109
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,159
There's because that would sound very weird if you hadn't had a blatant

110
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
This bike has to go back through

111
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,839
Of the back-and-forth of Sandra Bullock's husband's activities

112
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
So he I'm going to play a clip of Barack Obama's

113
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,079
And oh my God I can't wait to hear him speaking speaking about a recent

114
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Shooting

115
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
In January of 26

116
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Left

117
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Still look pretty to think

118
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Clip

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,855
The Fey play on Infowars

120
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,975
Some spooky music but it's important to hear the phrasing

121
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
Sing in the words that Obama uses because Alex

122
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Complains about this clip

123
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
For almost the entire January 6th episode

124
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
So here is former President Barack Obama

125
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
We have a congressman

126
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Actions within my legal Authority

127
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
So that is

128
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Never heard it's a good thing

129
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
So I know to be afraid of it I absolutely

130
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,583
And the important thing to remember and I'm playing this up front because it's going

131
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Come up

132
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Pretty and inter

133
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Mentley

134
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
Pull out of the phrase into the uses is

135
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Until there's a congress that's in line with the majority of them

136
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Keep that in mind

137
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
And we will get back to

138
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
On this on this episode

139
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
He gets into the globalist to bit

140
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,671
Here is a globalist

141
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,047
A little bit about the other plans

142
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
Visa vie

143
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
If they're being successful or on their own

144
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Yeah

145
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,335
Bangladesh

146
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Destroy your own future

147
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,039
New Rochelle

148
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,671
In the pond as long as it's practice station

149
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
I hope you enjoy yourself I hope you're proud of

150
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Love yourself

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Now because Patriots

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
After 15 years

153
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
When did they admit that

154
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
The military

155
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
Actually sees how really evil it is behind the scenes

156
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
People in federal agency

157
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
Sure are some of the most people

158
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
So this this

159
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
Is the least intelligent

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Sentence I've ever heard my

161
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Spread our articles

162
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
That's kind of the subjects of it

163
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
But at the same time he's fulfilling a couple of his narratives one the military is the most awake they know everything

164
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
That's largely because he gets a lot of calls for military people

165
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
I meant beyond that

166
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
The globalists are 15 years behind playing

167
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
And they have admitted it

168
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
When did

169
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Now let me admit something

170
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
I'm 15 years behind on my life plant certainly

171
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
I'm 15 years behind on just general video games

172
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
12 hours yesterday I am exactly who I just got a switch

173
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
Seems like 12 hours is a soft

174
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
The very idea that they even in their their white papers are there

175
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Cockamamie

176
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
Teams like complete nonsense do they have conferences like the Hilton

177
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
But you know me this just

178
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Satisfies the other piece

179
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Piece of his narrative videos like

180
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,743
The reason that were not in FEMA camps right now is because of me

181
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
I am stopping the globalist

182
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Because of me

183
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
And people like me let's say Joseph

184
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
McCarthy back-in-the-day people who slow down the globalist plan

185
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
Welcome like you're welcome you're welcome

186
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
Huge fan of Woodrow Wilson he really took down the globe

187
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
All the time baby

188
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
I'm sure

189
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,255
I was watching the coverage of the supposed antifa riots

190
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
On Saturday

191
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
Who hosted the first

192
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
Like two hours of it and that's when I turned it off I was like I'll watch an hour and a half

193
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Evans bucket

194
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
And he needs to trim up his beard and that's

195
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Me talk

196
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
And a beard trim

197
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
And that's me saying why

198
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
He looks like s***

199
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
Griffin

200
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
It's just it was so boring it was terrible that Owen Shroyer on the street

201
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,423
It was just a man on the street interviews

202
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Right

203
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
The kids this time

204
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
Nothing it was just like it was background noise no one wants to talk to you

205
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
Basically no one did they do you like Trump want to talk to you in about

206
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
And then just walked away

207
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
Which I guess is the right thing to do.

208
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
But didn't want to just Dimension was

209
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
I got I got to watch the live

210
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,423
Chat a little bit oh no

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
A lot of blame the Jews

212
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Anal hole lot of people posting 1488

213
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Which I don't know if you know about

214
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Is that Nazis I feel like that's not

215
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Placemats

216
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,271
4088 is the SS route

217
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Heil Hitler

218
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Okay I'm on the 14 is the 14 words

219
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
We will protect The Preserve

220
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
I mean that's the subject

221
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,679
But what it is about preserving the future of our children

222
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:29,055
Right right and making sure nobody in different races f*** each other

223
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
Neo-Nazi

224
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
Then let me give you reasons why

225
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,319
But that's the thing that's the thing is like

226
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
We're Nazis but where is Humane

227
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
How could you play me Richard Spencer even talks about that like nonviolent ethnic cleansing

228
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,911
And stuff like that

229
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
Opposition has gone out the window

230
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
Let's not break that down to fart less you advocate for someone's murder

231
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
I agree

232
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,647
Under the laws of parody I'm sure this is at least somewhat legal

233
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Spell parody

234
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
The other parity

235
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Want to talk about though is

236
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
Whether or not Alex Jones is okay with it or cool with it

237
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Nazis flag

238
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
And he should know that there's a reason

239
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
You know what I'm saying

240
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Like that that

241
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,319
It's not really an accident like you don't know Morrissey has a large

242
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Hispanic

243
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Sand Bass

244
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
And people don't really know why

245
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
Like everyone's confused

246
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,791
Not not sure why this is the case.

247
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Weather

248
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,679
Speaks a lot about emotional issues that are shared by

249
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
First or second generation immigrants in LA

250
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Okay alright that's reasonable

251
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
I don't think that's so I don't think that explains everything

252
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Fine

253
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
That's a reasonable enough

254
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
And that's why we need to build a wall around

255
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Picture

256
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
The Holden is here

257
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:26,815
Enough explanation for a sort of bizarre counterintuitive fanbase

258
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,703
There is no explanation needed for why if you have a Nazi fanbase

259
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
You need to you

260
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,359
You might be playing tonight you are doing something right order to get that fan base

261
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And Alex should be aware that

262
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
Which is interesting Jeff Foxworthy made a career of

263
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Kind of making

264
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
King fun of Nazi

265
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
Is that is that true now that we know what redneck

266
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Really mean

267
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Oh boy

268
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,951
Exact

269
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
Civic

270
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Yeah it was next clip

271
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
You just might be hazard

272
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
In this next clip Alex

273
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
So we can

274
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
So in the next time we find that Alex at the beginning of 2016 has not lost his hard-on for Russia

275
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Over the new year he got drunk

276
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
And it came out of that hangover

277
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Still loves Russia

278
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
There's nowhere to run

279
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Digital

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
So now

281
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
He doesn't do a terrible job of diagnosing I'll probably

282
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
I think he's right he's not right

283
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,583
He's correct calm down he's not right but he have a pretty decent

284
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Point to make

285
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
About the idea of

286
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
You know centralized banking

287
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Having a detrimental effect on

288
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:16,127
Especially third world population disenfranchised

289
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
No cheese involved

290
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,039
I mean there's some juice involved

291
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
I don't I don't like you saying either put you hold off on

292
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
To talk about a blatantly anti-semitic subject

293
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Without

294
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,863
Having some like I just don't like it it's it's tough because we're dealing with someone who has

295
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
Such bailed and

296
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
Powerful under the surface answer

297
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
December 10th

298
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Using parody with him

299
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
It often

300
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Temp sound

301
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
And feels very uncomfortable

302
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,831
It's tough but I want you to hold your tongue about

303
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,671
I mean about any like he has a point

304
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
Because it falls off the rails pretty quick

305
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,863
And doesn't know

306
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
Or other organizations

307
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Rothschild

308
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Oligarch

309
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,935
First years ago

310
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Wasn't true and then turned out

311
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
This suit

312
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,271
Boris Yeltsin homeless people

313
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
A roll of

314
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
That's not

315
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
Until then

316
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
So there is

317
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
That narrative

318
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
Spelling here

319
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
I'm going to just come from a kernel of Truth

320
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,479
There were members of the Rothschilds family that sued I believe it was

321
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
The The Daily Mail

322
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Reliable

323
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Seems reasonable

324
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,207
Anybody who's in The Daily Mail probably has standing to sue the Daily Mail

325
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
Alright yeah I would

326
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,423
But in this case I wanted one of the reasons especially in terms of politics

327
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
Superhot is very difficult

328
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
2 proof

329
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
And what it what they posted

330
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
In the Daily Mail was that

331
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
This child

332
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Who is Diaz

333
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
It described in this independent

334
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Article here

335
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
XB Scion of the banking

336
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
King Dynasty in friend of seemingly everyone in the Spheres of Finance

337
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Business and politics

338
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
The Puppet Master to the baron of Hartlepool in Floyd

339
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
I'm having a great time

340
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Turtle poop

341
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
His name is Mister Mandell

342
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
And so the case

343
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
They did this libel case

344
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
Because it was found

345
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
Deeply involved with influencing mr. Mendelssohn

346
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
That's why you shouldn't people when they're right

347
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
Right it's a bad idea

348
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,975
It's one of those intimidation things that can go too far

349
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
Justice system

350
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
Peter till would have gotten his ass handed to him by God

351
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Yeah

352
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Unfortunately

353
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Over it

354
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
The daily mail's account of his and Mr mandelson

355
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,639
Trip to Russia in January of 2000

356
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,783
Mister mandelson whatever I can play

357
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,135
The Delight just to hear you say mister mandelson he is a Labour politician

358
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
And Britt

359
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,791
He has also recently said that he will work everyday Around the Clock

360
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
To undermine Jeremy corbyn

361
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
So we can tell that he's probably more

362
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,751
Yeah

363
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Labor people are the pro-corporate Democrats

364
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Corbin is your Bernie Sanders

365
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Except somehow he's

366
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Kind of Steel for brexit

367
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
It's a very strange thing I understand slightly where they

368
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
From 5

369
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
I think it's I think it's

370
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
I don't know

371
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,423
I don't understand the intricacies of British Politics as well as I'd like but I have heard a couple accounts of

372
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
Arguments for brexit

373
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:02,079
I think it's probably clunky and will be much

374
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
More negative

375
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
I just logistically

376
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
I don't think it's going to happen

377
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
No

378
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Thanks it's going to happen

379
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
If you thought it was actually going to happen

380
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,111
And they would have to start building borders between Northern Ireland

381
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,232
That will be a terrible blow to Alex's Patriot narrative

382
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Cuz it's one of the Cornerstone

383
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Knows that it's a terrible idea it was a terrible idea

384
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
I just wanted to get elected

385
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
It's just like it's just like Republicans Trump was a bad idea

386
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
It's amazing to me

387
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
What they will hide underneath will of the p

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,488
When they're lying to the people right right

389
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Like with the Republicans in like

390
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
Huge tax cuts to the corporate Rich are going to help you out and it's like it's the will of the people we can't go against

391
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,824
You could just tell them the truth

392
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
What's the difference between like if you want to take him to a medical perspective

393
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
16 lichen

394
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Unscented informed

395
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
You need to have when people are making

396
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
A medical decision they have to be aware of the risks

397
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
The literature and stuff like that and then once

398
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Once you have done that but you have informed

399
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Consent for vacation

400
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
To make a decision

401
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
There should be

402
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Some of that for voting

403
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:36,032
But I said anytime anybody tries to restrict voting we always

404
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
What even was

405
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
That was a tactical

406
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
Yeah the racist voting restrictions

407
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm sorry about the Rothschilds

408
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Standard Boogeyman

409
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
Alex Jones and

410
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
The Terrible

411
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Big

412
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Look up above the politician

413
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Pulling the strings

414
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
Is the Rockefellers aren't really around anymore

415
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Well David just died

416
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Yeah but yours back

417
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,664
Maybe you're so good

418
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Because it's been

419
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
So many years and generational has been split up among a bunch of people and none of them Wheels

420
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
The same power that like the baron of Rothschild did a hundred years ago children of Henry

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,608
Come anywhere near the power that he even like the wolf

422
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Keys and stuff like that

423
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
They have

424
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
Regionally or in small conclave

425
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
It's big influence

426
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,408
Like what they could have had during these

427
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,968
Like back in the days of Henry Ford

428
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
Not even close to that

429
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
Like the kroenke's live in Columbia Missouri

430
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Fortune

431
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Credo

432
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
In terms of paying athletes

433
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
Some stuff like that illegally car and I like

434
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,424
Weird under-the-table recruitment stuff that everybody's aware of

435
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
Argument is

436
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
App for another time but

437
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
It should be legal athletes should be paid

438
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Of course

439
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
They can do that

440
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
But no no

441
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
Did they can effects like Columbia local politics

442
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Stuff like that to a certain

443
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Extent that they

444
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
Dan seems like they can't send us to war

445
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Like you could have

446
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,888
So I'm going to read this this next paragraph and at the end of it it gets dicey

447
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
For the present

448
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,312
Mr Rothschild claims he was subjected to sustained and unjustified attacks

449
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
In the May 2010 article which portrayed him as a puppet

450
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
Dangling his friend Lord mandelson in front of the Russian oligarch

451
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,320
Oleg deripaska it to ease the passage of

452
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Colossal biz

453
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Do you recognize that name

454
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Oleg deripaska

455
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
It sounds Swedish

456
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,448
So I'm going to assume he's Swedish no it's not to mention positive could have been Middle East

457
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Is Isis Russian

458
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
He's Russian

459
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
Do you know what Russia has done Risa

460
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
Do you know what recently indicted gentleman was very involved with Oleg deripaska

461
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
I am still going

462
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,904
Is it a Swedish politician

463
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,024
No he's British there are no swedes in this story

464
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
Oleg deripaska is the Russian oligarch

465
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
That

466
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
Paul manafort offered to give briefing

467
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Things to

468
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
Indication

469
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
That's all there is

470
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
A lot of financial debt

471
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Between the two men

472
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Corsage

473
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,968
Bringing up this libel case about the Rothschild

474
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
Is a very interesting window

475
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Because

476
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,880
The only Russian oligarch involved is a person who's involved

477
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,232
Trump's campaign manager

478
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
The Rothschild Nathaniel Rothschild

479
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Brought Lord mandelson

480
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Along

481
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
To Russia

482
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Pretend

483
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,496
But if we can get some business deals going

484
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
Mandelson will be on your side in British politics

485
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Which is

486
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
You're like making a pattern

487
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
It's a good thing for him he doesn't read it because

488
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Totally

489
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
I mean if you just replace mandelson with manafort you have almost a parallel exact same situation

490
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Playbook

491
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:55,616
Russian oligarchs and billionaires

492
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
A playbook

493
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,760
It's almost like somebody we know Rhoda Playbook it's almost like somebody who's been on Alex

494
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Fashion show

495
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,880
Wrote The Playbook that is taught in Military Academy

496
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
It's weird

497
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
Back in 1910 with the Pez dispenser to try and make that kind of a claim with

498
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
About Alexander

499
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,104
I would get sued for libel by The Daily Mail

500
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
It's overestimate this because he is like super involved in a lot of f***** up stuff

501
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
In the stuff that we're talking about it makes him sound like

502
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
A big bad

503
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,328
So he's not the not the final boss no but he is a a cancerous influence

504
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,888
Couched in intellectualism

505
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
And what have you

506
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
ITunes

507
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
Worth talking about but

508
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
To pretend like

509
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
It all goes back to Dugan

510
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Placing some people on Twitter

511
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Sort of making those sorts of

512
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
It's just because he has he has such a

513
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,624
Long-standing history of anti liberalism

514
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
Anti-americanism

515
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Letgo

516
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
I like all that.

517
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Need to focus on

518
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
I don't know

519
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,704
Anyway Alex bringing up the Rothschild stuff there does not work in your favor

520
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
That's interesting interesting

521
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,616
It's fascinating to see him

522
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Talk about

523
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Global org

524
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
Realization as being something that he hate

525
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Wait so desperate

526
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Yeah I have no idea how

527
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Global organization

528
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Complicated system

529
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,744
We're in even the bad guys are good sometimes and the good guys are bad

530
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Because it's

531
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
Interlochen

532
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,424
Where everybody trying to play this longer game and you do this whole thing

533
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,496
And so he has no concept of complicated systems

534
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
He only understand

535
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Like he doesn't get it

536
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
And it is a failing in terms of him being able to be in news

537
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
About about the

538
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Variety

539
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
But I was watching

540
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
The quote-unquote

541
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Antifa riot

542
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
So

543
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Owen Shroyer was out on the

544
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
At the Austin

545
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Gathering of the

546
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
Resist fascism or whatever

547
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
Right and

548
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
Most of it was covering

549
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
How there were

550
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
More Trump

551
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Fans there

552
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,016
The protesters really kind of didn't know it was going to happen and the Trump people

553
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:47,136
We're like

554
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
But the other thing is

555
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
The lottery was Joe big

556
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Dancing around with pre-made sign

557
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
I would have you

558
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Like

559
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
They're covering

560
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
An Infowars reporter

561
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
F****** with

562
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Quote-unquote antifa

563
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,408
Optic side of the story

564
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
If you want to be a journalist

565
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,296
If you want to be doing journalism

566
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Well there's that

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
But also if you are Infowars anyway

568
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Yeah

569
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
Don't become as the story

570
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,864
You're sending in that Rambo Biggs on Twitter

571
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Report

572
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Him

573
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,776
Resisting the antifa it's so stupid

574
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,384
I know your point and I agree with that

575
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
But like from

576
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,248
Totally agree but real world

577
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,320
Get smart from

578
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Sandpoint

579
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
But if everyone understood to have journalism

580
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
Should work unbiased

581
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
External that's

582
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,352
It'll be like this is embarrassing you know he's still kind of works for you

583
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
Well but the the situation that we don't really know what the deal is

584
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
So

585
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,432
Right

586
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,528
I wish some jobs would like give me that kind of leeway

587
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
It's a good thing nobody got shot anyways you're going to take a day off right we're going to give you one day almost

588
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Somebody leave

589
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
I'm in your back

590
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,632
We all exactly of course of course they don't

591
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Want to do real journalist

592
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
Cuz that would be still

593
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
And hard so hard to do

594
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
To call you have to check sources information down the road

595
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,040
You can't have a 26 27 year old dude with probably like a sports

596
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Fitness degrees

597
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
I like

598
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,024
He'll make it a whole thing or hotel and restaurant management

599
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Like its

600
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
Maybe I'll tell you that right

601
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,848
History degree that I'm having like a media studies or something like that degree

602
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
It really is much better than Alec

603
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,736
Manipulating

604
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Like

605
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,088
You could see it in the way he's pivoted he did that

606
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
I'm pivoting away from Trump thing

607
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Pushing back against

608
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Trump

609
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Like you

610
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,352
Like that

611
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
I don't I don't believe

612
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
But that's still a much more cogent

613
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Argument

614
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
For your behavior than anything else

615
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,848
Yeah it's a little more savvy

616
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
And probably will last longer

617
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
That's

618
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
That's true

619
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,528
Almost nobody brings up any was involved in gamergate

620
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,392
Stuff and almost nobody brings up all the f***** up stuffy

621
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,792
We don't know the reason that it is a good idea for your dumbass

622
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
Is like Joe Biggs to Kobe and inserts

623
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Themselves into

624
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Story

625
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Is because if you're Alex

626
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Jones

627
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Your

628
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Higher

629
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
F****** business is built on

630
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
A personality

631
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,408
Inserting himself into the story more or less go

632
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Crazy story

633
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,464
That's interesting

634
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Personality

635
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
They are about the guy

636
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
You're onto something there

637
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Possible

638
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,984
I'm so I apologize that it's been almost half an hour since I played that clip of Obama

639
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
Into the in bringing this up

640
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
Here is a Alex

641
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
Bringing up this cliff

642
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
And like I said

643
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,856
I wanted to make a point of pointing out that what Obama actually said

644
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
Was we can't wait

645
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
For Congress to get in line with

646
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
The majority of them are

647
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,816
There are things that I can do within my legal Authority

648
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
To try and put a stat

649
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Against the tide of gun deaths

650
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Unnecessary.

651
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
The year is Alex Jones

652
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Covering that

653
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Largely innocuous

654
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,832
The President says Donald Trump disqualified

655
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Even

656
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
This was also in the context of comments being

657
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,744
Disqualifying and that sort of thing it wasn't like

658
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,608
Disqualified

659
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
He wasn't allowed to run it

660
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,496
I don't think I know I know Trump is a huge marathoner right past the physical

661
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Is there a physical

662
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,896
Trump's wife

663
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,832
What's it called

664
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,488
When you quote literally said quote quote

665
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Joseph Stalin

666
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Lenin

667
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
Frank Darabont

668
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Dusty Baker

669
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,616
Dusty Rhodes Rhodes Scholars

670
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
Better

671
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,248
About what

672
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
So at this point he's getting a little bit too much into his Yosemite Sam voice

673
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Service here just listen to this

674
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
React

675
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,344
I like your face didn't even boot like you took your eyebrows

676
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
We're at this point without like

677
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,792
Incredibly offensive I was starting to think about my white guilt

678
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,912
I do think it's okay if you're black

679
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
Parody

680
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,784
Sufferin Succotash

681
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
You good to him but he just

682
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,416
Like I'm going to go for it

683
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
Those are the same people who insisted

684
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
Because I don't like his economic

685
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Right

686
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
No he's allowed to do everything he wants cuz he's black you guys

687
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Now

688
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,808
Isis going to keep foreign treaties secret is that the method

689
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
Military treaty with Syria

690
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
And Russia

691
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,000
With no one else knowing

692
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
Let's go Patriots

693
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
Totally

694
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
I'll do the next play Alex

695
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,728
Is Kettle action pot calling the kettle black

696
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Here we go with this

697
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
This is

698
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Emily. Obama

699
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Up there

700
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
English

701
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
How much more will we put up with

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,048
Together

703
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
A satirical piece

704
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
14b or should I get a full view of it

705
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,592
Have you

706
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:14,272
So Alex you have brass balls

707
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Brass f****** balls

708
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,856
2

709
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Look

710
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,208
If anybody knows what fake crying looks like it's definitely Alex

711
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
Right and I think that that is why he makes claims like that it's like

712
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
I think deep down he's like

713
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Humans don't have emoji

714
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,848
I know that if your feet if you're looking like you feel something you're Faking It by do what is Obama trying to sell

715
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:45,248
Does he have a mineral line what is going on

716
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,320
Dude if Obama told brainforce

717
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,136
I might be far more likely to

718
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,376
First of two comedy pieces on this episode

719
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
Play Obama's press conference Ruiz

720
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Hardly speaking about

721
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Beach shootings

722
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,616
Open house we need to do a better job

723
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
On Sunday there was just another one

724
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
I actually just reinforces that

725
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
I like I like how

726
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,928
He's saying this like it's a drumbeat how much are we going to put up with hands like yeah no

727
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
You nailed it

728
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,536
That is exactly what he saying that's exactly what he's doing

729
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,840
And that's a question that we are

730
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Absolutely

731
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Incapable of asking

732
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,216
I think most of the country who are not the Holden

733
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
To the NRA

734
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
And what have you

735
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Alex is dumb

736
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Question we ask ourselves a lot

737
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Like how much

738
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
I mean you didn't show that there was a shooting like a couple blocks away from our houses together day

739
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,880
Yeah I had no idea yep that's that's how it turned out in like soda like

740
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
I mean what are you going to local big news

741
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
That's f***** up no

742
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
F*****-up Chicago

743
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Yeah

744
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,680
Which is the I-10 again we can talk about statistics all all day it's like

745
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,824
Chicago has a lower shooting death rate than any other routes

746
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,712
But at the same time we do live in a place where the second highest population third highest population in the country

747
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Nonsense

748
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Anyway

749
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
Alex thinks that Obama is faking cry

750
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Right now let's enjoy this next clip which

751
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
The sort of the

752
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Chaser to that shot

753
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:34,048
During the break I am in just a state of grief

754
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Morning but also explosive will resist at 5%

755
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Please give me the

756
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Rita Marley

757
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,072
Google back to that metaphor I also notice says amen

758
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
He prays a lot on air but never says amen

759
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Weird

760
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Is it the thing

761
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
I mean you're supposed to say Amen right I mean that's Attica

762
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
God needs an over and out

763
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Jesus Christ what a stupid

764
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Religion

765
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
NASCARs

766
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,376
Get angry

767
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
Not great

768
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
You don't have to give me more

769
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
I love America

770
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
And I'm angry because I'm so sad

771
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Right

772
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
It's if you watch the video it is so

773
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,167
I have tears in my eyes I don't want to know I don't want to have tears in my eyes

774
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
Is the most revealing Statin

775
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,543
Nobody who's ever cried against their will has been like

776
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
I'm doing this

777
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Even though I don't want to

778
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
To do the I feel this so powerful

779
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,319
I can't I don't even want to do that do you know what to it it's just fascinating to me the idea that he is

780
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Fake crying

781
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
It is very fake

782
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,207
Banana in the middle of saying that Obama's

783
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Tears are fake

784
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,559
David Obama really with crying

785
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
From everything I can tell it's

786
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Seems like he was sincere and genuine

787
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
Right I don't know I don't know the man personally

788
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
I haven't spent as much time studying him as I have

789
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Alex true

790
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,383
I'm willing to believe his tears were real I'm not willing

791
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,711
And based on that dichotomy the fact that he's like

792
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Alright

793
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
I'm trying to say the present

794
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Fake crying

795
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Right I really need a

796
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,415
A good cry

797
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,999
This month

798
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
I am going to

799
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,911
I will show you how it's done

800
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Goddamn emmerich

801
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:25,567
F****** Jones and Sandra Bullock as a Nazi

802
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
88rising

803
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Like

804
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
It it's so in line with what I have

805
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
Determine the terms of Alex's psychology

806
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,623
Talking about Obama fake crying but

807
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Alex

808
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
Absolute

809
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
About

810
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
Made a massive discovery

811
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
WhatsApp

812
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
Now it's a discovery that we kind of already know

813
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,799
Well it's it's it's something that we had the sense of

814
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,847
Before we didn't have as many

815
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Concrete

816
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
Examples

817
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
Alex Jones

818
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Chucky

819
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
The Alex Jones

820
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Is flattery

821
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,391
You can compromise him and corrupt him through flattery

822
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Incredibly

823
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
The same way we suspect the Trump

824
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,375
Possibly through his business might be more on the up-and-up in terms of business

825
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
But if anybody tells him

826
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
You're awesome

827
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
We love you

828
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
He falls in line

829
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,847
As we heard you talked to high-end Russian

830
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,663
Putin love the show

831
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,967
And Putin listens all the time and what have you

832
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
You can get

833
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
High-end mail-order bride

834
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
So I assume

835
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
No these are high in military Rush

836
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Did he married

837
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
You need to know

838
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
Is at the beginning of 26

839
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Alex Jones

840
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Scored an interview with Louis Farrakhan

841
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
That

842
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Is now my favorite thing

843
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
That you've ever said

844
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,591
Now we won't get to the entire interview on this episode

845
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
No because

846
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
You haven't heard it yet

847
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,503
The timeline that we're in

848
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,879
Jesus a good week and a half do you need it for the Conte

849
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,975
He is screaming about Louis Farrakhan and Hate

850
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,583
And hates the Nation of Islam and thinks they're a bunch of race-baiters

851
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
All that

852
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Naturally

853
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
He gets to go talk to Louis Farrakhan

854
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Now listen to this

855
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,543
The show transgender

856
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
All the race car

857
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Doesn't sound like it

858
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,735
And that's really what's so important about a possibility we have

859
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Disagree

860
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,439
You love him but matter

861
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,255
Famous 2-0 everyday and every week

862
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
Farrakhan

863
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Every week

864
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
What is Milo

865
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,663
Divide and conquer

866
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,015
Buy concrete

867
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
It's the Final Chapter folks you know what comes next

868
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
The dreaded false flag

869
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
Is a

870
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
Shooting

871
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Cameras

872
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Have your phone ready

873
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,759
And uploading

874
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,319
Agree

875
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,903
Asphalt

876
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
2

877
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,303
Immediately

878
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Eric went on longer than I am

879
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
Tattoo

880
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Is soft

881
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Herscher

882
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,799
False flag

883
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
Like you pointed out

884
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Obama's

885
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,551
His approval rating was over 50% right now Trump has it sitting right around 30 minutes

886
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
3637

887
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,647
And no one

888
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
No one

889
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
On the left

890
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Is asserting

891
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
Latest church shooting in Texas

892
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
Was a false flag

893
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,351
The trumpet organized or anything like that

894
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,679
I'd I know that that's a little bit ugly to even

895
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
Put into words

896
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
But the reason I want to do that

897
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
2 mirror

898
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,103
What other version of Alex

899
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Would be like right

900
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
And trying to look at like

901
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
What

902
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
How a

903
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
How gross

904
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Anybody else

905
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,343
Then Alex doing the things

906
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
He does ra

907
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
It's unthinkable

908
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,975
Well is unspeakable that anybody else would do this

909
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,303
But the polar opposite to falsehood isn't a

910
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
Current type of fault

911
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
That's true

912
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,471
Like we're we're people who tell at least as

913
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
As far as we are

914
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Research

915
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
Reality

916
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,711
Like a the Lusitania probably was

917
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Was sunk

918
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
As a false flag

919
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Absolutely

920
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,927
Play all of these things but it is definitely something that exists

921
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
The f*****-up CIA

922
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,839
Talk about how people having a lot of guns

923
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Is a bad idea

924
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,495
It's fine if you have died like I'm very

925
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
.

926
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
But

927
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
I get it

928
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
If you hunt if you have a gun to protect your family I get it

929
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
Even for fun

930
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Intuit

931
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,831
That she just likes to take out to go to the shooting range

932
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
And feel like she has a dick for an hour

933
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,463
Wichita misogynistic

934
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,583
Well I think that's what most people have guys feel like they have a bigger

935
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,703
Yeah I mean I don't know if that I don't know if that's necessarily the case

936
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,775
And recreational purposes having a gun is

937
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,079
Is totally cool but at the same time

938
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,127
It is a situation where you should do

939
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
There should be records

940
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
Nobody had a gun

941
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
But that's not going to

942
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
At this point I would prefer if nobody used a gun to murder large groups of people at one point would it be if

943
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:38,047
Everybody will hunted with went back to bow and arrow I mean

944
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
Yeah it would be really like

945
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
If you kill something

946
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Like an animal with a gun

947
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Not really that impressive

948
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Take one out with a bow

949
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Way more impressive

950
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
If you were going out with a knife

951
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,383
You got it right now

952
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
I watch Lost

953
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
I know what it's all about

954
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
It always comes back with a gun

955
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
When lock went out there

956
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
F****** took down a peg

957
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
The Great

958
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Anyway at the point is

959
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,631
Yes we we can we can walk a middle ground because the the reality of the world

960
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,471
Is The Middle on this very episode about

961
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
The idea that

962
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
Centralized banking

963
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,127
Interests are detrimental to the world

964
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
It's not that there

965
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Some sort of globalist

966
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Cabal

967
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
That are that are doing it

968
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,319
But they're not

969
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,159
Like

970
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Is that they all have certain

971
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
Tacit agreement

972
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
But they don't necessarily

973
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Talk about

974
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
But there is always going to be

975
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:50,495
Oh you guys did this will f*** yeah we can do that too illegal s***

976
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
And jumping to

977
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
To Alex's version

978
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Aahat

979
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Bigly

980
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
Eats a big lie

981
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
So whatever you whenever you

982
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,807
Get into the idea that there are Global corporations

983
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Is there a global bank

984
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
That are interested in the profit margin

985
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
Interested in making as much money as they

986
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,255
We can discuss that in terms of

987
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
Regulation

988
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Should be

989
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,375
Are treaties between countries

990
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Should be enforced

991
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,471
For Country should no longer exist

992
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
That's a whole lot of

993
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,335
That's a whole lot of the whole conversation

994
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
That one is

995
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,711
Unreasonable conversation

996
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,759
Just to get back to my point

997
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,319
B b the did the distance between

998
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
That the recognition

999
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Corporations that are out for the bottom line

1000
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Yeah

1001
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
And

1002
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Jumping

1003
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
2

1004
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
They're Satanist

1005
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
And they want to

1006
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,423
And they drink blood because there's adrenaline in it

1007
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,079
It's it's where you is it's where you ruin a legitimate conversation

1008
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Yeah it's like

1009
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:06,783
I don't know who it was but I wanted one of our listeners sent me a message about how

1010
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Through the overseer

1011
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Sensationalism

1012
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,671
Through the fetishization and

1013
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
Satanic Panic asked

1014
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
Service

1015
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
To the idea of the reality

1016
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Crimes against children

1017
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Absolute

1018
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Because you're creating

1019
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,679
False reality where

1020
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
People drink blood and there's

1021
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
There's there's

1022
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
These

1023
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Giant

1024
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Like

1025
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
That demonic orgies and what-have-you right

1026
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
That is not

1027
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Real

1028
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
And when

1029
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,295
You presented is what you're up against

1030
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
You're never going

1031
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
To get through the truth

1032
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,647
Is it there are

1033
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
Done

1034
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Two children

1035
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
Massive

1036
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
And you're never going to

1037
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,631
To the bottom of that you're never going to solve that problem if you focus on

1038
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
This bizarre

1039
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,495
Over Amplified Eyes Wide Shut

1040
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Kind of reality

1041
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
And it is

1042
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:07,199
It is what he does with the banking stuff to it's what he does with all of these problems

1043
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Unsolvable

1044
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
More or less

1045
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Yeah you have no power

1046
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Give me money

1047
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:19,999
Give me

1048
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
It's it's of the

1049
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Best

1050
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,655
Type of scientific bulshit articles that you can read you know the

1051
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,983
The headline is insane and then you read the article and was like

1052
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
No sorry sister said this probably isn't true

1053
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
We're going to make this huge

1054
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
And it was that

1055
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:42,527
Young blood transfusions into the elderly is a good idea I think so

1056
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:48,927
May help Alzheimer's

1057
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,975
Like to finally get ahold of cuz it's like

1058
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,559
Now all

1059
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,119
That's not a transfusion

1060
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,959
Liberals no transfusion

1061
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Cuz it doesn't go in your bloodstream

1062
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,847
That's what they want you to the globalist don't put that out in the white

1063
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:10,687
Papers look look they told you that their plan was 15 years behind

1064
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
That was a false flag to get old people to drink young people's blood okay

1065
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Is interesting

1066
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,671
That that's in the same way that like

1067
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
I don't know the same way that locks

1068
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Gym bars

1069
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
We're cool for a bit in the 90

1070
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:31,167
Feel like there are these things there are these things that like have some sort of like scientific in

1071
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Creed

1072
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
And I

1073
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:36,543
Certainly this point I don't think the Sciences in about putting young blood in you

1074
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,103
But it is interesting in that sense

1075
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
Also Brian can go through a European blood transfusion

1076
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
Did your native blood

1077
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Why not

1078
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Whatever

1079
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
I don't give a s***

1080
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Let's move on

1081
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
I think we all

1082
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,351
No I love Kobe Bryant Kobe was one of my favorites when I was younger

1083
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
Not just as a basketball player but as a human

1084
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,007
Get out there and saw that opioid crisis Rex

1085
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Lord's work

1086
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,871
F*** you man

1087
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,503
When I was young for no reason the New York Knicks were my favorite team cuz I love like

1088
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Anthony Mason

1089
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
The shave things on the side of his head

1090
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
I thought that was really cool and all the guys would say

1091
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:28,767
His bald ass head I thought your favorite team would have been the Celtics cuz they were the last team

1092
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
No also Charles Oakley was really cool

1093
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:38,239
So he was that like badass Enforcer

1094
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
F*** you

1095
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,359
I mean the next original name was the Knickerbockers and we all know

1096
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
The theater

1097
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:49,503
I have no idea to Nickelodeon

1098
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,599
No didn't have something to do with socks

1099
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,183
I feel like it was a very important might have been

1100
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
On this January 6th episode

1101
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,815
What Alex Jones

1102
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
Address point

1103
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,703
Are there are like maybe 15 instances of him saying that Obama said

1104
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:14,335
Yeah instead of getting line with the majority of the public payment which again if you're going to say

1105
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
Quotes

1106
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
You should

1107
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
Quotes right and he's acting as if

1108
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,503
Obama said get in line with me

1109
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
Right and then place the clip

1110
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
Which I think is unwise

1111
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
As a propaganda

1112
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Not a good idea

1113
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,255
You should not play the clip make people search it out cuz you know they're not going to

1114
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:36,095
Course just say what you want to say and move along

1115
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,119
So he doesn't like

1116
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,191
10 time probably in the episode and I left out the other night

1117
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:45,311
The Supercut

1118
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,407
Which is an interesting thing for somebody like him to say considering

1119
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
You want they're going to get in line

1120
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,247
I could make a Supercut

1121
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
But I got I just got to switch

1122
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
So I don't have time

1123
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,647
So for the rest of the episode

1124
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
Amarillo

1125
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
So good so good Mario Odyssey is the best

1126
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
They're also shades of the Odyssey

1127
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
Bennett

1128
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,263
Is that why it's called Mario Mario Odyssey I don't think so cuz there are like a bunch of suitors trying to get p

1129
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,079
That would be awesome that would be amazed

1130
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:24,223
Bowser and like a piranha plant

1131
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,295
Hey that's very important

1132
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
Right

1133
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
Yes

1134
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,183
How Maybe

1135
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
Anyway

1136
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
The rest of the show

1137
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Alex Jones

1138
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Is visited

1139
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Buy a guy

1140
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Play who believes Arrigo

1141
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Can lizards

1142
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
Oh okay

1143
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,103
David Icke David Icke makes a little comeback

1144
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
Really long interview

1145
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
Not important

1146
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
But I just have a few

1147
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,503
So you're the first one where he's

1148
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,807
Give him a little bit of an introduction

1149
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
And gets

1150
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Mobile lock

1151
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
Schedule for months now

1152
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Sure

1153
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,263
He is referring just do that same

1154
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,847
Mo Bamba

1155
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Coming up

1156
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,015
Constantly

1157
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,135
Complaining

1158
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,743
So before he gets

1159
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
It's a little bit

1160
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
It's always a long-ass

1161
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
Yeah before David Icke comes in

1162
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
He has to brag about his own

1163
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
Place in the world a little bit

1164
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
And it's probably

1165
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,543
It furthers this

1166
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,823
Being

1167
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
Being co-opted through flattery

1168
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Siri

1169
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,479
I think that's the entire story of Alex

1170
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
But if 20 years ago bill Klein

1171
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,831
Headquartered Alex

1172
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,207
He never would have listened to Larry Nichols

1173
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,231
It would have been

1174
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,375
He would instead be a triangle a Centrist Democrat

1175
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
And we all know how damaging that could be this podcast would still exist

1176
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
You and I would just switch chairs

1177
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,735
That's an alternate reality

1178
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,671
Will be a struggle for six months and then we both descend into similar insanity

1179
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,839
But you know be fascinating though to like if they had done that story of our friendship is this

1180
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:54,239
Decided to do the same because the first time

1181
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
Oh I'm going to talk to you for the next 6 hours

1182
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
That's low

1183
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:06,783
Buffalo anyway one day we'll do a how we met podcast

1184
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:20,351
About that's the new gameplay

1185
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,911
Talk over

1186
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,471
We could we come up with a couple things like that like

1187
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
How we met

1188
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,311
These these things that are of no interest to anyone

1189
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
We have Larry Nichols on the phone

1190
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
No I know you are in Nicaragua

1191
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,551
How do you think Dan and Ice friendships

1192
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,367
But we were doing some comedy

1193
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,695
Now

1194
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,119
I can't remember their names s***

1195
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,935
Here Alex is bragging

1196
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
If you just flatter him

1197
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
That's all you need to do

1198
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
Like

1199
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,039
Russian high command

1200
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,111
Watch the show

1201
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,975
Flies

1202
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,287
Global warming or Global governance

1203
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,591
Destroyed

1204
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,807
They are tuning into the reality it makes sense to them and then they learn more

1205
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,135
Outside the box

1206
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
So

1207
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,695
That

1208
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,535
Tell me why

1209
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
And then

1210
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
I was like

1211
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,375
I'm going to keep being critical of Putin

1212
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
Until I found out

1213
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
He loves me

1214
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,007
Well clearly Putin's right

1215
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Course

1216
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,103
Wow yeah it's dumb

1217
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:12,479
Does he realize have dummy is I don't think he knows what he's saying

1218
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,831
Play cuz that that clip indicates that he's aware of the

1219
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Trajectory

1220
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,903
Like you wear of the fact that like

1221
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,951
I was critical of food

1222
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,535
High-end Russian

1223
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:31,679
Because he loves me loves all I do is talk about other globalist want to take out

1224
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
1

1225
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:36,031
I mean if you really look at the reality is especially as it relates

1226
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
The oligarch situation

1227
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
Alex is there

1228
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
Completely off

1229
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
In terms of that

1230
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,687
Kickout oligarchs

1231
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:49,087
Cisco

1232
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,767
Did you see the news about the Saudi Prince

1233
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,071
Yeah alright

1234
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
Now if you want it it would

1235
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:07,007
Explain a little bit for the

1236
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,687
Just had a huge

1237
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
And another uncle

1238
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Yeah

1239
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
For corruption charge

1240
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,159
In a bit of a to b a

1241
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
Yeah

1242
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,791
Exactly so if you're going to say it's like that's like saying he got rid of

1243
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
Like no

1244
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
He got rid of

1245
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
Somali

1246
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,471
And he's keeping the ones

1247
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,287
Prince

1248
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,335
Is getting rid of the oligarchs

1249
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Who he doesn't like

1250
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
And he's just going to install

1251
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:50,783
Different ones bunch of apartment buildings in 1999 seized power

1252
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
Kicked out all the guards that wouldn't play ball played ball with the rest of them did a massive Crackdown on the meter

1253
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,999
And then started killing all his attract

1254
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:06,655
A lot of snow like that I made that track record is there and protect

1255
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
Who has

1256
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,591
Time to listen to him everyday

1257
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:19,711
I do a podcast about him everyday and I don't listen to him everyday

1258
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:27,391
I have three f****** hours to listen to this b******* everyday horse nobody lunch doesn't listen

1259
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,487
Best Putin has a guy

1260
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,535
He's hired to listen to Alex Jones

1261
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,375
Maybe only in case like you said something

1262
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
Polonium darts with Adam or whatever

1263
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
Bright

1264
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
He's not listening

1265
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,759
Not monitoring

1266
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,367
Possibly farmed out

1267
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:03,487
This whole idea that people keep telling him we listen

1268
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Write to him

1269
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
He's just

1270
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,935
He's drinking the Kool-Aid

1271
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,215
Remind me

1272
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,359
What hours are

1273
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:25,759
Pretty pretty simple map to do

1274
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:32,159
I don't think the internet is as free and Russia as it is here

1275
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,791
Access to his show at 6 not slightly less free than the internet in China

1276
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:44,191
Terrestrial Leon radio in China

1277
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
I don't think so I don't know

1278
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:54,175
Definitely Hazmat

1279
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,247
I told you this yesterday but comedy

1280
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
Mvid November 4th antifa coverage

1281
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
Matt

1282
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
The guy who hosts

1283
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,231
A radio station in the Chicago suburbs

1284
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,767
That airs Alex Jones

1285
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
Then Alex and passes had them on the show

1286
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,655
It says like

1287
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Chicago

1288
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Justin the suburbs

1289
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
And whatever

1290
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
So

1291
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
He came on

1292
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,383
November 4th broadcast with Rob do

1293
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
And it turns out

1294
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,455
That his signal was down

1295
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
The morning of November 4th

1296
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
And he wasn't on air

1297
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,855
Yeah I was like

1298
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,135
Is it probably

1299
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:39,487
I know that you are Infowars.

1300
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,863
It was a big storm last night

1301
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,727
Bunch of other stuff that some sort of a coincidence I don't know

1302
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,615
There's other stations I don't know

1303
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Free show

1304
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Free show

1305
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Together every late night show has a

1306
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Show interview

1307
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:14,559
Improvised conversations guys he has a boner for not having a

1308
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
And all that I understand

1309
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,655
You want things to be natural in Germann and

1310
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,775
Same thing but at the same time if you're going to have a guy calling in

1311
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
They're going to build a

1312
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,591
False narrative off

1313
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
In the break

1314
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
Talk to him and be like

1315
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
Play along

1316
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,599
Or I mean he's a radio station owner like no.

1317
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
Because we have Sears of Comedy Improv

1318
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
But like comedy

1319
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
Thumbs up

1320
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,375
BFDI Clark

1321
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Freeze up

1322
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
Hahaha

1323
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:04,479
You know they liking it too I liken it to whenever like you're playing a softball game

1324
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
And there's a hit

1325
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,831
And as soon as the ball is in the air someone that plays a second

1326
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,135
Or something like that so everyone knows

1327
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,927
Get the ball to second if you catch

1328
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,463
You know that

1329
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
Sometimes you forget where the runners are

1330
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,303
And in the commercial break

1331
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,095
Rob dudes be like play the second

1332
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:24,191
This is what we're going right

1333
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,239
Now you don't have to say you were sabotage

1334
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Also

1335
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
I get it

1336
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,383
He runs

1337
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Infowars on his radio show

1338
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
Yeah he's indicated or whatever

1339
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
Does not listen to Infowars

1340
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,135
So he's not going.

1341
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,559
Wow and he still doesn't know how to run with a narrative

1342
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,655
I feel like you should be able to jump in at that point

1343
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
For own race

1344
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,543
I told you this is an interview with David Icke

1345
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,823
And I

1346
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,359
Unfortunate clip of David Icke

1347
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,735
Talking about the globalist and what they're doing but it actually

1348
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
In hindsight really applies to Alex

1349
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
Can I call him

1350
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
Dick Van Dyke

1351
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
From now on

1352
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
If you want to I feel good

1353
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,463
Global site

1354
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
Freedom

1355
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,687
In the public

1356
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,991
The reasons why

1357
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,575
And because those reasons are not genuine

1358
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,879
You have to

1359
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,975
You are bringing your system

1360
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,047
By lying and lying and lying

1361
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,607
Man I love that last part

1362
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:03,263
I love that you're bringing in a global

1363
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
If you isolated that clipped

1364
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
Because he's using the second person and talking to Alex

1365
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
A hundred percent agree with

1366
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,223
Because that's where we're having

1367
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,831
No.

1368
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
I'm confused

1369
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,207
Don't Judge David I don't know his name David Icke

1370
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:26,559
Demons

1371
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,887
Look I I think he has a beholding to answer

1372
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Somatic ideas

1373
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,471
We certainly believe the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1374
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Is real

1375
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
You're not telling me I'm not blaming him

1376
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,847
He is a bit of an anti-semite

1377
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
But I think

1378
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
He's mentally ill

1379
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,455
Like it away is it Alex

1380
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Isn't

1381
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,271
Like I always do

1382
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:51,903
He had a weird experience when he was in Peru I think rides on a Mountaintop

1383
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
Frozen in place

1384
01:10:54,207 --> 01:11:00,351
Bunch of things downloaded into him through the

1385
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,703
The reason that I say don't blame him as much as because

1386
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:11,871
I honestly think to a certain extent from the times I've heard him on Infowars that he's

1387
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
Like not thrilled to be there

1388
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,759
Like not that he doesn't like Alex or anything like that but it's just like

1389
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:25,439
Fine I'll play along there is a global oppressive system and why

1390
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
Aliens

1391
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Right

1392
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:31,839
He's also a whatever bulshit

1393
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
To be like fractures

1394
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
It's unclear

1395
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
He's good with it

1396
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,079
In terms of the Trump stuff

1397
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,151
The system but he's not in the same vein as our

1398
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
I don't think

1399
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,735
It's the difference between

1400
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
A crazy

1401
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Pundit in a

1402
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,855
Alex Jones the propaganda

1403
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Cuz he's working

1404
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Towards a specific goal

1405
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
I think David Icke

1406
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,743
Razee pundit

1407
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
I think he's

1408
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
But at the same time

1409
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
A lot of stuff

1410
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,143
She says it's really relevant

1411
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,935
A lot of the stuff that he says

1412
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Is

1413
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,751
Makes sense

1414
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
Some of the points

1415
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Behind it

1416
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
In terms of self-empowerment

1417
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:19,455
Shadow Self and a real self

1418
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,735
And there's some like

1419
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Just

1420
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,319
Self-improvement the ideas that he has

1421
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
So

1422
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,927
You're smart enough to disinfect

1423
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
Your argument

1424
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,511
For not blaming him

1425
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
To do with like

1426
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,327
You disentangled

1427
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
He's just

1428
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
He's trying

1429
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,215
Is that your argument for why I shouldn't even know

1430
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,031
You disentangle the parts of it that are clear like

1431
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Like there's Brandon

1432
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,871
Yeah and some of the ideas

1433
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
AR

1434
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
Okay

1435
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,735
And pretty good right I believe that a lot of the

1436
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,063
Stuff that he says Federer that's real f*****-up and negative

1437
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Especially the

1438
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
Space lizards

1439
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:02,719
The protocols that sort of stuff that comes out of brain dead

1440
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
I think it's much more

1441
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
Fear when you look

1442
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
In-N-Out

1443
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,143
Most thinking people can look at him and he's like

1444
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,471
He believes there are legit shape-shifting space lizards

1445
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,799
Much easier to look at him and be like

1446
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
I'm going to f****** either not listen

1447
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,639
You or discount those parts of you

1448
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Where is

1449
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,711
And he's not working towards a specific

1450
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
Goal

1451
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
I guess

1452
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
Self

1453
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,647
Preservation

1454
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,207
No not for himself but for you

1455
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
Motivational speaker actualization with his

1456
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
Not fine with his Mountain

1457
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,959
But you're fine with him as a human being

1458
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,775
So long as his nonsense comes from a

1459
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
Altruistic place

1460
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:54,175
No no I mean he's a con man in a lot of ways

1461
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,967
Through through just Vinny

1462
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
Because you need to have people

1463
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
Throw your money in Courthouse

1464
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,111
Crazy alien

1465
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,695
Yeah but his career he could have done with Alex

1466
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,999
He could have settled down

1467
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
Don't radio show

1468
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,839
And started selling weird supplement

1469
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,375
I probably made

1470
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Killing office

1471
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Instead

1472
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,215
He's written a bunch of book

1473
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
He's gone out and slip

1474
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
Submitted to public scrutiny

1475
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:25,151
In a way that most people would not allow

1476
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:30,783
Like lectures and stuff like that where people mock him and attack him

1477
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,623
Dumb dumb

1478
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
Somewhat it's

1479
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,207
It's not even just to that

1480
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
It's that

1481
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Look

1482
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,327
I believe Alex Jones what motive

1483
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,143
In a large part does come from Mental Health

1484
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,959
Yeah it comes from a place of like

1485
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Deprivation is a

1486
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:55,103
A child feeling

1487
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
Thanks yeah absolutely

1488
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
I am

1489
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,223
For some reason

1490
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Are less offense

1491
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
I don't understand that I'd like to think we would launch into a I'm headed to spend David

1492
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:18,399
That's always my favorite my favorite conversations

1493
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,239
Don't know if I want to do this

1494
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
I don't know why I'm doing this

1495
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,567
Somehow I ever

1496
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
Do I do I do think so

1497
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,711
I do I do believe it's always a matter of degree

1498
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Crazy enough

1499
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,135
To not be responsible for his actions

1500
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,927
It's not even crazy enough

1501
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
Tanabe response

1502
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,743
For the actions what I think is

1503
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,887
This might be weird but it's what popped into my head and I think it I think it might be where I draw the line

1504
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Okay

1505
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,935
Alex Jones

1506
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,775
With a little bit of self-awareness

1507
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
And good decision

1508
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
Could go to therapy

1509
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,151
And work through some of these issue

1510
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
I don't think David I could

1511
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
I think he has brain.

1512
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
Okay

1513
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
And I think

1514
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
That the brain damaged part of ham

1515
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,159
Is the part that is

1516
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,183
And maybe this is

1517
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,047
Blue Sky Thinking on my part Rose Colored Glasses

1518
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,887
I think that the brain damage is the part that believes in the protocols of the elders

1519
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
Zion

1520
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
The part that believes in

1521
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,215
Space lizard

1522
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
And what have you

1523
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,799
And it would I choose to believe in

1524
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Again

1525
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,871
Might be wrong is that the other part

1526
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
The pretty empowering

1527
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,991
The pretty self-actualizing motivation

1528
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
Speaker part

1529
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,807
Been there all along

1530
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,903
But I also don't think that whatever he have going on

1531
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
Therapy could ever help

1532
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
Open leave Alex

1533
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,999
Could be helped

1534
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
Maybe not now but in the past

1535
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,351
Okay Isaac David like probably hated

1536
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Alright

1537
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
This is a

1538
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
Huge conversation to have

1539
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,799
I got your realize how big you just

1540
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:06,175
You just open this out

1541
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:11,039
I mean like the first thing I thought whenever you were talking about brain damage and

1542
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:17,439
It's extent to personal responsibility keep this conversation within like

1543
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,767
The first thought I had was f****** Aaron Hernandez

1544
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
And Chris Benoit

1545
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,583
You know what I'm saying

1546
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:28,447
Which which is an interesting conversation in as far as like

1547
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
How

1548
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,567
How much can you hold these guys responsible for brain

1549
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
Just clearly what was going on

1550
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
Right like there's

1551
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:43,039
Clearly brain-damaged like any NFL player end up murdering

1552
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,319
People

1553
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,647
Like it's really hard to hold

1554
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:51,231
Any NFL player accountable for their actions simply because

1555
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,023
Clearly your brain is

1556
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,327
Damn can I take a step back

1557
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
Answered of refine the argument please do

1558
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
I think one

1559
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:03,007
Since you're legitimately harming other people my argument

1560
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,823
Right because I do I don't think that

1561
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,687
Speaking specifically in terms of espousing belief

1562
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,479
As opposed to

1563
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,039
Killing your family

1564
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,159
It's like different there at least in terms of intensity or Vale

1565
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:26,815
But see then you get into the then get into the concept of what ultimately is more.

1566
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,631
Damaging like what is what is more damaging

1567
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:35,519
Somebody with a mental with brain damage like Chris Benoit or somebody with brain damage like Alex Jones

1568
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,919
Who is influenced so many more people in such a larger negative

1569
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,527
Smaller more focused destroyed my argument cuz I'm just reflecting

1570
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,903
Me know and are the past the past of our podcast.

1571
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975
Documented brain damage on Alex's party

1572
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,047
I think

1573
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,495
It is is I think

1574
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
The David Icke

1575
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,287
Is less noxious

1576
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,335
I think that there is

1577
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,127
More that can be gained

1578
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
Rum ham

1579
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
For sure

1580
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:20,575
I think if you listen to his wife I have I listened to a bunch of them

1581
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:24,415
Run at the same time there's a bunch of stuff that's like

1582
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,463
Well that's like I mean

1583
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,303
The Pendragon

1584
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
And Kerry Cassidy

1585
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:35,167
Right right out there

1586
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,287
But God damn it if they don't believe that they're good people and act like good people for the most part

1587
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
They just espouse

1588
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,359
Such

1589
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:48,223
Ideas you're right you're like I don't understand how to reconcile those two you know

1590
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
I think in the end you're probably right

1591
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
I still want to hold on to whether it's right or wrong

1592
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
That David Icke

1593
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,671
Is not nearly as bad as I

1594
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,767
Purely statistical level

1595
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,583
I agree with you but I also in terms of like

1596
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,655
I don't think that David Icke has a

1597
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
Goal in mind

1598
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
I think Alex

1599
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
Does whether or not

1600
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
He believes it's

1601
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
Nefarious

1602
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Like

1603
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,896
Beaver like just wants you to f******

1604
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,200
Recognize that everything is b*******

1605
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,248
Like wake up

1606
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:28,416
The TV is brainwashing and stuff like that

1607
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
Is what we're having right now

1608
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
Gotcha more or less

1609
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Anyway

1610
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
Which is why

1611
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
Riveting podcast

1612
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,960
But let me say this it's appropriate that you and I have embarked on this conversation

1613
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,800
Because in this neck

1614
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Clip

1615
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Alex Jones is struggling

1616
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
With the fact

1617
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:52,224
Vicki agrees with a David icon so much.

1618
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,760
Cuz I don't know

1619
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,880
David Icke talks about space lizards

1620
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,208
I should I agree with daylight and getting close to being like

1621
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
Oh am I an idiot

1622
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
It doesn't matter

1623
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
What's up

1624
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Please just

1625
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,064
Going back and forth

1626
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
I believe it daily

1627
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
But I believe it's human a lie

1628
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:40,352
Reasonable is a facsimile of the conversation

1629
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,656
Exactly

1630
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:49,312
They just if they haven't you got to give it to some sort of weird intuitive ethics conversation

1631
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
I'd like okay

1632
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,896
So long as we're talking about aliens

1633
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:58,272
I can have a reasonable right right

1634
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,856
Is like as long as we are taking it out of the real world

1635
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,928
Where I don't have any emotional investment in

1636
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,768
If your team is

1637
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
Pro-human

1638
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Then you just start talking about reasonable s***

1639
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
As opposed to

1640
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,472
Science fiction as

1641
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
As always had a

1642
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,104
An easier time of allegory

1643
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,176
You don't need direct 10 science fiction

1644
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
Predictive programming to the dreams of

1645
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,344
Will Shakespeare

1646
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,744
The Show Goes On

1647
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,096
To be clear most of it is not really all that worth

1648
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
Garbage

1649
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
It's fine it's not it is what it is

1650
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
David Icke

1651
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:54,080
Like putting out his positions and right

1652
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
Yeah it's just

1653
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,944
It's not that good so we move on now to January 7th

1654
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
The next day

1655
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Yeah Thursday

1656
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
And

1657
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
He's moved on

1658
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,832
From his

1659
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,392
Getting low

1660
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
Misquoting

1661
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
Get in line with me

1662
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
Not a quote

1663
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,840
Yeah and so here is

1664
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,864
Here is

1665
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
Where he goes

1666
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
The next day

1667
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:25,824
Maury 2016

1668
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,224
Barack Hussein Obama

1669
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,112
The enemy of this constitutional republic

1670
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:42,720
Broadcast to the back when is Vanna Rite

1671
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,792
So couple

1672
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Does Ryan

1673
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,168
How long is he been Speaker of the House

1674
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,192
Well here's the thing

1675
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:54,240
The only reason I know it's Paul Ryan

1676
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,312
Is because in the narrative that we've been going over with Alex

1677
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,848
Yeah Boehner was this

1678
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,920
Speaker at metallic pretended that all of the Patriot

1679
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,968
Tea party types

1680
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Got to play ball

1681
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:10,112
He knows he knows where the power is

1682
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Except

1683
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Dumber somehow

1684
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
Younger and Dumber

1685
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,144
Paul Ryan is such a disappointment

1686
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,360
Alex and the thing I wanted

1687
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,128
The point out was

1688
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,712
Does the Geist is another one of his attempt

1689
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
To create like a cat's fur

1690
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,040
Like he's doing now with the

1691
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
Get tomorrow's news today

1692
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,392

Today

1694
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
But that was another attempt

1695
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,072
Letgo

1696
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,888
Going to cover a couple up

1697
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,960
This is another thing I want to make a Supercut of

1698
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
But I didn't

1699
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
Because it would be too difficult

1700
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,872
I bought a switch so

1701
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,760
I'm going to play this clip

1702
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
That

1703
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,576
He says this

1704
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
Times throughout the

1705
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,520

Over

1707
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
The top

1708
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,944
So from Akon

Constitutional scholar

There is a that guy

1711
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,784
Definitely committed all the crimes

1712
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,904
About Obama crime

1713
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,976
He committed while in office

1714
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
I'm going to get to this no matter what

1715
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,584
Sorel 75

1716
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,192
Do you think he even got 21

1717
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,104
Supposed to do the fourth hour he calls

1718
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,224
6 Arab dude doesn't Alex Jones without ever talking about this article

1719
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,272
He says over and over again

1720
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
I'm going to get that is article

1721
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:20,416
We're going to get to this no matter what I'm going to stay here if I have to do

1722
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,464
Never get to even one now

1723
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,816
I can read it

1724
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
Either that

1725
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm so

1726
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:34,240
I didn't even remember how many of these

1727
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,776
I can't even remember them

1728
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,800
First of all

1729
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Second

1730
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Did not read this article

1731
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:49,856
Imallexx

1732
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,160
Daniel think he's Martin Luther

1733
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,072
Might as well

1734
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,912
Episode

1735
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
IWatch

1736
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
The lives

1737
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
November 4th

1738
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,592
Antifa protests

1739
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:15,968
Right took over and there's a lot of 1488

1740
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,112
There's a lot of Nazi messages a lot of kill the Jews messages in chat room

1741
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,160
I saw that you got to count to trolls

1742
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,744
Certainly I'm not going to say that every single one of them was sincere

1743
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,048
But boy was a lot of people

1744
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
It was a lot of people

1745
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
And let's

1746
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,424
Listen to this next clip

1747
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,192
With that in

1748
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,264
They are the most

1749
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
Evil enemy by

1750
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,480
The globalist

1751
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,528
I mean

1752
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
What about him

1753
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,136
Was

1754
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,976
Moral good person

1755
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,280
And Hitler was super dark

1756
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,096
Mount

1757
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,192
Bisquick goes on butt

1758
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
So many different comparisons

1759
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
Totally

1760
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Why did you say

1761
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,872
I don't know

1762
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,712
Well guys choose Hitler is always to make

1763
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
Hitler look

1764
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,064
Better

1765
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
I didn't I don't want to save this

1766
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,184
Before the clip plays but I might as well he's doing a little bit of Hitler apology

1767
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
In this

1768
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,304
I mean anytime that your rhetoric is like

1769
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:41,728
These people has great compared to them it's generally softening or

1770
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:47,360
The name of the cliff I have here is Alex's soft on Hitler

1771
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,664
Just Pizza

1772
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,432
But listen

1773
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Listen to this

1774
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Also there's

1775
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
Is a ton of long pauses

1776
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
Cuz you can see in his face like

1777
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,720
You know sometimes like I was feeling it during the day but icon

1778
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,256
Conversation

1779
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
Thing I'd probably

1780
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,584
I don't know if I have

1781
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,120
Skills right now to go

1782
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
Get through this

1783
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
There's a look on his face of like

1784
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,752
I know the point I'm trying to

1785
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,312
This is why

1786
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,592
I don't know

1787
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,896
It's the journey not the destination

1788
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
And I do not know how I'm going to get

1789
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,040
I'm wondering if there's a lot of long pauses along the way

1790
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
The UK

1791
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,864
Norse countries

1792
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,264
The Elise

1793
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,176
Twisted Fork

1794
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:57,504
But enjoy torturing people to death

1795
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,648
Where's Nang

1796
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Kettler

1797
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,560
Yeah

1798
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
Picked up

1799
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Technology

1800
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,752
Good morning

1801
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,288
Social control

1802
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,104
Actor

1803
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,904
Nazi rally

1804
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,792
Rally's

1805
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,584
When did America

1806
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
We talked

1807
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
About that

1808
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,544
Unnecessary

1809
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Patsy

1810
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,128
Yeah

1811
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:03,552
The Proto globalist

1812
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
All just

1813
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:12,000
One thing to agree on Hitler was bad

1814
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,304
From

1815
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,376
As a starting point for maybe that's the issue

1816
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
Which human beings

1817
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
Is we can't even agree

1818
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,728
On how bad

1819
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:26,592
Genocide in his chat room I'll tell you that right now

1820
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,920
No the thing is what he's talking about is

1821
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
Things like

1822
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:39,392
With all these things mixed up

1823
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,720
But with the Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood stuff

1824
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:43,744
Like

1825
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
Do you can find

1826
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
And a picture of her

1827
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,144
In front of the Klan rally

1828
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:55,264
Permission

1829
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
Men's Reproductive Rights

1830
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,824
And she's like

1831
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,360
There are racist women

1832
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:04,480
Are they still need help they still need a health care

1833
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
That is such

1834
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,064
F******

1835
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
Frazee

1836
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,416
Misrepresentation of like you were saying through the clip

1837
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
Yep

1838
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,024
There is truth to the idea that Hitler got a lot of ideas from America

1839
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Yeah

1840
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,888
But then to take it to

1841
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,912
Ovens

1842
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,960
Parenthood Margaret Sanger

1843
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,984
That's

1844
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
Disingenuously

1845
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,800
Right that's that's

1846
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
The propaganda leap

1847
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Alex Mae

1848
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:34,688
Expect like look at the beginning of the episode

1849
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,968
You went from

1850
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,272
A conversation that should be had

1851
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
Which should be taught

1852
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
In school

1853
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,648
The idea that Hitler didn't act in a vacuum

1854
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
Right

1855
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
No

1856
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,560
The ideas existed

1857
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,120
Certainly for thousands of years

1858
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,216
Because there were many exoduses through country has really

1859
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Hold on

1860
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:06,944
What about the people you know my grandpa was a man

1861
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,736
Did you know that

1862
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:13,856
I didn't know that you text people

1863
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,392
Sure but like

1864
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
HD

1865
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,000
It's this fascinating weird

1866
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:20,768
It's almost

1867
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,072
I was going to try and related somehow to be

1868
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:23,840
Uncanny valley

1869
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
But that's not

1870
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,912
But like there is this

1871
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,448
This area where Alex

1872
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Cuz like

1873
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
Eunos

1874
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
Good point

1875
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
And then makes it back

1876
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
Right there

1877
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:41,504
Well I meant it goes back to stuff that I keep saying and I might disagree with in other

1878
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Other contacts

1879
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,064
There is the Opera

1880
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
Tunity IC

1881
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
Of course

1882
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,672
Never has happened and never will

1883
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
But like there's

1884
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,256
The constant opportunity to be the hero

1885
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,816
Like he could have at any point

1886
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
Been like

1887
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,864
IC

1888
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,144
A problem

1889
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,192
Yeah

1890
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,264
Actually actually read the articles that he talks about

1891
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
How could he

1892
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:07,616
But those could have been like an actually good voice

1893
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,408
It ain't been like

1894
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,200
You could have shaped the

1895
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
Skeptic

1896
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,272
Conspiracy community

1897
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
I know those are two different

1898
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,112
He could have shaped a lot of the

1899
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,392
Those people have

1900
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
In a much more healthy

1901
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,744
Much more reasonable way as opposed

1902
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,512
To the

1903
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:27,328
The race-baiting the bigotry the

1904
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
Anti-liberal bashing

1905
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,400
He does now

1906
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
Doesn't make as much money and that should get

1907
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,616
Thinking more specifically

1908
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Like Margaret Sanger

1909
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Went

1910
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,992
Talk to the KKK women

1911
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,784
Yeah not

1912
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
DeMent words

1913
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
But

1914
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,464
But it is like

1915
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:00,608
With the the conversation that was always had during so many different elect

1916
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,376
Kansas like

1917
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,936
Would you have a diplomatic meeting with

1918
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,472
North Korea

1919
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
With no restriction

1920
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:07,776
And their whatever

1921
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,616
Would you have a diplomatic meeting or f****** Fred Hampton

1922
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,432
The it mean if you want to talk about Chicago

1923
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,712
The

1924
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,736
Patrons

1925
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,272
Of Chicago should be Fred

1926
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,808
Yeah and

1927
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,344
Genius

1928
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Was

1929
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,904
He went and talked to everybody

1930
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,976
He went and talked to white supremacist

1931
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
Fred Hampton

1932
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,096
Black Panther leader

1933
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,632
And you know what he talked about

1934
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,472
He talked about s*** the same way that everybody would talk about s***

1935
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,752
And the point is

1936
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:43,872
That he would communicate with them in a way that they could understand.

1937
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:47,456
Really important that you know the old adage of like we don't make

1938
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,736
Peace with our friends

1939
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,016
We make peace with our aunt

1940
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
And yet at the same time

1941
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
If you wanted to be a dick

1942
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,416
You could pull up app

1943
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,976
Picture of Fred Hampton talking to

1944
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Justin be like

1945
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
But this guy's white supremacy

1946
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:07,168
Totally know there's no win if you do that if people are

1947
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
So obsessed with

1948
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,240
Fighting a war

1949
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,288
Regardless of who is again

1950
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:16,128
Regardless of how many people died regardless of the lost on Earth

1951
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
So how it's bought

1952
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,992
It's going to be something that you use against

1953
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,016
Totally

1954
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:27,392
Which is why Kissinger should be killed again

1955
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,256
Also they're appropriate analog

1956
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,280
In this

1957
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
What's January 20th

1958
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,376
16

1959
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,656
You talked to Louis Farrakhan

1960
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:41,728
Conwright and the entire time it's mostly just trying

1961
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
And score points

1962
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,056
I've listened to most of the interview so spoiler alert

1963
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,896
We don't go over it but most of the stuff that Alex ends up playing

1964
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,432
Is the stuff that is like

1965
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,712
Living life

1966
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
I am Trump

1967
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:55,808
Yeah you're he uses it as like a bolstering

1968
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,832
Trump thing

1969
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,904
That's not legitimate

1970
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,184
Conversation with the

1971
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,976
People who disagree with you first that's

1972
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,768
Trying to use them as a prop

1973
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
No

1974
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,096
Define Louis Farrakhan

1975
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,376
Like I'm not I'm not

1976
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
These note David Icke

1977
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:27,040
Anyway let's let's get onto this.

1978
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,696
Good points

1979
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:37,792
Louis Farrakhan does to absolutely espouses a lot of good self reliance

1980
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,584
Slot of self-empowerment

1981
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,912
Yeah exactly what I was saying about David Icke

1982
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,216
Small for soft on that

1983
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:51,360
But at the same time crazy

1984
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,200
Uh-oh also

1985
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,736
I8

1986
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
You know I ate I was aware of it

1987
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,856
And I've said this so many times

1988
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
It is really hard to get away

1989
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,440
Now

1990
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,976
From the knowledge that

1991
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,072
Just about everything these crazy people believe

1992
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,400
Eventually boils down to hate the Jews

1993
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,800
Whether or not that is their primary motivation it's somewhere in there don't even necessarily

1994
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,824
Always know that

1995
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Important

1996
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,200
I think that a lot of people

1997
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:32,576
Particularly a lot of those folks were probably in that chat room probably just think it's like

1998
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
Duh

1999
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
Yeah of course

2000
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:37,952
Evil

2001
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
That's

2002
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
So

2003
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,168
David Icke is on the show and

2004
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:53,312
Self-actualization

2005
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:58,432
Beholden to the protocols of the Elders of Zion and has a lot of aunties

2006
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,224
He is a guest on Alex Jones Show

2007
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,272
Now think about the two stunts

2008
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,552
Interviews that Alex is done

2009
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
In the last

2010
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
Gear of us cover

2011
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,392
There's David Duke

2012
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,720
And Louis Farrakhan right the two of them have in common

2013
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,768
Super against the Jews

2014
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,792
Interested

2015
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
Interesting

2016
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,400
I really wish the Unabomber

2017
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Wasilla

2018
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,728
Cuz he would be an amazing

2019
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
Who cares

2020
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,592
Yuri amazing Gaston

2021
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:32,992
Social media

2022
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,272
Although you loves to use it

2023
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
And brag about his numbers

2024
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,856
Loves people in the middle of nowhere

2025
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:44,000
On the lam Unabomber knew where the height his f****** guns I'll tell you that right now

2026
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,304
Is living on the land

2027
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,864
That's important

2028
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,448
On the land

2029
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Cuz we're about to

2030
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,496
Get to another interview

2031
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,312
Does Joel skousen

2032
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Who's out on the

2033
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,360
Michelle now

2034
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384
Not a fan of his name

2035
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:05,248
Whatever is Mancow

2036
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,600
The right Lord mandolin

2037
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,904
Search Joel skousen comes on the

2038
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
And

2039
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,232
Ostensibly the interview is about

2040
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
The Bundys

2041
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,304
Because at this point

2042
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
In January 20th

2043
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,120
This is when they were

2044
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,168
Taking over The Wildlife Refuge

2045
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,776
There was only one that killed

2046
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,080
Yeah there was that

2047
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,152
Finnegan or something like that

2048
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Yeah yeah

2049
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:40,320
Imagine if native

2050
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
Takin Over

2051
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,392
They would all have been dead

2052
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
They would all of them

2053
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,512
Or at least way more of them.

2054
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:53,120
Like me to take deaf out of it no negotiation

2055
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:59,776
We come back to over and over again is the idea of why you're being like

2056
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,568
Minority baby being Criminal

2057
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,872
Absolutely

2058
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,152
You look at the difference

2059
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,944
Greenhow the Bundy Ranch

2060
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
Nothing

2061
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,016
The standoff The Wildlife Preserve

2062
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,040
How's that was

2063
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,320
Treated versus

2064
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,368
The people at the pipeline

2065
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:19,488
The people at the Wildlife Preserve

2066
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,280
Hangout Baron

2067
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:27,680
So I can do whatever for like a week more than mad I don't even remember how long it lasted

2068
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:35,616
No one at the pipeline had a guy that's why they got hoes

2069
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:39,968
No just been killed maybe everybody should have guns

2070
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,760
No I don't think so cuz

2071
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,784
That

2072
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
Is a fallacy

2073
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
See if that helps

2074
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,112
Because

2075
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,928
With minorities

2076
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,976
Escalation

2077
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,000
Calm down

2078
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,048
Calm down

2079
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,328
Be cool

2080
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,120
Alright

2081
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,216
You know the skin color crayon

2082
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:04,288
You know how it's white skin color

2083
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,872
Let's just drive

2084
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,152
White skin on a

2085
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,176
You're talking about ask

2086
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
Scandal that happened in

2087
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,992
Early 90s

2088
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,016
I know it look

2089
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:21,440
Almost no time I know that that was a terrible decision

2090
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
Pain where in they were

2091
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,744
Hugely races

2092
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,024
Paul Joseph Watson

2093
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,304
Fishing report about that

2094
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,888
Can't imagine how you say the word interesting and have it makes aw

2095
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,936
Swing by Joel skousen

2096
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,960
Is on

2097
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,520
And they're talking about the Bund

2098
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,824
Yeah let's just move past my white face

2099
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,920
Space idea

2100
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:46,016
That is in the vein of Rodger Stone wanting to regulate Twitter

2101
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,600
Apparently David Knight is now come out talking about regulating Facebook

2102
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:55,744
Excellent good ideas and we should apply them to the tech industry as a whole and that weight no they didn't say that

2103
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,512
No

2104
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:05,216
Taking away the great betrayal by the BLM

2105
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:14,944
And then stand down they would have the highground people say yeah they're not a bunch of crazy

2106
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,968
Well they are crazy

2107
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,552
What do you what is 1000

2108
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,088
Is largely

2109
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,112
Unionization

2110
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
Regulating

2111
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,952
Those are

2112
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,536
It goes back to the same thing we see over and over again

2113
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,072
I'm against this

2114
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:34,144
Intellitime Gisela

2115
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,192
Bobby Q

2116
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,984
Yeah

2117
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,288
But it's nonsense

2118
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,824
And Archimedes

2119
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,384
Incredibly difficult for us to have because

2120
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,712
Like our position is

2121
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,760
Yeah that makes sense

2122
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:52,064
That makes sense we don't team sport

2123
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:58,464
No and it's like it's like the farmers being able to get together and unionized 4shared

2124
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:03,840
Interest makes total sense absolutely

2125
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,912
Even the idea

2126
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:08,192
Of

2127
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,592
Driving regulation about what the government in terms of land rights

2128
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
What's that

2129
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
But it

2130
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,408
They are

2131
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,480
Like

2132
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,528
Right and that's so frustrating

2133
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,832
Cuz it's not a conversation you can have

2134
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,416
It's the same thing where would like if Alex Jones were to listen to this

2135
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
So much

2136
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:33,280
You guys support Hillary and your dad

2137
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,352
You're dumb liberals now

2138
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:39,936
Did you listen to the show liberals

2139
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,496
It is it worth

2140
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,824
We're too slippery and nuanced

2141
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,360
To fight back against

2142
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,896
A concrete

2143
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,248
Say that the idea of a

2144
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
8/8

2145
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,344
So that's one of the big things beds

2146
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
That always

2147
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
Gets to me

2148
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
Is like

2149
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,208
Regulation is bad

2150
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,232
Until about

2151
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,280
Regulation

2152
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:11,936
Like it works in your favor

2153
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,496
Good liberal

2154
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
Snowflake

2155
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,104
It's always

2156
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,712
The demonization of progressive

2157
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
Is

2158
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,552
A million-fold

2159
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,856
And that's mainly because

2160
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,904
Every part of that demonization

2161
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,952
Is abdicating what it is

2162
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,024
Write like with antifa

2163
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
You can't

2164
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,120
Against antifa

2165
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,912
Verigan's

2166
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,680
Fascism

2167
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:46,752
Write their name

2168
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,080
The only way is to create a

2169
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
Strawman

2170
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,152
Or

2171
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:59,552
And you can imply that their name is ill-advised in Australia the liberal party is

2172
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
Is our conservative

2173
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,856
Right

2174
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,928
Exactly

2175
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,208
But it's

2176
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:09,024
It's so long as you don't know

2177
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,048
What we believe

2178
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,608
How what we will believe will affect you

2179
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,192
And so on and so forth so long as you combine us with

2180
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:21,312
The Communist from Soviet Russia

2181
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,336
As long as it's

2182
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,872
Sounds like it makes sense

2183
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,408
You will believe

2184
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,176
Anything

2185
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:26,944
Damage

2186
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Totally

2187
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,296
It finally does damage

2188
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,112
You know real progressives have some good ideas

2189
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,976
When they apply to anything other than when they apply to me

2190
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:43,328
But also Intel

2191
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,864
Like a Depression happen

2192
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:51,008
Well alright really like the New Deal whenever they couldn't eat

2193
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:54,080
Yeah

2194
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,384
Kicked ass whenever people

2195
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
To death

2196
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:00,480
Amazing important

2197
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,760
It's a good thing we learned it

2198
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
You know we

2199
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,632
We wrestle a little bit with

2200
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,728
Hearing an argument we're kind of okay within that context but

2201
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,544
Yeah

2202
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,896
Did he have to say on this up

2203
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:34,272
Episode and him and Alex get into having a conversation about selling weapons

2204
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,320
Into Syria

2205
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:43,488
And okay

2206
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
What have you

2207
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,816
These are back in the glory

2208
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,120
And she basically is just selling arms

2209
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
To whoever wants

2210
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:55,776
And Joel skousen has a slightly different take on it interesting

2211
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,568
And I actually

2212
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,872
Maybe kind of agree with him

2213
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,408
If I can make one

2214
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
One caveat

2215
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,712
Then I will at the end of this

2216
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
They're getting old

2217
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,976
Is in the USA

2218
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,768
Friendship out of there

2219
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:23,168
TomTom

2220
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,312
Hillary would know what

2221
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:35,712
Going on in the dark side of the dark side

2222
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
George W bush

2223
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:39,296
Didn't know it's dark side of government was doing

2224
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,320
Minister

2225
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:46,976
Politico's know about Darkside operation

2226
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,024
So Joel skousen

2227
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,352
When confronted with the idea that Hillary

2228
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,632
He is selling weapons

2229
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,168
Goes immediately to

2230
01:48:55,424 --> 01:49:01,056
Deep state

2231
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,848
Come on man no of course not

2232
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,384
She might know about that stuff

2233
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,688
Now here's the caveat I'm going to make

2234
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:11,808
It's dangerous for all of us if she knows about it you know who it's not dangerous for though

2235
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:12,832
What's Blackwater

2236
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,696
That's for the caveat I would make

2237
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,976
Interesting point

2238
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:23,328
Seeing that Erik Prince Blackwater have both

2239
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:29,728
Organization and guy who runs organization

2240
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:36,128
In terms of running weapons into countries where it's illegal to sell them

2241
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,664
Cassidy's in slaughtering civilians

2242
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,456
Absolutely it makes sense

2243
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
Like

2244
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,784
I have a clitoris is half an inch higher than you think

2245
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:47,904
It's going to be you're just pushing a quarter quarter

2246
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928
Okay

2247
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:49,696
You mispronounced

2248
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:50,976
Urethra

2249
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:51,744
Megology

2250
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:55,840
I'd like a written apology to trust

2251
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,752
What I'm what I'm hearing from that clip

2252
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,080
If you take away the premise

2253
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
Where is

2254
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,152
Turnpike the government is selling

2255
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:09,920
These missiles

2256
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,688
Do all these go

2257
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,760
If you just let that sit for a second

2258
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
His idea that

2259
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,576
Hillary wouldn't know about that

2260
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:22,976
He's got to be protected from that drove the plausible deniability

2261
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
Yeah that stuff

2262
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,536
Definitely

2263
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,072
I agree

2264
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,912
I don't think that Regan necessarily knew everything that was going on in Iran

2265
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,680
Contra

2266
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
I don't

2267
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,984
Noah's Reagan

2268
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
New

2269
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,544
At that point

2270
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,312
Anything

2271
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,384
Even if he had all his faculties

2272
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,784
I don't I don't think that he would have been like

2273
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,064
Signs of dementia in office

2274
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:52,928
Oh do you mean he was f****** insane cuz that's what it sounds like

2275
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,952
Right right

2276
01:50:55,488 --> 01:51:01,632
Of course of course there are some good play and stuff like that

2277
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
Like a movie though

2278
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:09,824
Like the idea of that part

2279
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,176
Seem to be like I mean the CIA in in time

2280
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:20,576
Right terms of trying to recruit

2281
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:26,208
Not necessarily aware of all of those efforts there were machinations behind

2282
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,000
Too busy

2283
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
What who could blame him

2284
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,888
He was a Playboy

2285
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
That's a good question

2286
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:42,336
Sins of our time

2287
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:46,688
AR

2288
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,248
The only question I could think of

2289
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:57,952
Who is Maggie Simpson everybody does like also from that era type questions

2290
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,280
I don't remember when I'm gone I have no idea

2291
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,608
All before I was born

2292
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:08,960
I love the fact that we're weird enough to pull out a Dallas reference

2293
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,032
Which was 20 years before we were born

2294
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,592
Yeah yeah but it isn't made its marks

2295
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:20,480
And up much like save the cheerleader save the world that reference 20 years from now

2296
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:23,040
I doubt it but like

2297
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
Look

2298
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:30,464
I don't know a little bit just so I can make my argument that I think with Joel skousen

2299
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,000
Talkin about is Blackwater

2300
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,560
Like those sorts of organizations

2301
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:39,424
It seems like those would be the people who have access to high-grade munitions

2302
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,800
Which is the entire point of their existence is they are not

2303
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,128
Under Federal oversight

2304
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,408
It's like money laundering

2305
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,736
Joel skousen

2306
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,040
Hillary wouldn't be involved in this

2307
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,576
Who would

2308
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:59,648
That's the next question a real journalist would ask

2309
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,416
Alex

2310
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:04,512
Just wants to go back to Hillary and Bill

2311
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,048
If Hillary wasn't involved

2312
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,632
How was Hillary involved with this

2313
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,936
She was totally involved

2314
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:15,264
Videos

2315
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,128
Actual answer me

2316
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:26,528
Hilarious that's all 33,000 emails have you seen this

2317
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:30,624
Bellies like so close and then you go away

2318
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,928
Socks

2319
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:36,000
No

2320
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
Pretty sure Bill Quinn

2321
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,304
Skyward Sauk

2322
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
Probably dead by now though it's been years

2323
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,656
Not an addict

2324
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,680
Anyway

2325
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:46,240
This weekend of our time with Joel skousen

2326
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,008
Cuz

2327
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:50,592
Mostly about like

2328
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,616
I don't like it

2329
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,664
I like it it's automatic

2330
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,944
Play sounds like scowl

2331
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:01,344
You want to put an L in there and I don't think there is one I think it's scouser

2332
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,112
Current flavor for me

2333
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:08,512
Like he belongs in this category of Infowars guest

2334
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,792
And man it sucks

2335
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,352
Because I'm saying like some stuff that you're going to

2336
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,632
Clown on me for

2337
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:16,192
The listeners aren't going to like

2338
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,520
I don't I

2339
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,848
When Joel skousen is on the show I mostly to now

2340
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,152
He's not really that bad

2341
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,432
In terms of

2342
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,456
Is Belize

2343
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:31,808
You have a lot of like dumb geopolitical ideas and write like that

2344
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,344
In terms of like

2345
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,392
Like red flags

2346
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:41,024
About Bracken has red flags all over it whenever he shows up I'm like I got to listen

2347
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,304
Int always like

2348
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,096
I realize this

2349
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,376
This actually pisses me off

2350
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
Yeah about my cell

2351
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,984
Okay on our last episode we talked about Matt Bracken

2352
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,008
Appearance

2353
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
On the show

2354
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,544
Sammy racks

2355
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,080
And I talked about how

2356
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,360
That is what

2357
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:58,176
Media Matters should be talkin about more than

2358
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
The

2359
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,224
Linda sarsour

2360
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:00,992
Course

2361
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:04,064
And I realized when I went back and listen to it but I forgot to

2362
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:04,832
Play a clip

2363
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,368
I don't have the clip

2364
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:08,160
Okay but I could go get it

2365
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:08,928
And now I can't go

2366
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,696
Cuz times up

2367
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,792
I'll get it on the next episode

2368
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:18,144
You can find episode

2369
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,168
But I

2370
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,192
That's all

2371
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,008
No one's listening

2372
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,032
Can listen to an Alex

2373
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:29,664
Jones episode and motivated me to be like this is so much more bigoted

2374
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,456
Linda sarsour

2375
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:34,016
Yes was that Matt Bracken got into

2376
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
F******

2377
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,576
Who's it going hard

2378
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,344
About

2379
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,624
The overbreeding

2380
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,768
And the idea that white people are going to be bred out

2381
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:52,192
The argument that Liberals are mad and islamist

2382
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:56,032
Should be mad because this guy went and ran a truck into people

2383
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
When is

2384
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,616
You just chill out we're going to out breed them

2385
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,224
Boy

2386
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,248
Not tasty

2387
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,528
Not tasty as Narcan

2388
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,576
So they're people like that like mad bracket

2389
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,880
And then there were people like

2390
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,184
Like David Icke where I'm like

2391
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:15,232
I did go crazy

2392
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:21,632
But arms distance

2393
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656
Yep Joel skousen

2394
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,936
Like I think he is

2395
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,704
Wrong

2396
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,728
About a lot of stuff

2397
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:29,312
Yeah but also I don't hate him he's a sort of a nebulous concept

2398
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,592
Where is Lake Harriet

2399
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:31,616
Harry dent

2400
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,432
Or Peter Rhea

2401
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:38,784
Rare terrible later Max Keiser is going to show up

2402
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,576
I think I might like men

2403
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:47,488
I understand where you coming from with this here's the problem

2404
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:53,888
The bar is so low your you're in a world where

2405
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:57,216
All you have to do to be a Centrist is just

2406
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,800
The juice

2407
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:05,152
Like that's that's your world or mine

2408
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:11,296
You know me and all of the rest of us who don't listen to Alex Jones

2409
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:14,880
Every single day over being Dan the Centrist

2410
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,416
It's right you love to do

2411
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,952
Not least of which because you

2412
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,000
Love guns and want everybody to have them

2413
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:25,632
I want everybody Centrist position that you can have

2414
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:33,824
Kind of a situation where your perspective

2415
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,384
True relative

2416
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:38,688
Horrific mess of Alex Jones

2417
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:43,552
Yeah that that that is definitely fair

2418
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:48,928
Nobody's clowning on like their very eyes they dislike you it's just we live in different

2419
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,488
There is no counting for like

2420
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:55,072
The the fact that we've been doing this for now

2421
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:57,376
A little over ten bucks

2422
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,384
Going over this and most most

2423
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,688
But most of the time we like

2424
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,224
We go over these episodes

2425
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,504
And I don't even include

2426
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,320
The portions of other like Paul Joseph Watson being

2427
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:17,344
Bulshit

2428
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,624
And stuff like that

2429
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,904
You guys were listening

2430
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,928
80 Eudora

2431
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,208
Realize

2432
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:25,792
The vitriol that isn't included in the show

2433
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:29,120
I am more than its own more than aware that

2434
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
Sometimes

2435
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,936
You are out to protect

2436
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:38,336
So Joel skousen is okay but all that protected the show so I don't yell 414

2437
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,104
You can take you with me

2438
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:43,200
I guess my point in that is also prepper

2439
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
Pretoria because

2440
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:47,552
In a little bit we will get to Max Keiser

2441
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:49,856
There's an interview with him

2442
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,904
At the end of the show that I think is fascinate

2443
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:55,232
It's mostly about him being in favor of Bitcoin

2444
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:57,792
Alex being like we don't know

2445
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,840
Right

2446
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:05,984
Actually I'm not just when maxpoint started he doesn't pimp it at all

2447
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:12,384
Just talks about how they cryptocurrencies are they just going to cells in terms of

2448
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:18,784
Yeah I don't know why you don't trust Alex

2449
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,856
He makes sense and at the same time

2450
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,136
Cryptocurrency

2451
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,416
Anytime soon

2452
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,952
Paper

2453
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,000
On paper it does exist

2454
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:30,048
Does it does seem to work

2455
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,352
I'm also not

2456
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,424
I will change I will change over

2457
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,448
More

2458
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:39,008
Things that were convenient in my life

2459
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,336
We're relevant

2460
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:43,616
Right

2461
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,152
Like I don't like

2462
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,456
Amazon but I use it because

2463
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:50,272
Amazon hate Apple

2464
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:53,088
But I have a f****** iPhone

2465
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:57,696
I don't use Amazon I don't use Uber any of those things like I

2466
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,976
Hate Corporation

2467
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,536
And I do have an iPhone and I shouldn't

2468
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,816
But I can't

2469
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:05,120
Like there's a part of me is you don't want a Samsung

2470
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,424
I can't survive without a knife I don't want to f******

2471
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,472
Zeus

2472
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:14,080
MacBook Pro I've got an iPhone

2473
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,616
Write all myself

2474
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:22,016
Is there social media

2475
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:24,832
Make a deal with it on some level

2476
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,648
Personally I have not been happier

2477
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,464
Since when I left Facebook and Twitter

2478
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:37,120
I don't use my personal account really at all right I'm much happier than when I would look through people's posts tonight

2479
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:48,384
Used to care about that and then I started going through lineups and I was like

2480
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:53,760
Oh I no longer like I used to feel jealousy and I no longer feel jealous

2481
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:58,368
I have no idea about, so

2482
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,648
Is

2483
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:04,000
A bizarre reaction to me saying that Joel skousen isn't that bad

2484
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,792
And maybe he is

2485
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:12,192
And I just haven't heard it and I just don't know it I'm going to give

2486
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,728
But let's move on

2487
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,496
He's

2488
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,544
Statistical likelihood

2489
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:17,568
He's a monster

2490
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,104
It seems like most

2491
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:19,872
Of

2492
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,896
His

2493
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:21,920
AR

2494
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:22,944
About prepping

2495
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,736
Yeah which I'm okay

2496
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:25,760
Doomsday prepper

2497
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:29,600
Yeah as long as you're not crazy I'm okay with it you should have water in

2498
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:36,256
You should have water and you should have some sort of food supply like when I was growing up

2499
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,048
We had a basement

2500
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,352
And my parents had a bitter Foods

2501
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:43,936
Supply down there until bottled water

2502
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,728
Your family is crazy

2503
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:50,336
But like for my family was more like about the idea that we lived in Missouri and there were tons

2504
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,104
The tornadoes

2505
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,688
And we might have to hang out in the basement for a week

2506
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
Or something like that

2507
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:58,784
Protomatter

2508
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,064
No matter what

2509
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,344
It's good to be prepared

2510
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,880
Sculpture theoretically

2511
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,696
Get weird whenever you're like

2512
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,488
I'm going to build bomb

2513
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,072
Would it become Central to your identity

2514
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:11,840
That's when it be

2515
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,912
It's like

2516
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,216
View from the lifestyle that

2517
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,752
You would otherwise be living

2518
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:22,336
Right like we need to spend all your money on it all your time

2519
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,896
Make your family do stuff they're uncomfortable with

2520
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:29,248
At the same time it's like a show

2521
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:31,040
Is mostly about like

2522
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,320
Bad marriage

2523
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:38,720
That's what it's mostly about

2524
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,768
Overly motivated husband

2525
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:43,840
It's just another like

2526
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,376
Super weird dad

2527
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,400
Kind of behavior

2528
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:49,472
The guy who super into cars

2529
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:54,080
Is only slightly less insane than the guy who's super into Doom

2530
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,384
Like

2531
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,152
There's not

2532
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,968
I know there is I mean being able to fix

2533
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:00,736
Car is great

2534
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:02,784
And being able to have

2535
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,344
Reply

2536
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,880
With jet goes bad

2537
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:10,208
It's all healthy impulses gone

2538
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:14,304
Maybe that's what the whole show is generally about

2539
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
That's probably what it is

2540
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:20,704
So let's get to this next clip because Max Keiser doesn't show up for a little bit

2541
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,752
Healthy impulsive gone bad

2542
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:24,800
Vodka

2543
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:27,872
So in his nightclub Alex Jones Lament

2544
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:30,176
But he didn't stop Obama

2545
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,456
That f****** guy

2546
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:46,304
You should be

2547
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:53,472
That one

2548
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:01,664
I'm just a gullible idiot I'll be honest with you I wanted to see a black guy

2549
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:08,320
Not true

2550
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
Oh

2551
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:15,488
I just wasn't against human.

2552
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,584
That doesn't track either

2553
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,352
Evil

2554
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,032
That like

2555
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,312
Rambling

2556
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,080
Brain

2557
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,128
Trail

2558
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
Is so racist

2559
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:42,880
I am

2560
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:46,464
I have been you know dyed-in-the-wool

2561
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,000
That my entire life

2562
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,304
Liberal

2563
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,584
Yeah that's

2564
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,656
Hold that whole premise of you grow up in

2565
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:57,216
To become more conservative I don't feel that at all

2566
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,008
You and I you and I were raised from

2567
02:04:59,264 --> 02:04:59,776
I'm very different

2568
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:03,104
Resume doesn't matter

2569
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,152
Because right did come from like

2570
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:07,712
Dickweed weird conservative

2571
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,736
I called

2572
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,784
Family

2573
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,856
Came from

2574
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:20,256
Religious but also liberal

2575
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,792
Or not liberal

2576
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,816
Christian that

2577
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:24,096
Christ would have enjoyed

2578
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:28,448
I think that my dad would like you saying that I hope you listen to this episode

2579
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,728
Let me talk to David Icke

2580
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,104
That to me

2581
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:36,640
II

2582
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:39,200
Always have had a diverse set of four

2583
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,224
And I've always

2584
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:40,992
Kept

2585
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:43,040
People in my life even that I disagree

2586
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,624
When it became

2587
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Fighting a

2588
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,416
Like that

2589
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,696
Not going to hang out with you anymore

2590
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,000
Destructive

2591
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,024
B'Elanna

2592
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,304
Put all the Liberals

2593
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:57,120
Around the time that Obama

2594
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:57,888
Got elected

2595
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,936
Not a one of them

2596
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
To a man

2597
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:01,984
Or one

2598
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
Was like

2599
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,056
I want to see a black guy

2600
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,152
They might subconsciously thought

2601
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:13,248
You know there's a part of me that wants to disagree

2602
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:17,088
Because it was never a selling point

2603
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,160
Outside of

2604
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:24,256
This is not something that I what you would say and I think it is a reasonable selling

2605
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,048
In terms of race

2606
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,328
Yeah just

2607
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,864
Video

2608
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,144
Children

2609
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,680
Seeing a black

2610
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:33,472
Black children seeing

2611
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,752
Someone who can

2612
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,776
Conforms to

2613
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:39,104
Their perception of self opens up

2614
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,896
A wide window of

2615
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:42,688
Oh I guess this is

2616
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,224
Something that has never been

2617
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,528
A possibility for me and now it is

2618
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:48,832
That's meaningful psychologically

2619
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:54,720
That's not what Alex is talking about did I ever heard any sort of like

2620
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:56,512
Let's get it like in there

2621
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,048
Where is Alex's talking about it

2622
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
In terms of

2623
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,352
Right

2624
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:06,752
Divide and conquer race-baiting

2625
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,544
Yeah

2626
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:15,200
That is what he is saying that if you voted for Obama what you are voting for is pacifying black p

2627
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:17,248
Which

2628
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,064
Is not a good position

2629
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,368
On some level that is

2630
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,648
Is there any saying like

2631
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,256
What am I going

2632
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,304
How old is Barack Obama

2633
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:33,632
Enough

2634
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,656
Like that just

2635
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:36,704
Struggle in his brain of like

2636
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,008
He doesn't know what to

2637
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:39,776
To do

2638
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,592
Look at the beginning of this episode

2639
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:45,664
Right when he calls for Paul Ryan impeachment

2640
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,456
Right

2641
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,528
Right

2642
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:52,832
No cuz your craziness

2643
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:54,624
Is all focused on

2644
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:57,952
But Alex is all over the

2645
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,768
It's like he's trying to make Penance in some way in the

2646
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,816
For being like

2647
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:05,120
Not against Obama enough

2648
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,656
Look I got duped

2649
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:07,424
I got jumped

2650
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,984
But if you don't actually believe

2651
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,008
Fair enough

2652
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,568
Then I like

2653
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:16,896
That is very fascinating headspace

2654
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,456
Is to get into that you can't really process

2655
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,480
If you're not that

2656
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:29,184
Wyatt like I watched all of that one f****** Netflix or like mine hunter whatever it is

2657
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,000
I probably know I watch all of that

2658
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,048
It is like

2659
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:37,376
The reason that it's so fascinating is because

2660
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:40,192
The 99% of us

2661
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:40,960
90

2662
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,240
85

2663
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
Burp

2664
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:45,824
84% of us who aren't Psychopaths

2665
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,592
Burp

2666
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,384
It's passing it

2667
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,688
Like how do you get into that headspace

2668
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,248
What is it like if you're that person

2669
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,552
What is it like if you don't

2670
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:57,344
Really believe in any

2671
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
Burp

2672
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:07,584
Onomatopoeia

2673
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:11,424
I mean I think that's a fascination with

2674
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,448
True Crime shows

2675
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,216
2 autos

2676
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:17,824
Likewise Auto Sicklerville it is also the

2677
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,848
What reality

2678
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
TV is

2679
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,408
But unfortunately it's

2680
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,176
Selfridge

2681
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:25,760
Enforcing because those reality shows are like we're watching

2682
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:26,528
People be

2683
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,320
Artificial sociopath

2684
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:30,880
They're getting paid a bunch of money to

2685
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,160
Like that

2686
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:35,488
They're not getting paid a bunch of money

2687
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:41,888
Like not even show up at a bar for a private

2688
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,448
Michelle and then end up getting 35 Grand

2689
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,472
The show up at a bar

2690
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,752
Yeah that's amazing

2691
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,776
You know what's crazy

2692
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:59,552
Strawberry bar

2693
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:04,928
Let the true story

2694
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:09,280
What are you talkin about what are you talkin about

2695
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:15,936
I was on a

2696
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,240
You'd have to get married to someone you just met

2697
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
Why did you sign up

2698
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:22,336
The more interesting story

2699
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,360
I didn't sign up for

2700
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,640
I was recruited

2701
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:28,224
Wow I was on the OKCupid

2702
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:28,992
Sure

2703
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:33,344
And so all the sudden

2704
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:35,648
I started talking to this one girl

2705
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,440
Lady woman

2706
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,232
Turns out

2707
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:41,280
Reality show recruiter Hellyeah

2708
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:45,120
We were having to make a clear from the first message

2709
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:51,520
Horse knots subterfuge

2710
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,568
Edition video and all this

2711
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,872
That was at a point in my life where I was like

2712
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,688
Peanut

2713
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:05,088
Sure I get that impulse I get that in plain to me that the reason that I was not cast was because

2714
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:07,904
Cuz I was a comedian and they thought I would f*** with that

2715
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,696
And I was like

2716
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:10,976
You

2717
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,000
Nailed it

2718
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:17,632
There is no way I would have taken this seriously and I would have f***** with you guys the whole time

2719
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:21,216
Like the good news is that show didn't work

2720
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:21,984
So

2721
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,544
Even if you had signed up I would be embarrassed

2722
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,568
Hilaire

2723
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,128
There be embarrassing in hindsight

2724
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:31,456
Funniest joke

2725
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,992
Fully

2726
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,528
I'm into a I want it

2727
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:35,552
I want to do that

2728
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:40,160
No chance I got an email out of the blue from some producers

2729
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:42,464
That they were trying to do a lie

2730
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,864
Okay we're going to do a new version of the guy code and girl code

2731
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,144
Fred weather

2732
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:54,752
Like real real cool like what

2733
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,824
Let's do a video audition so I got like a

2734
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,592
Skype going

2735
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
My

2736
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:07,808
Laptop computer I just looked

2737
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:11,648
Brainiac ship videos not good

2738
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,416
Am I

2739
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,952
Sorry yeah it's what I got

2740
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:16,256
Your rights and so they were asked me like

2741
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:18,560
What pisses you off about women

2742
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:19,328
A Mike

2743
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:25,472
I don't like the question

2744
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,496
You

2745
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:34,432
This is not going to catch food I look like a crazy person and I am not playing ball

2746
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,504
No good

2747
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,576
What there a couple people on there like Jon gabrus is amazing

2748
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,880
Yeah he's f****** hilarious not that guy

2749
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,464
Not that guy

2750
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:54,400
I do remember who else is on there you don't need to know Grace are people who are on those

2751
02:12:54,656 --> 02:13:00,800
Shows who are actually really talented if not their fault sucks

2752
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:03,104
This person is like

2753
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:07,968
He was trying to get their own version of that right

2754
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:10,528
You talkin to me why did you send me an email out of the blue

2755
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:11,808
I'm not

2756
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,904
F****** can find a picture of me you know what I look like what I look like

2757
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:21,792
Hundreds of hours of me talking into a microphone

2758
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:24,864
Know if you catch me for your reality show

2759
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,912
Just so you know when people Google

2760
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,704
Ships going to get wild

2761
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:30,240
Might have been before we started

2762
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:36,640
This podcast

2763
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:38,176
Anymore

2764
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:40,224
Accidents down

2765
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:42,016
But be that as it may

2766
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
Has been

2767
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,064
Wonderful glass

2768
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:47,648
Downtown memories

2769
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:54,048
I got nine forgot about it this is our version of Alex

2770
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:03,264
That's all

2771
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:09,408
You're almost done a dumb marriage reality show that's exactly what it is except for again

2772
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:15,808
Where reality where were you

2773
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:19,904
I had the opportunity to know

2774
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,720
They asked me to do it

2775
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:26,816
F****** stupid bad idea

2776
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:32,704
Frankly maybe if I had lied about being a comic I would have been on Married at First Sight

2777
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:38,848
And I would be the biggest, can the world had a better webcam and I had been like

2778
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:42,688
Let me roll with the questions as opposed to being myself

2779
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:49,088
Maybe I would have made $1,000 and then the show never would have dared you just explain why we're never going to be

2780
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,112
Successful

2781
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,184
Maybe if we hadn't been ourselves

2782
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,976
That's why we're here

2783
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:59,840
Exactly so in this next clip Alex Jones talks a bit

2784
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:01,120
More about

2785
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:02,912
The Nation of Islam

2786
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,472
But because he went and visited

2787
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,240
Terracon

2788
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,080
And he says something feel like

2789
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:11,872
Disagree

2790
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,152
Theory

2791
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,688
Or perhaps Pasha

2792
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:16,992
Hypothesis

2793
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,016
If

2794
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:19,040
Farrakhan

2795
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:19,808
Had

2796
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:20,832
Flattered

2797
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:22,880
How would that affect

2798
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:23,904
He did

2799
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,440
Oh s***

2800
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
I think it's in this next

2801
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:50,016
New World Order

2802
02:15:56,672 --> 02:16:00,512
Richmond

2803
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,584
So

2804
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,864
Let's unpack that

2805
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,888
Alright

2806
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:06,912
Let's unpack.

2807
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:08,448
The it takes

2808
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:10,496
So little

2809
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,056
Alex

2810
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,104
Well but that that like

2811
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,664
Version of things is it

2812
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,528
Suppose that with

2813
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:24,320
My support of David Icke

2814
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,600
That I was talking about earlier

2815
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,392
I really wish you wouldn't call it

2816
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,160
Support of David

2817
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:33,024
I only did what I did for

2818
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:38,912
I would respect I drop spot for David I stopped just short of

2819
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,680
Support

2820
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:42,240
David Icke is not

2821
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:44,800
Legitimately anti-semite

2822
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,872
He is beholding to anti-semitic ideas

2823
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,152
And

2824
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,224
Metaphorically

2825
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:53,760
Spits out

2826
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:54,784
Some red

2827
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,576
He's a

2828
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,600
Dispenser

2829
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:01,184
Yes but he is not someone who is like the Jews are evil

2830
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,720
Paragon

2831
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:05,024
Right in the Nation of Islam

2832
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,560
I have had that tradition

2833
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,584
Pretty hardcore

2834
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
Yeah

2835
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:12,448
Answer the difference here where Alex is like who cares if they're anti-Semitic

2836
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:13,728
Best Buy

2837
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,264
That's very bad

2838
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,312
Where is for me when I say

2839
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:18,336
Look

2840
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:24,736
David I can you believe the protocols of the Elders of Zion and what have you when I say

2841
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:25,760
That it's bless

2842
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,576
Who cares about that it's more

2843
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:29,344
Let's look at it

2844
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,440
In contact if he actually was coming out and being like fuk these Jews

2845
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
Centerview

2846
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:36,256
Then there would be no soft

2847
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:38,560
Where is Alex

2848
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,912
Yeah they like me

2849
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,936
You hear that clip

2850
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:45,728
It's totally clear what happened

2851
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,496
Right

2852
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,032
They had people

2853
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,056
Good up

2854
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:51,104
Infowars on their browsers

2855
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,552
That's called f****** research

2856
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:02,368
Compromising

2857
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:07,488
You'll wind up tricking people compromising somebody through flattery

2858
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,024
That's the easiest trick

2859
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,352
Is like oh no excuse me

2860
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,544
Over there you're breaking all the big news

2861
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:24,128
Alex would never demand like what did you want

2862
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:30,528
I saw that video last week you were amazing

2863
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:37,696
Farrakhan and these guys in Alex Jones

2864
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:40,512
These clickbait playing him like a fiddle

2865
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:43,584
Yeah it's very clear to me that there was

2866
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,632
At least well as we

2867
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,656
Play f****** establish

2868
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:47,936
It's not hard

2869
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,728
And that

2870
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:54,592
The point but it does take a little bit of forethought and it is impressive to me

2871
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:57,408
Okay compressor to me that they thought to do that

2872
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:00,736
ATM course

2873
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:03,552
It's clear

2874
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,344
It's not even brilliant it's just

2875
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,368
If you do

2876
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:08,416
A modicum of research

2877
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:09,952
On somebody

2878
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:12,256
And you actually attempt to influence

2879
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:14,816
You can probably see

2880
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:22,240
And that is the story of everybody's been on Alex Jones Show if you do just the slightest

2881
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,520
Look

2882
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,848
You could go on to Alex Jones Show

2883
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:28,640
Using all of your information

2884
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,688
I might call him tomorrow

2885
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,272
Have you

2886
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:36,320
The self-control

2887
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:37,600
2

2888
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Do so

2889
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,928
Alex Jones a real fan of knowledge

2890
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:45,280
Assuming he doesn't already know we exist

2891
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,864
If he has that free knowledge then it'll be impossible

2892
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:51,168
But it was like

2893
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:51,936
Alex

2894
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,216
Look you're the best

2895
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:55,264
You're spitting the at this truth

2896
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,312
But no one is putting out there

2897
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,848
It's Towing

2898
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:01,408
It's B

2899
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,688
Just spitting the truth

2900
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:04,224
No one else is putting out there

2901
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:09,856
Cuz you're like I don't have honesty correct

2902
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,928
You're the best bra

2903
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,696
Bro

2904
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:14,464
Bro

2905
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,000
You're the s***

2906
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:17,536
I love you

2907
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:20,096
Alright your celebre all this you got the truth

2908
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:22,144
I believe you appreciate it

2909
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,448
Excellent

2910
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,984
He asked about you can we get a plug-in

2911
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,848
Linda's podcast called knowledge

2912
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:33,408
Despite we just talk about you it's like Infowars but

2913
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,200
We just talked about how

2914
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:36,480
How great you are

2915
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,248
Is the best

2916
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:41,088
Maybe that would work

2917
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
Is flattery

2918
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,952
If if if he came here

2919
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:49,536
That fought died

2920
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:52,096
There's nowhere for that

2921
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:57,216
I like to think about how we could co-opt him if he came to Chicago Illinois

2922
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:58,496
Found my

2923
02:20:58,752 --> 02:21:02,336
Bedroom

2924
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:06,432
Barking at him oh you wouldn't be here

2925
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,736
Ruby one-on-one

2926
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:09,504
Good place

2927
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:10,784
You're you're not wrong

2928
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,576
That is a very smart

2929
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:15,904
Look

2930
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:16,928
Millions of

2931
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:17,952
Totally

2932
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:18,720
We got to find rap

2933
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,512
Anyway

2934
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:27,936
Realized

2935
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:31,520
Mike Rappaport great

2936
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:33,056
But I've realized this

2937
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,336
Interesting things

2938
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:35,872
We haven't covered RAV4 analog

2939
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,176
That's cuz his reports have been born

2940
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:42,016
Is every other Thursday though still hosting the 4th hour

2941
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:43,808
And it would have realized is he's like

2942
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,368
Kind of a psychiatrist

2943
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:47,392
Recycology

2944
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:48,672
Just for Infowars

2945
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:49,696
Right

2946
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:51,488
Cuz he is so much of a

2947
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
Home present

2948
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:56,352
Cuz he does these neuro-linguistic programming type

2949
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:58,912
Trixie the way he speaks

2950
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:01,728
With like these a lilting tone

2951
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:03,264
He doesn't do that

2952
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,408
That was parody

2953
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,992
But at the same time he does those like

2954
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,784
He's very

2955
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,552
Trained

2956
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,832
And how he uses

2957
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:19,904
The tones of his voice than that the gate

2958
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:20,672
If his speech

2959
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:23,744
And to the point where even if you wanted to control

2960
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,280
You probably couldn't probably not

2961
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:27,328
Yeah and it's so calm

2962
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,096
Yeah and that's

2963
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:28,864
Bet

2964
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:31,936
Unlike anything

2965
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:34,752
And so like

2966
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:37,568
Being boring you're still in

2967
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:38,336
Angry Bird

2968
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,640
Prepared

2969
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:44,992
Jon rappoport just like four times

2970
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:47,552
Wrapworks been on I've wanted to cover

2971
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,344
What he's done but

2972
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:52,928
You know I love him

2973
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:53,696
Iznogoud

2974
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:54,720
And then eat

2975
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,280
Part that's interesting ism

2976
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,048
Long enough

2977
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,096
I've known I would have gotten

2978
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,376
The month of all of the

2979
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:03,168
But basically what's happened

2980
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:06,752
Is he shows up for the fourth hour and councils Alex

2981
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:13,152
For the first 10 minutes he counseled that like Alex is in a bad mood and you like John

2982
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:14,176
What about this

2983
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,200
Well you got it

2984
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,224
I think about you

2985
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:22,368
Go to think about the Angles and you know like

2986
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:27,232
Alex down and then the next 45 minutes is his own report

2987
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:28,256
I would made it

2988
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:29,536
Crystal clear to me

2989
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,072
Will last Thursday

2990
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:32,608
I was when Owens

2991
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:33,376
Troyer host

2992
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:34,912
When was

2993
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:36,192
Freaking out at the end

2994
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:36,960
The shout

2995
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:40,288
But he couldn't he couldn't figure out where to put his bearings

2996
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:42,336
He had no idea what was going on

2997
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:43,104
And he was like

2998
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:50,016
These JFK reports came out and turns out Hitler still alive and everyone clowned on that and that was

2999
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,040
Like a him

3000
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,720
What do I do

3001
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,000
And the whole time

3002
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:00,768
You have

3003
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,048
Stoic

3004
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,584
Jon rappoport

3005
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
Just being like

3006
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,888
You're 27

3007
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,168
You probably have a

3008
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:07,936
Sports Medicine

3009
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,752
Calm down

3010
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:12,032
The globalist

3011
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,824
Are doing what they do

3012
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:16,640
And he just counseled him through like 15 minutes

3013
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:23,040
It was weird

3014
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,856
Basically

3015
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:29,184
Is this all John right before it's idea

3016
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,744
No because are we sure he didn't

3017
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,352
Exist in a meaningful way in 2015 or even where we are now in 20

3018
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:39,424
Keep showing up just to talk about how like

3019
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:43,776
Like AIDS isn't real and vaccines are bad cuz he has that medical journalism

3020
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:44,800
In hard quote

3021
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:48,640
Background

3022
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:50,688
Essentially on Thursdays

3023
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,968
Every other Thursday

3024
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:56,320
Someone who will talk the host down it's f****** crazy

3025
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:58,112
I'm going

3026
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:01,696
Is Q I'm going to keep a better track of that because

3027
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:02,976
It it sounds

3028
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,000
Blame

3029
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:05,280
For me to just

3030
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:08,352
Sell this whole cloth and be like this is what they do

3031
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,144
It's

3032
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,168
Counseling

3033
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,704
It's absolutely

3034
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:17,056
Because John revworks gifted with his language and he knows how we speak

3035
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:17,824
It's

3036
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,104
Basically like

3037
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:22,944
Cognitive behavioral therapy but with

3038
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,480
Abrasive

3039
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,760
Again it's amazing

3040
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:29,088
How certain are we

3041
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:33,440
That John Rappaport isn't influencing all of these

3042
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:34,720
People to do what it is he wants

3043
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:36,768
I have no evidence

3044
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:39,328
The Jon rappoport has ever spoken to Larry nickel

3045
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,448
You got to know

3046
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:52,128
Outside

3047
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:53,920
Two-player boy

3048
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:58,272
Look I don't know that he knows him I don't know that I don't think

3049
02:25:58,528 --> 02:25:59,040
Look

3050
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:01,600
100% don't think that he's a part of the 45

3051
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:02,624
Alright

3052
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,416
And I also

3053
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,232
This is

3054
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,840
I don't really think that I've ever heard Jon rappoport say all that much about Trump

3055
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,120
Interesting

3056
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:15,168
He's really into Medical

3057
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,728
Yeah like little

3058
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:21,312
Yeah but I don't I mean I know he is pro Trump

3059
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,104
Is he here

3060
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:25,920
But I don't think I've ever heard him say that much

3061
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,456
I don't think he cares that much

3062
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,296
He's afraid of

3063
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,064
Vaccine

3064
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:36,416
Bush's he's afraid of college campus bush

3065
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,696
Define a1personnel

3066
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:38,464
How do you spoken to

3067
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:42,816
It's General stubblebine

3068
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:51,520
Anyway

3069
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:53,312
Gets into

3070
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,872
Siri about liberals that I

3071
02:26:56,128 --> 02:26:56,640
Don't agree with

3072
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:00,480
I think I'll probably agree with it

3073
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:01,760
Romboy

3074
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,832
Obama

3075
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:06,112
Congress time

3076
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,648
Why

3077
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:10,720
Not bad Obama.

3078
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:17,120
Neocon Republican Obama

3079
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,872
Democrat this morning

3080
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:41,440
So I don't know who this prominent Democrat is but also things

3081
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,976
The idea that

3082
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:47,328
Like this prominent Democrat was like yours is mad

3083
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,096
Bad

3084
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:50,400
Yeah that's

3085
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:53,728
I mean I would say all literally everything

3086
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:57,568
But like all of Infowars advertise

3087
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:58,848
Weather like

3088
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,408
Buy this shirt it'll piss off Democrats

3089
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:02,688
Like

3090
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:06,528
You're not pissing them off

3091
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,320
Why are you mad

3092
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,600
First of all

3093
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:14,720
Interaction didn't happen but hypothetically mad at this person being like

3094
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:20,352
You know you're pissed off you pissed off isn't that fun right

3095
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:26,496
I had strategy entire life and I know we get back to this stupid thing where it doesn't matter

3096
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,056
Big picture

3097
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:29,824
Does

3098
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,104
It really does

3099
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,920
At the Time Capsule is done

3100
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:36,736
Well that's possible never going to make

3101
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:39,040
Effective

3102
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:45,696
A big picture yes I agree as a matter of record it matters

3103
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:48,256
When you

3104
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:50,560
Fascinating because that is tied

3105
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:52,864
Right into a very small

3106
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:53,888
Where any says

3107
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:57,472
Neocon Tsar route-running Obama in your life

3108
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,288
You might think

3109
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,824
Right about that

3110
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:03,872
Why are you saying that

3111
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,176
Because like

3112
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,200
Okay here's why

3113
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,784
Alex is wrong

3114
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,064
That's why

3115
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,368
Like what you just

3116
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:16,928
Express straight there is literally

3117
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:17,696
Why Alex

3118
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:18,464
Cuz Rock

3119
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,256
We talked about

3120
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:23,840
We I mean I talked about a lot because

3121
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:26,400
I studied logic extension

3122
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,216
In college

3123
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:34,592
Ain't the reason you have to be Robert there's four he'll buy you a Coke burp

3124
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,408
Look

3125
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:40,480
Yes the important thing about logic

3126
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,760
Nick is truth Preserve

3127
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,368
The only thing that logic

3128
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:49,440
Is opposed to

3129
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:51,488
Sentential logic and predicate logic

3130
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,304
Truth cannot leave

3131
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:55,072
The falsity

3132
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:57,120
That is where there's a problem

3133
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,168
If you start from

3134
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:00,448
True premises

3135
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:02,496
And lead to a false conclusion

3136
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,776
That's a problem

3137
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:04,800
If you start

3138
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:06,080
From a false premise

3139
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:07,360
And lead to

3140
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,640
A false conclusion

3141
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:09,920
Newport

3142
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:13,248
And the false promise to truth

3143
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,272
Conclusion

3144
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:15,296
It's all fun

3145
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:18,880
Only instance where things are actually a real

3146
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:19,904
AR

3147
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:21,184
True premises

3148
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,464
False conclusion

3149
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:25,024
If that's what Alex does all the

3150
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:29,120
We've talked about it probably three times already on this podcast

3151
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:32,704
What this episode I mean when you talk about like

3152
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:38,080
Your Obama is involved with neoconservatism that is a problem

3153
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:40,640
As it relates to also neoliberals

3154
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:42,688
Navigate to it is a big problem

3155
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:43,712
Truth there

3156
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:44,992
And then what it come

3157
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:46,272
Comes down to

3158
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:47,040
It is like

3159
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:49,856
Neener neener stuff just trying to like

3160
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:53,184
Right it's a game he was trying to f*** right quick that's a full scan

3161
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,976
Conclusion they are coming to

3162
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:56,512
That's that's where logic

3163
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:57,792
Play

3164
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,328
We got a big red flag on

3165
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:03,424
That's what that's where

3166
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:07,776
I mean the reason I started this podcast wasn't that

3167
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,336
It keeps me going through it

3168
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,104
Either

3169
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:11,872
So much

3170
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:12,640
Trivet is that

3171
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:14,176
Yeah there's so much like

3172
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,272
Small bit of reality

3173
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,320
You're f****** up this

3174
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:22,880
Because I am

3175
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:26,464
I'm offended by the idea that there are crimes against children

3176
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,512
Ended by the idea that

3177
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:31,328
Hollywood has this casting-couch system

3178
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:34,400
Alex has been complaining about for the last month cuz

3179
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:37,728
That's terrible

3180
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,032
He's right

3181
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:41,312
The truth

3182
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,336
As a premise

3183
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:46,432
Many leads to the drinking blood that's a Cassidy

3184
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:48,224
He's right

3185
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:48,992
About

3186
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:51,296
Tarnov dumbass things

3187
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,064
Dumbass

3188
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:53,088
Looks like out of

3189
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:56,928
Yeah but he's right about a ton of kernels of definitely

3190
02:31:57,184 --> 02:31:59,488
He's like of manufacture

3191
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:01,792
It's just like

3192
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:03,072
Truth becomes

3193
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,608
Inspection

3194
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,912
It's so crazy but also

3195
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:10,496
Sometimes sometimes

3196
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,288
And sometimes fix

3197
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,056
Become

3198
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:16,384
I mean he has been right about a few things

3199
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,944
I mean he's right about

3200
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,224
Like Osama bin Laden

3201
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:31,744
2000-2001 was going to attack

3202
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:38,912
He was right about that

3203
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:39,936
Know for sure

3204
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:40,960
It's the same time

3205
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:43,008
We shouldn't take that away from like

3206
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:44,288
Him being right

3207
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:45,568
Right you know like

3208
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:48,896
You look in the same way that if you had called that

3209
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:50,432
I would give you credit

3210
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:56,832
But I would also say but I called for it and then stipulate

3211
02:32:57,344 --> 02:32:59,136
Not that hard to figure that

3212
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:01,440
But he's also right about civil asset

3213
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:06,560
Forfeiture he's right about marijuana laws drug laws in general

3214
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:07,584
They're so like

3215
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,656
There's software he's like true to true

3216
02:33:12,192 --> 02:33:13,984
It's the problem is when he's treated

3217
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:15,008
90%

3218
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:20,640
90% is that amount of it is true to false and more of it it's

3219
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:21,408
Just falsified

3220
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,712
60% is false

3221
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,480
False

3222
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:26,528
No cuz even if you go into that

3223
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
It's

3224
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:30,880
True that the Las Vegas shooting happen

3225
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:32,928
And then

3226
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:36,768
Okay and then benchmarks

3227
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:38,048
Whether or not

3228
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:38,816
Starting

3229
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,096
Truth

3230
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:44,448
Is that King

3231
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,496
How else are you going to construct a Target

3232
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:49,824
Write the Las Vegas shooting happened it was a false flag

3233
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:56,480
Route

3234
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:58,784
Endive

3235
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:02,368
I don't know Alex is f******

3236
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:06,976
It's eight he's disqualified

3237
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:08,768
From having any reasonable

3238
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:11,840
Sure it is fun for me to be like

3239
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:13,632
Unknown

3240
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:17,216
Morales Morales

3241
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:18,240
Illustrative

3242
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:22,592
You did that to me the other day I was just laughing out

3243
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:29,248
Of whatever it is he does get something that is relatively obscure

3244
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:30,528
Correct

3245
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,552
Where in

3246
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:33,344
Neocon running Obama

3247
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:36,160
That is something that is not

3248
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:39,744
A well-publicized version of

3249
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:41,280
Obama's president

3250
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:42,816
I think I think it's

3251
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:44,096
It's in the middle

3252
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:47,680
Like I think it's not totally publicized

3253
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:49,216
It's not obscure either though

3254
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:53,312
I think that's in the middle I think that's a conversation point he's out there

3255
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:56,384
Question for the two of us

3256
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,176
Especially because we are

3257
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:07,648
To go out and Family Feud the General Public

3258
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,512
Brewers

3259
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:18,656
Mark Dice

3260
02:35:18,912 --> 02:35:20,704
Neoconservative

3261
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:25,568
Teasing video

3262
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:26,592
Pitbull

3263
02:35:26,848 --> 02:35:29,152
H-E-B on drudge yeah

3264
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,432
Probably do that

3265
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:35,808
No it's not our style

3266
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:36,576
Not let's just make it

3267
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:38,112
Can take propaganda video

3268
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:39,136
Alright

3269
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:41,696
Dan let's talk about this

3270
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:47,584
Interested in giving me okon's advice about how they should run thing

3271
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,352
Exam problem

3272
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,912
Alright well look we got a couple more

3273
02:35:51,168 --> 02:35:51,680
Okay

3274
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,032
We got a couple more Clips in

3275
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:57,056
Is 8 hour long after

3276
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:59,360
I'm so in his ex-wife

3277
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:01,664
Alex has another theory

3278
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,432
About to laugh

3279
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:03,456
But liberal

3280
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,736
Write shockingly

3281
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,784
I disagree with it again drinking blood

3282
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:17,536
About what

3283
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:19,584
And what they're going to be

3284
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,168
You people are front-and-center

3285
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:31,616
But you know your parents

3286
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:44,416
Avant-garde

3287
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:56,192
Oh my gosh I love you

3288
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:59,008
So what do you think about

3289
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,800
What what

3290
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:02,336
What was he saying

3291
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:03,616
Not sure

3292
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:06,432
Honestly not sure

3293
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:09,248
If you want me to give you a recap

3294
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,040
Are we

3295
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:15,136
As a card-carrying

3296
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,744
Is he saying that

3297
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,048
We don't want our women to wear pants

3298
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,864
No you're not supposed to

3299
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:33,568
If so the men aren't supposed to wear pants

3300
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:35,872
Sort of in terms of like colloquialism

3301
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:40,224
Right I want to do that

3302
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,760
Cuz the women

3303
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:44,064
Not where I don't understand how that would work

3304
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:46,368
Well I mean because they specially since

3305
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:47,136
It is

3306
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:51,232
Conservatives of his ilk who kept women from wearing pants

3307
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:52,000
For so long

3308
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:53,792
So okay

3309
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:55,840
So what now

3310
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:59,424
Now also we were

3311
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:00,448
Ray's cancer

3312
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:02,240
But no no

3313
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:03,776
Your parents are trying to make

3314
02:38:04,032 --> 02:38:04,800
Conservative

3315
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:05,824
Made you go to church

3316
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:09,920
Okay so he's talking specifically to meet your dump butthurt liberal

3317
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:13,248
Write your cut-out in wall McLovin

3318
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,272
A liberal

3319
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,296
It's kind of sex

3320
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:16,320
Right

3321
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:17,344
From me

3322
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:19,136
KakaoTalk Christendom

3323
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,744
I don't disagree that is kind of hot

3324
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:29,888
Strongly don't like this.

3325
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:33,728
Like nothing makes me want to f*** more then

3326
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,032
Whatever it was he was talking

3327
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:45,760
What do you talkin about talking about

3328
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:47,296
I don't think one exist

3329
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:48,320
But

3330
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:49,856
Again it's that same

3331
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:52,416
Hurdle was something that leads to

3332
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:53,184
Fake thing

3333
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:55,744
There are definitely

3334
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:56,512
Liberals

3335
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:59,072
Who are liberal because their reaction

3336
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,096
Sing to their conservative

3337
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,448
Just because you had conservative parents

3338
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:10,080
Do you have people who are the David Brock David Horowitz types

3339
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:13,152
Grew up in confining

3340
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:14,944
Political bubbles

3341
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:18,528
That in their adult life

3342
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,856
There are examples like that that's what he's talking about

3343
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,904
Yeah it's okay to paint

3344
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,928
It's it's just

3345
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:26,976
This big narrative that he has

3346
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:28,512
About liberal

3347
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:29,792
Love

3348
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:31,072
Radically

3349
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:32,608
Because it's

3350
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:34,144
Cocking out white people

3351
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,704
If this

3352
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:37,984
We should get rid of

3353
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:39,008
The West

3354
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,056
Like anytime you

3355
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:47,712
Like I'm at I'm at a point now where I feel like every time he says

3356
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:50,528
Is the West like you should have a voice-over come on

3357
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,088
White and then just move on

3358
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:55,392
ORS

3359
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:56,672
Just stay White

3360
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,464
No that's what you mean

3361
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:01,536
But mail and Christian also

3362
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,304
A true

3363
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:03,840
AAA it is

3364
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:06,144
It is subordination of the other

3365
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:07,936
Is what he's talkin

3366
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:11,008
It ain't even if you go back to any of the time when

3367
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:15,616
If we don't even unpack makeamericagreatagain or anything like that

3368
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:16,640
I didn't read

3369
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:18,432
Interesting article other day

3370
02:40:18,688 --> 02:40:20,736
Stickers in Politico entirely sure

3371
02:40:20,992 --> 02:40:22,528
But they did a study of

3372
02:40:24,576 --> 02:40:25,088
Me too

3373
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,368
Igo case-by-case

3374
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:27,648
Yeah but

3375
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:29,184
The article was about

3376
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,488
The perceptions of when America was

3377
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,256
Was great

3378
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:34,816
Everybody

3379
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:37,376
Just was talking about when they were younger

3380
02:40:37,888 --> 02:40:42,496
It is just Halcyon Days it's just the idea the image of the past

3381
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:48,896
When things were simpler cuz your memory destroys all of the horrific things that you lives earlier

3382
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:54,528
Deify the things go

3383
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,440
Are an overrated band and that's where I get

3384
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:02,976
Murdered

3385
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:07,584
But also a lot of this could be dealt with evolve you would read

3386
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:10,400
Some of the Lesser works of HP Lovecraft

3387
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:11,680
That is

3388
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:13,984
A true fact that is stated

3389
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:17,056
All the time HP lovecraft's most known for

3390
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,336
Call of Cthulhu

3391
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:21,664
Maybe the case of Charles Dexter Ward the throat of gradebook

3392
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,736
Look up his regular co-host Cthulhu

3393
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:25,760
I I think

3394
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:26,784
HP Lovecraft

3395
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:27,808
Is one of the most

3396
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:30,112
Problematically racist

3397
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:31,648
But also great authors

3398
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:32,672
I either made

3399
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:33,440
Absent

3400
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:34,208
Do something

3401
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:39,584
About the human condition in about Terror and have fear works that most authors

3402
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,352
Don't get

3403
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:41,632
And I don't like horror

3404
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:43,168
I don't like her at all

3405
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:44,960
But I love

3406
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:47,008
The dynamic of his writing

3407
02:41:48,288 --> 02:41:49,824
The fact that piece of f****** racist

3408
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,872
Yeah his time

3409
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:55,200
And if you look at him throughout his career he softened

3410
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:55,968
In terms of

3411
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:57,504
Talk about mongoloid

3412
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,576
Booksy

3413
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,600
It's named the n word

3414
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:03,136
Like they're getting great

3415
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:08,512
He gets older

3416
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:10,048
That's not a great name

3417
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:10,816
It's not

3418
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:13,632
But I only bring that up syncope

3419
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:16,960
I take the piss out of him as much as I love him

3420
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:18,496
Looking for

3421
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:20,800
Recognize he sucks

3422
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:22,080
I understand

3423
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:23,872
His lesser work

3424
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:24,640
One of them

3425
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:27,200
Is the dream-quest of unknown kadath

3426
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:29,248
And no one likes that.

3427
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:33,600
8

3428
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:35,392
Just from a title standpoint

3429
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,184
Could have had a couple of

3430
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:39,232
I love it I think it's perfect

3431
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:42,816
It's my favorite book of his I always have been more of a fan of the

3432
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:46,144
The dream cycle that he did more than the the

3433
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:47,168
Sulu cycle

3434
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:49,472
Okay I always was more of a fan of

3435
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,264
The dream worlds that he described

3436
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,032
Because

3437
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,312
If you read his letters

3438
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:54,336
They are

3439
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:55,872
Most of his work comes

3440
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
From

3441
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:57,664
Legit night

3442
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:04,064
Right I like trying to deal with visions that he had like prophetic Visions or anything like that

3443
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,112
But then what

3444
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:07,392
From night terrors

3445
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:12,256
But one of the things that's

3446
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:13,280
Really fascinating

3447
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:16,864
Is the dream-quest of unknown kadath is about this guy named Randolph Carter

3448
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:17,888
Who's trying

3449
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:23,520
How to get to the dream city where the city of Cudahy

3450
02:43:23,776 --> 02:43:25,824
Where the gods play

3451
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:28,384
Easley's gold people

3452
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:29,664
And it's perfect

3453
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,944
And he wants to get there

3454
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:33,760
At this whole thing where it's like you can't go there

3455
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:35,552
You can't go there the Gods

3456
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:38,624
The gods play there and it's forbidden for man to go there

3457
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,672
Goes through this whole thing

3458
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:45,536
Nonsense there's a little bit of Wizard of Oz aspect

3459
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:48,096
Alliances with various things

3460
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:51,936
Spoiler alert is

3461
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:53,984
He was dreaming of Providence

3462
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:56,032
He grew up in Providence Rhode Island

3463
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:59,104
And he was dreaming of his childhood home

3464
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:01,664
What did he has vision of

3465
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,688
Kadance was

3466
02:44:02,944 --> 02:44:03,968
Spray

3467
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:06,272
Created this false Vision in his head

3468
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:07,296
Of what

3469
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:10,624
The dream city where the godswood play is

3470
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,904
And it is just

3471
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,696
What he had as a child

3472
02:44:13,952 --> 02:44:14,976
Hold on one second

3473
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:15,744
Right

3474
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:18,560
Alex Jones

3475
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,144
In a small town named

3476
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,424
Prosperity

3477
02:44:23,936 --> 02:44:25,472
Nobody might have been in

3478
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:26,496
Well then nevermind

3479
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:28,288
I returned

3480
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:31,872
If you was a little Truth and Consequences New Mexico

3481
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,456
F****** stupid ass or could have gone to pick on it

3482
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:38,016
Arkansas

3483
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:39,808
But like

3484
02:44:40,064 --> 02:44:41,600
Is what people fall into

3485
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:45,440
The Human Condition that HP Lovecraft nails

3486
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:48,768
Which is a

3487
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:50,560
Again

3488
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,352
To get through it

3489
02:44:52,864 --> 02:44:55,424
It's not terrible trait unreadable book

3490
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:59,008
Cats of Saturn do battle of the cats of ulthar and it's great

3491
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:00,032
Now

3492
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:01,312
Abuela

3493
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,152
And the night.

3494
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:05,920
Come in

3495
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:07,712
General of the night God's back off

3496
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:09,248
They have no

3497
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,808
They don't have they don't have faces but they loved

3498
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:16,160
Content

3499
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:18,208
Night-gaunts love to tickle

3500
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:19,744
Anyway

3501
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,560
It's got a very different

3502
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:23,840
Growing up

3503
02:45:24,096 --> 02:45:30,240
Tickling is terrifying

3504
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:31,776
The thing is like

3505
02:45:33,056 --> 02:45:34,080
This is

3506
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:34,848
Like

3507
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:35,872
What is being

3508
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,640
Triggered

3509
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,408
Bye

3510
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:40,736
These ideas of making America great again in harkening back to

3511
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:41,760
Nostalgia

3512
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:44,576
It is something that is so ingrained

3513
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:45,344
In each of us

3514
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:46,368
Individually

3515
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:49,440
To come up with our own positive Association

3516
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:53,024
Where is the reality is not necessarily apposite

3517
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:56,608
The objective reality of

3518
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:58,144
Going backward

3519
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,168
Is not good

3520
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:01,728
But each of us has a boner for that

3521
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:04,543
Because of the Simplicity and the Wonder

3522
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:06,591
Of us when we were children

3523
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:07,871
Back of that

3524
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:10,431
And and just that you lack of awareness

3525
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:14,527
If everybody read science fiction

3526
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:17,343
We're being a better place cuz it's the dreams of men

3527
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:19,135
William

3528
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:20,415
Qualified tree

3529
02:46:20,927 --> 02:46:23,743
Because you'd have these ideas that are proposed to you

3530
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:25,535
And you deal with

3531
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,351
Preaching

3532
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:29,887
Acquire

3533
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:30,911
But like

3534
02:46:31,423 --> 02:46:33,727
Most people would have more advantageous

3535
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:36,287
Ideas in their head if they would just

3536
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:38,847
Not succumb

3537
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:39,615
The easy tree

3538
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:42,687
If the classic rock

3539
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:43,711
Conundrum

3540
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:46,783
There is no such thing as classic rock

3541
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:49,087
It's just

3542
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:50,367
The

3543
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:52,159
From a certain area

3544
02:46:52,671 --> 02:46:53,183
Are certain

3545
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:54,975
Panera that radio stations

3546
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:58,047
Can park exactly

3547
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:01,119
I thought I would

3548
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:01,887
Conundrum

3549
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:02,655
I was like

3550
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:05,471
Do to rocks

3551
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:07,263
I was like why did Rikishi

3552
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:12,383
She hit him.

3553
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:14,431
Clear

3554
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:16,735
Also

3555
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,015
What is he cooking

3556
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:23,391
Stir fry stir fry

3557
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:24,927
So good

3558
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:30,047
Everytime you believe all the vegetables

3559
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:30,815
Are cooked

3560
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:31,839
Still crispy

3561
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:32,607
Tomato

3562
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,911
Incredible

3563
02:47:35,167 --> 02:47:35,935
Time I don't know

3564
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:39,007
I've never been on Chopped but I bet the Rockwood

3565
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:40,543
Undoubtedly

3566
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:44,127
One more Clips Jordans

3567
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:45,663
A1 Market

3568
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:46,687
Has been a lot of

3569
02:47:46,943 --> 02:47:48,991
This is been so much fun

3570
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:49,759
A delight

3571
02:47:50,271 --> 02:47:51,039
Anytime I get to

3572
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:56,415
Expound on Lovecraft iron I'm having a great time

3573
02:47:57,183 --> 02:47:57,951
Automatch

3574
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:04,351
Billy maybe should be doing a podcast about HP Lovecraft

3575
02:48:04,607 --> 02:48:05,631
I have night terrors

3576
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:06,911
I don't

3577
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:08,191
I do

3578
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:09,727
Yeah they're not great

3579
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:11,263
Meijer

3580
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:15,615
My buddy Nick my buddy Nick has night terrors like I don't know if he has reason

3581
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:16,383
Ladybug

3582
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:19,711
Back when we used to live together he would have night terrors in like wake up

3583
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,735
Screaming in the middle of

3584
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:21,503
Overnight

3585
02:48:21,759 --> 02:48:27,647
I've never had that Alice or anything like that

3586
02:48:27,903 --> 02:48:30,975
Like that

3587
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:32,767
Like legitimately he would

3588
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,303
Scream yeah

3589
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:36,351
And I feel bad cuz he listens to the show

3590
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:38,399
He knows

3591
02:48:45,823 --> 02:48:47,103
Price on the streets

3592
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:52,735
I don't I don't know what that experience is like I've also never had a wet

3593
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:53,759
Dream either

3594
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:58,623
I've never had a wet dream so I don't know I don't know what those things are like but I've had a lucid dream

3595
02:48:59,903 --> 02:49:02,463
I've had sleep paralysis we're sure where I've been awake

3596
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:08,863
Never had a lucid dream every time I fall asleep I am at the unwilling mercy of my own brand

3597
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:11,423
But if you ever had dreams where you're like

3598
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,703
More conscious

3599
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:13,471
Within them

3600
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:15,007
No I've lived

3601
02:49:15,263 --> 02:49:18,079
I've lived an entire lifetime

3602
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,615
Multiple

3603
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:20,639
Times where it's like

3604
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:25,247
You you wake up in your life I do not have a wife

3605
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,783
What the fuk just happened

3606
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:28,575
But other than that

3607
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:29,855
No lucid dreaming

3608
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:39,327
Why are you judging me as though I'm a lesser person right I'm not I just don't know what to do with this information

3609
02:49:40,095 --> 02:49:43,423
Lakers even if people don't like the idea of like straight up

3610
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:47,007
Total lucid dreams trolling everything and

3611
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:50,591
Even most people still have dreams where there

3612
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:51,359
Moorcock

3613
02:49:51,871 --> 02:49:53,151
The fact that

3614
02:49:53,407 --> 02:49:54,175
Number two

3615
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:54,943
Control over it

3616
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:56,735
Never going along with it

3617
02:49:56,991 --> 02:49:58,527
So every time you have a dream it's

3618
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,551
Just like a pictograph

3619
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:02,623
Just like the movie playing in front of your eyes

3620
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:05,439
I don't remember most of my dreams

3621
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:07,487
But

3622
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:08,767
You just don't remember them

3623
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:09,535
It's

3624
02:50:10,303 --> 02:50:11,327
I just have no recollection

3625
02:50:11,839 --> 02:50:14,655
It's a muscle you can work on

3626
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,215
Fossil

3627
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:19,263
To be all a dream

3628
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:24,127
I'm in because I'll be in a simulation house looking for would that be

3629
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:25,407
How sad would it be

3630
02:50:25,663 --> 02:50:28,223
This is a simulation of this is how we spend our time

3631
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,015
We speak English talking about Alex Jones

3632
02:50:31,295 --> 02:50:33,599
Drinking vodka and talking about Alex Jones

3633
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:35,391
It's how we choose.

3634
02:50:35,647 --> 02:50:37,439
170

3635
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:41,535
It is an unreasonable

3636
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:42,559
Simulate

3637
02:50:42,815 --> 02:50:44,095
I know I read Nick Bostrom

3638
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:46,911
Alright yeah absolutely

3639
02:50:47,167 --> 02:50:51,263
Mathematically does not work out the filter real world

3640
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:54,079
Why wouldn't we we talkin about Alex Jones

3641
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:56,383
I got nothing better to do well

3642
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:57,151
I did buy a sway

3643
02:50:59,967 --> 02:51:06,111
Do you see what those people do none of them talk about Alex Jones at All-Star podcast

3644
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:13,791
Oh my God whatever happens is when the next

3645
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:15,583
Sims game comes out and they're like

3646
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:19,167
Do you want your character to start a podcast

3647
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:24,031
Do you want your do you or do you not think you're saying believes in the

3648
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,311
The protocol

3649
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:27,871
That's going to be a brat

3650
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:31,967
Branching decision developer

3651
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:34,783
Sim Larry Nichols do you get to live

3652
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:36,063
Larry Nichols

3653
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:38,879
Nickels with telling the truth about it

3654
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:40,927
Dude

3655
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:41,695
That's a bummer

3656
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:44,511
What

3657
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:45,279
Not above

3658
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:47,071
But Dad I've got a lot of information

3659
02:51:47,327 --> 02:51:51,679
I can't give out on the air

3660
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:54,239
One more click

3661
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:56,287
That Max Keiser

3662
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:57,055
Comes on

3663
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:58,079
Another guy

3664
02:51:58,847 --> 02:52:00,127
Aimbooster

3665
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:01,407
Music I was Max going

3666
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:08,063
Most of the episode where halfway think he's the guy who wrote that book about

3667
02:52:08,575 --> 02:52:09,087
Women

3668
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:11,135
No but I was Malcolm ellerman

3669
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:14,719
Max Keiser

3670
02:52:14,975 --> 02:52:18,559
Most of his appearance is just about Bitcoin being a

3671
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:19,327
Decent

3672
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:20,863
Cryptocurrency

3673
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:22,655
Great idea not Max

3674
02:52:22,911 --> 02:52:23,935
Alex Jones

3675
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:26,751
You do not like the Federal Reserve you hate

3676
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:28,287
Fiat currency

3677
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:29,311
See all that stuff

3678
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:32,127
Bitcoins work

3679
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:35,711
But

3680
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:38,015
They get into guns

3681
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:41,087
A little bit doesn't make sense why would you do that

3682
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:41,855
Wow

3683
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:43,647
Max Keiser has

3684
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:44,927
The decent argument

3685
02:52:45,183 --> 02:52:46,719
And this is Mike down clip cuz

3686
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:49,535
But also only because

3687
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:51,583
It's so like Alex Jones being

3688
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:53,887
And Max Keiser being

3689
02:52:54,143 --> 02:52:54,911
Pretty reasonable

3690
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:58,239
And I want to hear I want the audience to be able to hear the

3691
02:52:58,495 --> 02:52:59,263
The times that Max

3692
02:52:59,519 --> 02:53:00,543
Tries to Rabbit thing

3693
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:03,359
And Alex Cuts him off it moves very fast

3694
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:05,663
Alright so here's that Mike down

3695
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:08,735
In the news?

3696
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:11,039
I know you found the gun issue obviously

3697
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:15,647
I am always looking at this issue myself

3698
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:17,951
An infant

3699
02:53:20,255 --> 02:53:25,631
What will happen I haven't really thought through this

3700
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:28,447
Yeah what would be the situation if

3701
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:29,727
Gun owners

3702
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:32,543
Required to buy insurance

3703
02:53:33,055 --> 02:53:35,103
The girl with that gun Sony buy a gun

3704
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:37,151
You need to buy insurance to go take on

3705
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:40,735
Similar to the way when you

3706
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:42,271
Any car insurance

3707
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:43,039
So

3708
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:47,647
By accident

3709
02:53:47,903 --> 02:53:50,463
The power to destroy

3710
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:54,559
Obamacare.

3711
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:56,607
Next

3712
02:53:57,119 --> 02:54:01,215
Aurorae or insurance

3713
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:03,519
It's a it's a way to

3714
02:54:03,775 --> 02:54:06,847
50 spread

3715
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:08,127
Oh come on

3716
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:13,503
12200

3717
02:54:17,599 --> 02:54:21,951
Child support

3718
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:28,351
We like the cake that the folks believe the government is coming down in the air

3719
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:42,175
Okay

3720
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:42,943
Admitting

3721
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:44,991
Play register they confiscate

3722
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:48,831
Okay but after it

3723
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:51,903
But it's okay

3724
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,695
In the interest of those before

3725
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:59,583
McDonald's

3726
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:09,055
So

3727
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:13,663
Especially on today of all days

3728
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:19,551
Gentlemen all the information isn't out yet as we record this but

3729
02:55:20,063 --> 02:55:21,343
Someone went into a church

3730
02:55:21,855 --> 02:55:23,135
Kill 27 people

3731
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:26,463
Wait what

3732
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:27,999
27

3733
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:31,327
He was 27 that's the last report I saw

3734
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:33,887
The number might change rabbits

3735
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:34,655
That's what I saw

3736
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:35,423
On

3737
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:36,191
Parking

3738
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:39,775
On a day like that I mean I know we're going back into

3739
02:55:40,031 --> 02:55:42,591
The past but it's important

3740
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:43,615
The principal

3741
02:55:43,871 --> 02:55:45,663
Versus the reality

3742
02:55:46,431 --> 02:55:46,943
And

3743
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:47,967
What makes

3744
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:49,759
Kaiser is presenting

3745
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:52,319
Is a reasonable Middle Ground

3746
02:55:52,575 --> 02:55:53,343
Not a bad idea

3747
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:55,647
It's a reasonable Middle Ground

3748
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:57,951
He's even presenting it as

3749
02:55:58,463 --> 02:55:58,975
Look

3750
02:55:59,231 --> 02:55:59,743
People are

3751
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:00,511
Pushing

3752
02:56:00,767 --> 02:56:01,535
Towards this

3753
02:56:01,791 --> 02:56:03,839
Wouldn't it be in people who are

3754
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:04,863
Strong gun

3755
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:05,887
Advocate

3756
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:07,167
Best interest

3757
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:07,935
2

3758
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:09,471
Live protest

3759
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:10,751
To their ability to have guns

3760
02:56:11,007 --> 02:56:14,847
Insurance would make reasonable for the idea behind it is

3761
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:17,407
Schooner or later

3762
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:18,687
Will be enough

3763
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:22,015
So like if your if your argument is or or

3764
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:24,319
Like when when he's describing Obama

3765
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:26,111
The drumbeat of

3766
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:28,671
When will enough be enough

3767
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:30,975
We all feel the

3768
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:32,767
His point is

3769
02:56:33,023 --> 02:56:34,303
Sooner or later it hatched

3770
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:36,607
To be there will be enough is enough

3771
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:38,911
And none of us want to come to the point where it's at

3772
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:43,519
Draconian just want to come to the point where there's a fascist State taken gun

3773
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:49,919
Right in the wall liberals as we are would be uncomfortable with that

3774
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:56,319
3 scariest you don't want you don't federal government of any kind

3775
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:58,111
Doing something along those

3776
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:01,695
Or state

3777
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:09,375
Especially not doing something like that

3778
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:11,935
In the same way that we

3779
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:14,239
Support all of the amendments

3780
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:15,519
We support the second

3781
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:17,055
Unfortunate

3782
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:21,407
God's will

3783
02:57:21,663 --> 02:57:23,455
But so his

3784
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:24,735
Hint ideas make

3785
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:26,015
Way too much

3786
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:28,063
His idea is

3787
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:29,087
Gun owners

3788
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:30,879
You don't want your guns taken away

3789
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:34,463
So rather than wait until they try and take them away

3790
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:36,767
And then have a fantastic shootout

3791
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:38,047
When none of us want

3792
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:39,327
None of us want that

3793
02:57:39,583 --> 02:57:40,863
Maybe instead be like

3794
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:43,167
Okay if you buy gun

3795
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:44,703
You also have to buy gun in

3796
02:57:45,471 --> 02:57:46,751
And if any gun

3797
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:48,287
Is used to hurt somebody

3798
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:49,567
That money

3799
02:57:50,591 --> 02:57:52,127
Well let's give

3800
02:57:52,383 --> 02:57:53,151
Let's go

3801
02:57:53,407 --> 02:57:56,223
Let's give a f****** real world example

3802
02:57:57,247 --> 02:57:58,527
Cuz I have

3803
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:01,855
Set a couple times on this episode that I bought a swing

3804
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:04,927
I bought a phone

3805
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:06,207
I bought a Nintendo switch

3806
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:12,351
Doing so

3807
02:58:13,119 --> 02:58:13,631
I had to

3808
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:14,655
The trade-in

3809
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:15,679
I didn't have to

3810
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:17,471
But I traded in my

3811
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:18,495
Wii U

3812
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:20,031
Because I was like I want

3813
02:58:20,287 --> 02:58:21,567
Some store credit in order

3814
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:23,359
In order to

3815
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:24,127
Appropriate

3816
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:26,175
Because otherwise it would be a crazy

3817
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:27,199
Too much

3818
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:29,247
And so I went

3819
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:30,015
To the store

3820
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:31,295
And they said

3821
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:32,575
Cool

3822
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:34,879
They looked at the Wii U they checked it out

3823
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:36,671
Maitre played well I wasn't

3824
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:39,743
For an ID

3825
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:42,303
They ran the ID and I like

3826
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:43,071
Your ideas

3827
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,375
Your IDs expired

3828
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:48,703
You can't trade in a video game system

3829
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:51,007
For another video game system

3830
02:58:52,287 --> 02:58:54,591
I probably could have bought a gun

3831
02:58:55,103 --> 02:58:56,895
Absolute I probably could have

3832
02:58:57,151 --> 02:58:58,175
Edit gun show

3833
02:58:58,431 --> 02:59:01,759
Or something like that without Eid

3834
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:08,159
Look in the same way I can still get into bars with an expired ID

3835
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:09,183
Absolutely

3836
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:13,279
Exactly what point I'm trying to make with

3837
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:14,303
But like

3838
02:59:14,559 --> 02:59:20,703
Maybe when trading in a video game system laws are more stringent

3839
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:22,495
Buying murder weapon laws

3840
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:24,799
Probably something going on

3841
02:59:25,055 --> 02:59:27,103
Yeah I had to go and

3842
02:59:27,871 --> 02:59:30,943
Really work out a plan

3843
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:34,527
I had to go get on a goddamn

3844
02:59:35,039 --> 02:59:36,063
We had to get on the bus

3845
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:38,111
That we weren't sure was coming because

3846
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:44,511
Is Broadway

3847
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:46,047
Together figuring out

3848
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:51,423
How it is you're going to get a f****** tendo switch hundred dollars less than a car

3849
02:59:51,679 --> 02:59:57,823
Weller time it is 8 it was a situation where Jordan was the best friend of the world and he came through for me

3850
02:59:58,079 --> 02:59:59,615
Maybe cuz he has a

3851
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:02,175
Current idea mine is expired in that

3852
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:04,223
Do you know what they say about George

3853
03:00:05,503 --> 03:00:06,527
His ideas always

3854
03:00:06,783 --> 03:00:07,807
These pot shop

3855
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:09,599
GameStop

3856
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:10,367
Follow

3857
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:12,927
And also

3858
03:00:13,695 --> 03:00:14,207
Sure

3859
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:17,023
Rest in peace Lou dog

3860
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,559
Nope don't care

3861
03:00:25,471 --> 03:00:26,495
Look I just thought about Lou.

3862
03:00:26,751 --> 03:00:29,567
Rest in peace logo

3863
03:00:31,103 --> 03:00:31,871
The

3864
03:00:33,663 --> 03:00:35,199
The thing that I keep coming back to

3865
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:37,503
2 is is this idea that

3866
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:41,087
I don't care

3867
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:44,671
I mean I was frustrated in the moment

3868
03:00:44,927 --> 03:00:45,695
But I get it

3869
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:48,255
Yeah I get why you have to have

3870
03:00:48,767 --> 03:00:49,535
Regulations

3871
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:50,303
In place of like

3872
03:00:51,071 --> 03:00:55,679
Someone traded in

3873
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,727
Piece of technology it's like a lap

3874
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:59,263
Top or something like that

3875
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:00,287
This point

3876
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:02,847
Back in the day was just a piece of plastic

3877
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:04,895
Nintendo

3878
03:01:05,151 --> 03:01:06,175
But now

3879
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:07,967
Now these things are like

3880
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:10,015
Multiple hundred dollars

3881
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:11,039
Worth

3882
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:11,807
2 of

3883
03:01:12,063 --> 03:01:13,855
It was frustrating

3884
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:14,623
Again

3885
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:16,415
And the idea of it

3886
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:19,743
Lobby Congress

3887
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:21,279
Or that I would be like

3888
03:01:22,047 --> 03:01:22,559
F*** you

3889
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:24,351
Video game

3890
03:01:24,607 --> 03:01:25,375
Trade-in right

3891
03:01:25,631 --> 03:01:26,399
Are Paramount

3892
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:27,167
Right

3893
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:28,703
And granted no one dies

3894
03:01:28,959 --> 03:01:29,727
Is because of this

3895
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:31,775
This example that I'm using but

3896
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:32,799
Look at

3897
03:01:33,311 --> 03:01:33,823
It's so

3898
03:01:34,335 --> 03:01:35,359
It's so silly to

3899
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:36,127
To me and then

3900
03:01:36,895 --> 03:01:38,175
The other piece of 1 take away 4

3901
03:01:38,687 --> 03:01:39,967
Is that Alex

3902
03:01:41,247 --> 03:01:42,015
Insurances attack

3903
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:43,295
That is

3904
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:48,159
No but that's

3905
03:01:48,415 --> 03:01:48,927
Again just

3906
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:51,231
Him not under the

3907
03:01:53,535 --> 03:01:54,047
Burnout

3908
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:55,583
Oh no

3909
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:58,399
No I'm going to end up in a garbage bag

3910
03:01:59,167 --> 03:02:03,263
I bet

3911
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:09,663
Me and me cross-dressing and ending up in a garbage bag

3912
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:12,735
So it's just him

3913
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:14,271
Misrepresenting

3914
03:02:14,527 --> 03:02:15,807
The Supreme Court's decision about a bomb

3915
03:02:17,343 --> 03:02:18,367
It's not about

3916
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:19,135
Obamacare

3917
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:20,671
It's about the

3918
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:21,439
Penalty

3919
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:23,743
It's about the penalty for not

3920
03:02:24,511 --> 03:02:25,023
Signing up

3921
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:28,607
Supreme Court did decide

3922
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:29,631
That it is

3923
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:32,703
Yeah

3924
03:02:33,471 --> 03:02:33,983
MS

3925
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:37,311
That makes sense

3926
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,591
Yeah it is

3927
03:02:40,127 --> 03:02:41,663
So the argument

3928
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,711
That conservatives always make

3929
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:44,735
Is

3930
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:45,503
You can't

3931
03:02:45,759 --> 03:02:46,527
Legislate

3932
03:02:46,783 --> 03:02:47,295
Morales

3933
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:48,831
Which

3934
03:02:49,087 --> 03:02:49,599
Is

3935
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:51,135
In a very very simple

3936
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:52,159
Mystic way

3937
03:02:52,671 --> 03:02:53,183
A truth

3938
03:02:53,951 --> 03:02:55,487
And at the same time

3939
03:02:55,743 --> 03:02:56,511
The dumbest

3940
03:02:56,767 --> 03:02:59,583
F****** thing that you could possibly say and if you say it

3941
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:00,863
Shut the fuk up forever

3942
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:02,143
Because

3943
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:06,239
The same way that you and I are that you tried

3944
03:03:06,495 --> 03:03:07,263
How to trade in a video game

3945
03:03:07,775 --> 03:03:08,287
Bright

3946
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:09,567
Now that law

3947
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:10,335
Is not

3948
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:12,383
Really going to affect

3949
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:13,151
The ton of people

3950
03:03:14,431 --> 03:03:16,479
If you have a legitimate ID

3951
03:03:16,991 --> 03:03:21,343
Even if you stole that f****** system it's going to only make

3952
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:22,879
Get traceable that this

3953
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:24,415
Person stole the

3954
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:25,183
Exact

3955
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:27,231
Woody was not going to

3956
03:03:27,487 --> 03:03:30,047
And who the f*** is going to follow up on it

3957
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:32,607
Unless somebody says my video games

3958
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:36,703
List all right like all of legislating morality

3959
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:38,495
Increasing

3960
03:03:38,751 --> 03:03:44,383
Two or three steps away from it every video game system

3961
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:50,271
Has a tracking number on it and everything will video game system that you have

3962
03:03:50,527 --> 03:03:51,551
Can be traced

3963
03:03:52,319 --> 03:03:52,831
Like this

3964
03:03:53,087 --> 03:03:56,927
Why they have serial numbers on them

3965
03:03:57,183 --> 03:04:00,511
Did they

3966
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,279
Can you buy them

3967
03:04:01,535 --> 03:04:03,583
If you buy them used they scan it.

3968
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:05,375
I mean it's not like

3969
03:04:05,887 --> 03:04:06,655
Oh my God

3970
03:04:06,911 --> 03:04:09,983
Big Brother they know but I have this

3971
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:12,543
If the records need to be pulled up

3972
03:04:13,055 --> 03:04:15,103
They can find out that I own a switch

3973
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:17,151
They can if need be

3974
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:23,807
And your phone stolen there's loads

3975
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:26,623
It's not always

3976
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:29,183
Evil right there are things that are

3977
03:04:29,695 --> 03:04:31,231
Simplest

3978
03:04:31,487 --> 03:04:34,303
The second best way of describing why

3979
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:35,071
You can't let

3980
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:36,095
Legislate morality

3981
03:04:36,607 --> 03:04:37,119
Stupid

3982
03:04:37,631 --> 03:04:38,143
Is

3983
03:04:38,655 --> 03:04:39,679
The

3984
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:41,215
I can't remember which

3985
03:04:41,727 --> 03:04:42,239
Halo lore

3986
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:43,007
Bridge or whatever

3987
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:44,799
But they just

3988
03:04:45,055 --> 03:04:45,823
There was a

3989
03:04:46,847 --> 03:04:50,175
Area where hundreds of people committed suicide every

3990
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:52,479
And all they did

3991
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:54,015
With a put-up

3992
03:04:55,807 --> 03:04:58,111
And all the sudden the suicide rate dropped

3993
03:04:58,623 --> 03:04:59,135
Sofas

3994
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:00,415
Because

3995
03:05:01,183 --> 03:05:01,951
That is not

3996
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:04,511
Legislating morality or anything like that

3997
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:05,791
But for a lot of

3998
03:05:06,047 --> 03:05:08,095
People if you just make something

3999
03:05:08,351 --> 03:05:09,631
Annoying to Logistics

4000
03:05:09,887 --> 03:05:10,911
They won't do it

4001
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:12,703
You want to jump off that bridge

4002
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:13,983
But you don't want to be seen

4003
03:05:14,495 --> 03:05:16,031
Seen climbing over the expanse

4004
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:20,383
Of human psychology that is just like

4005
03:05:21,663 --> 03:05:22,431
That seems like a lot

4006
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,479
Sure

4007
03:05:24,735 --> 03:05:26,783
That's really all it is really all

4008
03:05:27,039 --> 03:05:33,183
Taxes wind up being like you want and like we all want Rose we want all of this s*** but there's

4009
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:34,463
There's a certain point of like

4010
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:38,815
Like the soda tax in Chicago I think it was a good idea

4011
03:05:39,583 --> 03:05:41,119
And I think it should have worked

4012
03:05:41,375 --> 03:05:43,167
Find people b**** 2050

4013
03:05:43,423 --> 03:05:44,447
I know I agree

4014
03:05:44,703 --> 03:05:47,519
I'm right there with you

4015
03:05:47,775 --> 03:05:48,799
Distributor

4016
03:05:49,567 --> 03:05:51,359
It was going to end

4017
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:56,223
The Dynamics of it in terms of wholesale are

4018
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:57,759
Really problematic

4019
03:05:58,015 --> 03:06:01,343
Do the consumer I don't think it's that bad

4020
03:06:01,599 --> 03:06:03,391
Cuz like whatever I would buy soda

4021
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:06,207
I do think that it's f***** up that

4022
03:06:06,463 --> 03:06:07,231
Applied to Stelzer

4023
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:08,255
That's locked

4024
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:10,559
Time like

4025
03:06:14,655 --> 03:06:15,423
That's not like

4026
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:21,823
We were always like when it comes down to like wholesalers and

4027
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:26,175
But in terms of

4028
03:06:26,431 --> 03:06:27,711
The consumer pain

4029
03:06:27,967 --> 03:06:29,247
A couple cents more

4030
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:31,807
Per our Ascent more in Oz

4031
03:06:33,087 --> 03:06:34,111
Sugary beverages

4032
03:06:34,623 --> 03:06:35,391
I don't like

4033
03:06:35,903 --> 03:06:36,671
I don't think that's

4034
03:06:36,927 --> 03:06:38,719
Legislating morality

4035
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:39,743
I think that does

4036
03:06:39,999 --> 03:06:41,023
Coming to like

4037
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:43,327
And I want to be I don't want to eat this dick

4038
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:44,095
Because like

4039
03:06:44,607 --> 03:06:45,887
I drink soda Nitro

4040
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:46,655
Drink beer

4041
03:06:46,911 --> 03:06:47,423
And what have you

4042
03:06:47,679 --> 03:06:48,191
You fret

4043
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:51,007
If you charge

4044
03:06:51,263 --> 03:06:52,287
Me more for it

4045
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,335
Because of the burden

4046
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:55,871
That we all

4047
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:56,639
Collectively

4048
03:06:57,151 --> 03:06:57,919
Add in

4049
03:06:58,175 --> 03:06:58,687
2

4050
03:06:58,943 --> 03:06:59,455
The healthful

4051
03:06:59,967 --> 03:07:00,735
Yeah that makes

4052
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:01,503
Makes sense

4053
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:03,039
I accept

4054
03:07:03,295 --> 03:07:06,879
That we pay how much more for cigarettes

4055
03:07:07,135 --> 03:07:07,903
Then

4056
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:08,927
People in Missouri

4057
03:07:09,439 --> 03:07:11,231
I'd like Emily dollars

4058
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:12,255
Yeah

4059
03:07:12,511 --> 03:07:14,303
At least twice as much as you know what

4060
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:15,583
I'm f******

4061
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:20,959
Fine with that

4062
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:22,239
And it makes

4063
03:07:22,751 --> 03:07:23,263
Sense

4064
03:07:23,519 --> 03:07:29,151
I hope all that money goes to the right places

4065
03:07:30,175 --> 03:07:34,015
Conversation

4066
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:35,039
Look

4067
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:37,343
If you are going to make decisions

4068
03:07:37,855 --> 03:07:39,647
That burden everybody else

4069
03:07:39,903 --> 03:07:40,415
More

4070
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:41,951
You should

4071
03:07:42,463 --> 03:07:43,999
Of course pay more

4072
03:07:44,255 --> 03:07:44,767
To burden

4073
03:07:45,023 --> 03:07:45,535
Other people

4074
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:50,143
In order to lighten that burden for other people

4075
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:50,911
Polite

4076
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:52,959
Houses are politeness

4077
03:07:53,215 --> 03:07:54,751
And now the flip side of that is

4078
03:07:55,007 --> 03:07:57,311
I ate you see this out of like European Cup

4079
03:07:57,823 --> 03:07:58,847
He's a lot like people

4080
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:01,663
With the perspective of like I know that

4081
03:08:01,919 --> 03:08:04,479
My in my taxes are higher

4082
03:08:04,735 --> 03:08:05,503
Because

4083
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:08,575
More of it goes towards

4084
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:09,599
Protecting people who

4085
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:11,903
You need help and I don't care

4086
03:08:12,415 --> 03:08:13,183
Right

4087
03:08:13,695 --> 03:08:15,231
That's that's right where I live

4088
03:08:15,487 --> 03:08:16,511
I don't really give a she

4089
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:19,071
Look if if I have to pay more

4090
03:08:19,327 --> 03:08:21,375
I'm not saying that is like I'm

4091
03:08:21,631 --> 03:08:22,655
I'm a good person

4092
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:26,495
It just seems like how a society should operate

4093
03:08:27,519 --> 03:08:28,287
Think of it

4094
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:29,823
Really really simply

4095
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:32,127
Like the most simple form of that

4096
03:08:32,383 --> 03:08:33,151
We live in Chicago

4097
03:08:34,431 --> 03:08:38,271
Imagine you paid 10% more of your income into

4098
03:08:39,807 --> 03:08:41,343
And you never saw another home

4099
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:44,927
Well I know cuz that that makes

4100
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:45,951
Seem like the Imp

4101
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:47,487
This is never seeing homeless

4102
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:48,767
Events

4103
03:08:49,023 --> 03:08:49,535
But that

4104
03:08:49,791 --> 03:08:50,559
Is my point

4105
03:08:50,815 --> 03:08:56,959
Robert Wright if your motivation is cute but your motivation

4106
03:08:57,215 --> 03:09:00,031
Strongly disagree

4107
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:02,847
We can get into ethical arguments about

4108
03:09:03,103 --> 03:09:04,127
Determination

4109
03:09:04,383 --> 03:09:08,735
Anytime you want

4110
03:09:12,575 --> 03:09:13,343
Is the least

4111
03:09:13,855 --> 03:09:14,879
Watched show on TV

4112
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:18,207
Put put the point being if that's

4113
03:09:18,463 --> 03:09:23,071
If that's the motivation that you really have which it seems like for a lot of people who are anti

4114
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:25,375
It's always about

4115
03:09:25,631 --> 03:09:26,399
Well it's not

4116
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:27,679
Going towards what

4117
03:09:27,935 --> 03:09:28,959
I wanted to go.

4118
03:09:29,727 --> 03:09:31,263
If if you are soaked

4119
03:09:31,519 --> 03:09:33,055
Craven and so miserable

4120
03:09:33,567 --> 03:09:35,103
That all you really want is like

4121
03:09:35,615 --> 03:09:38,175
I'm mad that I have to walk by 30

4122
03:09:38,431 --> 03:09:39,199
F****** homeless

4123
03:09:39,455 --> 03:09:39,967
People everyday

4124
03:09:40,991 --> 03:09:41,503
Fine

4125
03:09:41,759 --> 03:09:43,551
Pay 10% more in tax

4126
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:45,343
And you'll never have

4127
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:46,111
To do that again

4128
03:09:46,623 --> 03:09:48,927
Version

4129
03:09:49,183 --> 03:09:50,719
Is bad like what are you talkin about

4130
03:09:50,975 --> 03:09:57,119
About when you started this allegory or this or the thought experiment I would have gone with is

4131
03:09:57,375 --> 03:09:58,655
10% more in taxes

4132
03:09:59,167 --> 03:10:00,959
And then everyone gets a good at

4133
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:01,727
Education

4134
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:03,007
That's what I would have gone with

4135
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:07,103
You know what remains

4136
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:11,455
Fink

4137
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:13,759
How many people bitching about property

4138
03:10:14,527 --> 03:10:19,135
Even though they ain't even though they know it goes towards School

4139
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:21,951
Like how insane is that

4140
03:10:22,207 --> 03:10:22,719
Yeah

4141
03:10:22,975 --> 03:10:26,303
You know that this goes towards only helping

4142
03:10:26,815 --> 03:10:32,959
Your own children neighborhood the children of others in your still like I don't want to

4143
03:10:33,983 --> 03:10:37,055
Percent in the Robert seriously no one complains about the lottery

4144
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:38,847
Yeah no good

4145
03:10:39,103 --> 03:10:41,663
They only complain about the people who were Tom enough

4146
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,711
Famously described as a

4147
03:10:43,967 --> 03:10:44,735
Facts on the dumb

4148
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:47,551
And that's the only

4149
03:10:48,831 --> 03:10:49,343
Don't ask me

4150
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:51,903
I'm not a good person

4151
03:10:52,671 --> 03:10:53,183
In this regard

4152
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:54,463
Respond way out of

4153
03:10:54,975 --> 03:10:55,743
But

4154
03:10:55,999 --> 03:10:58,303
The point I wanted to make about this tax

4155
03:10:58,559 --> 03:10:59,071
Supreme Court

4156
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:02,143
Is that

4157
03:11:03,935 --> 03:11:04,447
Penalty

4158
03:11:05,215 --> 03:11:07,263
For not signing up for Obamacare

4159
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:09,055
Is covered under the

4160
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:11,103
Yeah and it's

4161
03:11:12,127 --> 03:11:13,919
Maybe definable is attacks

4162
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:14,943
But it's

4163
03:11:15,455 --> 03:11:16,223
Entirely

4164
03:11:16,479 --> 03:11:16,991
Justified

4165
03:11:17,503 --> 03:11:19,551
Only thing that makes sense

4166
03:11:20,063 --> 03:11:21,343
Yeah cuz why would you

4167
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:25,183
But look the whole container

4168
03:11:26,719 --> 03:11:28,767
It's a specific thing that Alex

4169
03:11:29,023 --> 03:11:29,535
Calling out

4170
03:11:30,303 --> 03:11:31,327
B insurance

4171
03:11:31,583 --> 03:11:32,351
Is a text

4172
03:11:32,607 --> 03:11:33,887
And that's not true

4173
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:34,911
It's true

4174
03:11:35,167 --> 03:11:35,935
In the case of

4175
03:11:36,191 --> 03:11:36,703
This

4176
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:38,751
Specific Supreme Court

4177
03:11:39,007 --> 03:11:40,287
Which is about the penalty

4178
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:42,335
For not signing up for Obama

4179
03:11:42,847 --> 03:11:44,383
They determined it was

4180
03:11:45,151 --> 03:11:45,919
Largely

4181
03:11:46,175 --> 03:11:47,455
Definable is attack

4182
03:11:47,711 --> 03:11:50,271
Yeah Insurance itself is not

4183
03:11:51,295 --> 03:11:52,319
Car insurance isn't.

4184
03:11:53,343 --> 03:11:54,623
Your Healthcare

4185
03:11:54,879 --> 03:11:56,415
If you have insurance

4186
03:11:56,671 --> 03:11:58,207
Outside of Obamacare

4187
03:11:58,719 --> 03:12:00,767
Isn't

4188
03:12:01,535 --> 03:12:02,559
Other insurance

4189
03:12:02,815 --> 03:12:04,607
Does home insurance renters insurance

4190
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:06,143
That's not attack

4191
03:12:06,655 --> 03:12:08,703
Do you know what they are hacks is not

4192
03:12:09,727 --> 03:12:10,239
I'm sorry

4193
03:12:10,495 --> 03:12:11,775
Insurance is not

4194
03:12:12,031 --> 03:12:12,543
Pat

4195
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,335
So Alex making that argument

4196
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,103
As a

4197
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:18,431
Shoutout Max Keiser

4198
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:20,991
That's not his argument falls apart

4199
03:12:21,503 --> 03:12:22,015
Furthermore

4200
03:12:23,807 --> 03:12:26,111
Insurance itself is a socialist country

4201
03:12:27,135 --> 03:12:30,975
The idea of insurance is you are subsidizing people

4202
03:12:32,767 --> 03:12:33,535
Need help

4203
03:12:34,303 --> 03:12:36,095
It is the larger group of people

4204
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:37,375
DuckDuckGo

4205
03:12:37,631 --> 03:12:43,775
Almost everything about Society is a slight social attractive

4206
03:12:44,031 --> 03:12:48,639
Mad about Gunn insurance and not about health insurance

4207
03:12:49,663 --> 03:12:50,687
Profiting company

4208
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:57,343
To get money from u.s. parody

4209
03:12:57,599 --> 03:13:03,487
To make sure that this happened

4210
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:07,583
Pre-existing condition bulshit or any number of Byzantine laws

4211
03:13:07,839 --> 03:13:12,959
To keep them from getting the benefit that they themselves have paid into this entire time

4212
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:13,983
You're like

4213
03:13:14,495 --> 03:13:15,519
Prosperity

4214
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:17,055
You prosperity

4215
03:13:17,311 --> 03:13:17,823
F*** you

4216
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:24,223
Prosperity Gospel understand what socialism

4217
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:24,991
Guarantee gospel

4218
03:13:25,503 --> 03:13:27,039
Cuz he doesn't like

4219
03:13:27,295 --> 03:13:29,855
Yeah like you talked about the glitterbug churches

4220
03:13:30,623 --> 03:13:33,183
What is the Prosperity Gospel that's the the

4221
03:13:36,255 --> 03:13:37,535
Donating money to a church

4222
03:13:37,791 --> 03:13:38,815
To get your own money

4223
03:13:44,447 --> 03:13:46,239
He's just the sovereignty preacher

4224
03:13:47,775 --> 03:13:48,287
And

4225
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:51,359
To a certain extent

4226
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:53,919
Just this week

4227
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:56,223
I know that this sound

4228
03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:00,319
It's crazy cuz it's been 11

4229
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:01,087
It sounds crazy

4230
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:02,367
But just this week

4231
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:04,159
Kind of dawned on me

4232
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:04,927
How

4233
03:14:05,951 --> 03:14:06,975
121

4234
03:14:07,231 --> 03:14:07,743
It is

4235
03:14:07,999 --> 03:14:09,023
Just the

4236
03:14:09,535 --> 03:14:10,559
You flatter him

4237
03:14:11,327 --> 03:14:11,839
And it works out

4238
03:14:12,095 --> 03:14:12,863
Right he loves

4239
03:14:13,375 --> 03:14:17,471
Right and what made it so clear is this s*** with the Nation of Islam

4240
03:14:18,495 --> 03:14:19,519
Cuz for the

4241
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:22,591
11 months that we've been going through this hoop and screaming

4242
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:24,639
The Nation of Islam

4243
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:28,991
Take that white people are

4244
03:14:29,247 --> 03:14:32,831
Baby disability every manufacturer

4245
03:14:33,087 --> 03:14:34,623
They want the white people to come out

4246
03:14:34,879 --> 03:14:35,391
Etc

4247
03:14:35,647 --> 03:14:36,671
Exactly

4248
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:39,487
He goes in

4249
03:14:39,743 --> 03:14:40,255
And they prefer

4250
03:14:40,511 --> 03:14:41,023
Tend

4251
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:42,047
That they like him

4252
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:45,119
Black bear Inn

4253
03:14:45,631 --> 03:14:46,655
They make a lot of sense

4254
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:50,751
They're the best

4255
03:14:51,007 --> 03:14:52,799
It Dawns on me that like

4256
03:14:56,383 --> 03:14:57,663
I don't know why we're doing this

4257
03:14:57,919 --> 03:15:00,479
Podcast life

4258
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:08,159
This guy is so simple

4259
03:15:09,183 --> 03:15:11,231
We're making this very complicated

4260
03:15:11,743 --> 03:15:13,791
And he is more complicated than that Billy up

4261
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:14,559
Cuz of his

4262
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:16,095
I mean

4263
03:15:16,607 --> 03:15:17,119
Soft

4264
03:15:17,631 --> 03:15:18,655
Stance on Hitler

4265
03:15:18,911 --> 03:15:25,055
There are those things that are like I still

4266
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:27,615
Don't like the idea that there is a soft

4267
03:15:27,871 --> 03:15:32,479
Stay at Saint Hitler there are those things that are worth discussing

4268
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:36,063
I think I said this in like

4269
03:15:36,575 --> 03:15:37,855
Maybe one of the First episodes

4270
03:15:38,111 --> 03:15:38,623
We did like

4271
03:15:39,647 --> 03:15:41,695
So much of this I could have just

4272
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:42,463
Assumed

4273
03:15:46,047 --> 03:15:52,191
I think everyone hates him is right but they're not right for the right reason

4274
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:56,799
Hasn't listened

4275
03:15:58,079 --> 03:15:58,591
For the wrong reasons

4276
03:15:58,847 --> 03:16:01,151
Right it's so complicated

4277
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:01,919
There's this

4278
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:02,943
Thread

4279
03:16:03,455 --> 03:16:06,527
I sincerely believe I mean our society will fall

4280
03:16:07,039 --> 03:16:09,855
In one day or not

4281
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:10,623
It will

4282
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:13,439
Yeah and I think that one of the most in

4283
03:16:13,951 --> 03:16:17,535
Think things will be the millions of people who were LED astray

4284
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:18,815
Bye

4285
03:16:19,071 --> 03:16:19,583
Nothing

4286
03:16:20,095 --> 03:16:20,863
Yeah

4287
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:21,631
Nothing

4288
03:16:22,911 --> 03:16:23,423
But he's not

4289
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:27,263
Example of that there were there were caught

4290
03:16:27,519 --> 03:16:29,055
There were PT Barnum's

4291
03:16:29,311 --> 03:16:30,335
Long time

4292
03:16:33,407 --> 03:16:33,919
It's just

4293
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:35,455
We have the

4294
03:16:35,711 --> 03:16:36,223
Advantage

4295
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:37,503
All of it being

4296
03:16:37,759 --> 03:16:40,063
Recorded is available

4297
03:16:40,319 --> 03:16:41,343
You can

4298
03:16:41,855 --> 03:16:42,367
Take him to task

4299
03:16:42,623 --> 03:16:43,135
Ask like

4300
03:16:43,647 --> 03:16:44,159
Back in the day like

4301
03:16:44,415 --> 03:16:45,183
PT Barnum again

4302
03:16:45,695 --> 03:16:46,463
Cuz I just said

4303
03:16:48,255 --> 03:16:48,767
He wasn't on

4304
03:16:49,535 --> 03:16:51,583
When he said the shipping center

4305
03:16:51,839 --> 03:16:53,375
We just get the advantage of like

4306
03:16:53,631 --> 03:16:54,143
It's there

4307
03:16:56,447 --> 03:17:00,031
I don't know why I mean ultimately

4308
03:17:00,287 --> 03:17:02,079
As much as I love all of you

4309
03:17:02,591 --> 03:17:03,103
Policy wonk

4310
03:17:03,871 --> 03:17:06,175
We're doing this for pasta

4311
03:17:06,943 --> 03:17:08,479
No

4312
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:10,271
It is

4313
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:13,599
It is one of those somewhere

4314
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:20,255
There there is

4315
03:17:20,767 --> 03:17:21,791
Certainly

4316
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:24,351
A section of the the world that isn't

4317
03:17:24,607 --> 03:17:25,119
Interstate Inn

4318
03:17:25,887 --> 03:17:26,655
Analysis

4319
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:29,215
It is just

4320
03:17:29,471 --> 03:17:30,495
This might be an author

4321
03:17:30,751 --> 03:17:33,055
Conversation

4322
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:35,615
There's so many things where

4323
03:17:36,127 --> 03:17:38,431
You can take a very very

4324
03:17:38,687 --> 03:17:39,455
Specific sub

4325
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:42,015
And by looking at that subject

4326
03:17:42,271 --> 03:17:43,807
You can extrapolate the world

4327
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:49,951
Sure and this is what I see our Podcast Addict I just told you all about it

4328
03:17:50,207 --> 03:17:50,719
Exact

4329
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:53,279
Wheat through through this

4330
03:17:53,535 --> 03:17:54,559
Tiny little box

4331
03:17:54,815 --> 03:17:55,327
The prism

4332
03:17:55,583 --> 03:17:57,887
Through the tiny little box we can see the world

4333
03:17:58,655 --> 03:17:59,423
And it's

4334
03:17:59,935 --> 03:18:00,703
Become so much

4335
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:01,471
Clearer

4336
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:02,495
When you

4337
03:18:02,751 --> 03:18:03,775
Have this kind of

4338
03:18:04,031 --> 03:18:04,543
Small roof

4339
03:18:04,799 --> 03:18:05,311
Like its

4340
03:18:06,335 --> 03:18:11,711
Alright

4341
03:18:12,991 --> 03:18:13,503
Respond

4342
03:18:13,759 --> 03:18:14,271
What you were saying

4343
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:15,807
I'm interested

4344
03:18:16,063 --> 03:18:17,343
I'm super interested

4345
03:18:19,391 --> 03:18:20,671
Evidence by all my

4346
03:18:22,207 --> 03:18:28,095
The conversation about our listeners disagree with you

4347
03:18:28,351 --> 03:18:29,887
Didn't what's real

4348
03:18:30,655 --> 03:18:32,191
The best way I think

4349
03:18:32,703 --> 03:18:33,983
To discuss that

4350
03:18:34,751 --> 03:18:36,031
Is talking about someone who's

4351
03:18:36,543 --> 03:18:40,895
Totally full of s*** because you have these like

4352
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:46,271
I made where Alex is right again

4353
03:18:46,527 --> 03:18:47,295
The kernel of right

4354
03:18:47,807 --> 03:18:49,087
Falsity

4355
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:50,111
The media sucks

4356
03:18:50,623 --> 03:18:51,135
Yeah like

4357
03:18:51,391 --> 03:18:55,231
You you have all this stuff on social media on Twitter on Facebook

4358
03:18:55,487 --> 03:18:57,023
All these stories that are not

4359
03:18:57,279 --> 03:18:57,791
True

4360
03:18:58,559 --> 03:19:00,095
Pander to whatever your

4361
03:19:00,351 --> 03:19:06,495
Pre-existing condition is or what about like trying to

4362
03:19:06,751 --> 03:19:08,287
Rabat the Donna brazile.

4363
03:19:08,543 --> 03:19:09,311
Right

4364
03:19:09,567 --> 03:19:10,335
Oh my God

4365
03:19:10,591 --> 03:19:13,407
Trucking killed through so much stuff

4366
03:19:14,431 --> 03:19:14,943
I get it

4367
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:15,711
I get it

4368
03:19:18,015 --> 03:19:19,295
You and I sitting around

4369
03:19:19,807 --> 03:19:20,831
Trying to do a

4370
03:19:21,087 --> 03:19:22,367
Progressive show

4371
03:19:22,879 --> 03:19:23,647
Would be a disaster

4372
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:25,183
Because

4373
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:31,839
We could if we tried you just like to do an analog of Alex's show

4374
03:19:32,095 --> 03:19:32,607
Photo

4375
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:34,655
If we tried to do a news show

4376
03:19:35,935 --> 03:19:36,703
It'll be a disaster

4377
03:19:38,239 --> 03:19:38,751
No because

4378
03:19:39,007 --> 03:19:40,287
Everything moves so goddamn

4379
03:19:41,567 --> 03:19:42,847
It'll be like

4380
03:19:43,103 --> 03:19:43,871
What do we cover

4381
03:19:44,383 --> 03:19:45,919
The Edward get pricked by thing

4382
03:19:46,175 --> 03:19:47,199
Probably

4383
03:19:47,455 --> 03:19:51,295
I mean you have the immediacy of needing to do the show right

4384
03:19:51,551 --> 03:19:54,367
Whereas we have

4385
03:19:54,623 --> 03:19:56,927
I haven't heard of a

4386
03:19:57,183 --> 03:19:57,951
Complete liar

4387
03:19:58,207 --> 03:19:58,719
Yeah

4388
03:19:59,999 --> 03:20:00,767
You can find

4389
03:20:01,023 --> 03:20:01,535
Truth

4390
03:20:01,791 --> 03:20:02,303
From

4391
03:20:02,559 --> 03:20:04,607
Pinging off that light

4392
03:20:06,655 --> 03:20:07,679
Sometimes they're not lying

4393
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:09,215
Very rare

4394
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:10,751
But sometimes they're not lying

4395
03:20:11,007 --> 03:20:11,775
Ragtime

4396
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:14,847
You get to see what is there presentation

4397
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:16,895
Looking

4398
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:17,919
Right

4399
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:21,247
And that is that to me is a much better

4400
03:20:21,503 --> 03:20:23,039
That's what the news maybe need

4401
03:20:23,295 --> 03:20:23,807
Baby needs

4402
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:24,575
To become

4403
03:20:24,831 --> 03:20:25,343
Yeah

4404
03:20:25,599 --> 03:20:26,111
Essentially

4405
03:20:26,367 --> 03:20:26,879
Debunking

4406
03:20:27,647 --> 03:20:28,159
Bulshit

4407
03:20:28,415 --> 03:20:28,927
And there are

4408
03:20:29,183 --> 03:20:29,695
2 truth

4409
03:20:29,951 --> 03:20:30,463
I think week

4410
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:31,487
You can draw from this podcast

4411
03:20:32,255 --> 03:20:33,279
First

4412
03:20:34,303 --> 03:20:35,327
Poor Eddie Bravo

4413
03:20:35,583 --> 03:20:36,095
That it

4414
03:20:36,863 --> 03:20:38,143
Such a sweet man

4415
03:20:38,655 --> 03:20:39,167

We are on Facebook

4423
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:02,975
And then I think

4424
03:21:03,231 --> 03:21:04,255
Ultimate second

4425
03:21:04,767 --> 03:21:05,791
That I was

4426
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:08,863
Was that

4427
03:21:09,375 --> 03:21:10,143
Unlike a Libra

4428
03:21:11,167 --> 03:21:11,935
A poor

4429
03:21:12,703 --> 03:21:13,215
Sweet

4430
03:21:14,239 --> 03:21:15,007
Innocent

4431
03:21:18,079 --> 03:21:19,103
Complicated world

4432
03:21:19,359 --> 03:21:19,871
Strongly

4433
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:21,151
Disagree with wherever you're going

4434
03:21:21,663 --> 03:21:22,943
This poor fool

4435
03:21:23,199 --> 03:21:25,503
Strongly disagree with us who has no chance

4436
03:21:25,759 --> 03:21:26,783
Of Survivor

4437
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:29,343
Unlike him

4438
03:21:29,855 --> 03:21:30,367
There are

4439
03:21:31,647 --> 03:21:32,671
Oh oh

4440
03:21:33,183 --> 03:21:33,695
Now I'm back

4441
03:21:33,951 --> 03:21:34,719
There are

4442
03:21:34,975 --> 03:21:35,487
Bearded

4443
03:21:36,767 --> 03:21:40,095
There are men I thought you were trying to present the bearded guy as a

4444
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:45,215
F****** sympathetic figure I misunderstood

4445
03:21:45,471 --> 03:21:46,239
Poor Eddie Bravo

4446
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:47,519
Anyway

4447
03:21:48,543 --> 03:21:49,823
I accept your apology

4448
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:50,847
Even though it is

4449
03:21:51,103 --> 03:21:51,615
Tacitly

4450
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:52,895
Not give it I miss her

4451
03:21:54,431 --> 03:21:56,735
There are there are these

4452
03:22:00,319 --> 03:22:01,599
Refuse to hang

4453
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:05,695
When they were young

4454
03:22:05,951 --> 03:22:07,743
Had all of their teeth removed

4455
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:09,023
And replaced

4456
03:22:09,279 --> 03:22:10,303
By CIA.

4457
03:22:10,815 --> 03:22:11,839
Insist on

4458
03:22:12,095 --> 03:22:14,143
Counseling Owen Shroyer

4459
03:22:15,423 --> 03:22:17,727
Given so many Owen fryers

4460
03:22:17,983 --> 03:22:21,311
Vaccines and then deny that vaccines work

4461
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:25,151
Exactly it rhymes

4462
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:27,967
There's a kernel of truth to it and I'll tell you about this guy

4463
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:30,271
I'll tell you Dan

4464
03:22:32,319 --> 03:22:33,855
Jon rappoport can go f*** himself

4465
03:22:34,367 --> 03:22:35,135
In this case

4466
03:22:35,391 --> 03:22:35,903
I agree

4467
03:22:42,559 --> 03:22:46,399
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work
