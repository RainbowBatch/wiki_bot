The movie would be situations

65
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,671
You know over there are two stories that I consider to be ongoing

66
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Okay developing stories

67
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,631
The first was our last episode we discussed our special on Saturday

68
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
The episode Alex came to the studio on his day off

69
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
And interviewed Mancow

70
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
Did not interview Rodger Rodger was not there

71
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823

Storyline

75
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,951
We need to see what Rodger says when he shows up on it

76
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Can only assume that Rodger shows up from minute

77
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375

00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,335
There's been clamoring to know what that will be

116
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
Don't worry about it

117
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391

$15,000 to $10,000

134
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
I think so but it could be

135
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,015
And focusing on instead of all the

136
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Confirm

137
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Roll-up of huge Global pedophile rings

138
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Could be a setup

139
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
To distract us

140
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863

00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Pacific Service

197
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Is that. Later

198
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Pretty racist on this episode

199
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
Is based on how he covers

200
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Various stories

201
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,127
And this is the chief one of them is the big story that you covering in a

202
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
White identity White

203
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Fear Manor that's a

204
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
The story does not necessarily match

205
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Young white mother

206
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
I asked you to my black

207
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Mob

208
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Legitly saying all lives matter

209
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Checkpoints

210
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Well baby I went Gaga

211
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
In the head

212
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
I guess you deserve it

213
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
So this is Dory that Alex is

214
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Completely misrepresenting

215
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
That I'm not minimizing the tragedy of unnecessary

216
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Arena story justify

217
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Shooting

218
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
My only point is that the available information

219
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Completely contradicted Alex's reporting

220
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
Because he doesn't actually care about the reality of the story

221
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
He's interested in creating a

222
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Beer

223
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
White people of non-white

224
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
That's always

225
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
This is about a woman from Indianapolis named Jessica Whitaker who was shot

226
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
Killed in the very early morning

227
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Hours of July 5th

228
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,831
She was walking with her fiance and two other friends the other canal and Indianapolis around 3 a.m.

229
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,695
As a group passed a group of strangers one of the people in Whitakers group was overheard saying the n word

230
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,583
Strangers responded by yelling blacklivesmatter reply.

231
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
What happens next from the article about this in the Daily Mail

232
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
Her fiance quotes said both groups branded guns at each other

233
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
And walked away from each other

234
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
So it appears that everything was all right but apparently it was

235
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:23,135
This group of strangers initially shot at them and fire was returned and sadly Miss Whittaker.

236
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,535
Incidentally this is the second homicide that's taken place in this stretch of the Indianapolis canal in just that week

237
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
Previously a fourteen-year-old was shot allegedly the result of an adult shooting him in self-defense after the youth attempted to pull off and on

238
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Armed robbery

239
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
So this is

240
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
Maybe if an area where there's a little bit of crime going on right now

241
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
It seems like everybody's

242
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
This is an awful story but you can easily and pretty immediately see the factual misrepresentations that Alex has added to his version of

243
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,863
He doesn't mention that it was a 3 in the morning and the altercation began because someone use the n-word

244
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
That's not to say

245
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
That justifies a shooting reporting the story

246
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,919
Two-story have cast these people as black lives matter protesters who

247
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
Glm

248
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
It when they say all lives matter their executor

249
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,415
This is obviously not at all accurate from the available reporting on the story

250
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
I want to start the story with the victim and suspect who yelled black lives matter

251
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
His imagination

252
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
The pieces fall into

253
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,311
Very deeply races person would do

254
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Bcomplete mister

255
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Reporting of stories like this

256
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Specifically for the reason of creating racially-charged

257
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
And I think honestly doing something like this

258
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
The regularity

259
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
Hey more damning than if you just said slurs on air

260
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
Yeah this is worse

261
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,143
Decide

262
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Scale of a butt

263
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
I think at this dinner tomorrow

264
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
Yeah I mean slur is awful inoffensive

265
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
It's not necessarily

266
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Always

267
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Inciting a bunch of

268
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,759
Passionate passionate gun weirdos into believing that every black person is coming to

269
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
F****** EX

270
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Execute them if they don't swear

271
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
Fealty to Black lives matter

272
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
Yeah exactly

273
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
Jurist

274
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Especially when the actual

275
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Basis

276
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
The story that he's basing it on

277
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
It doesn't match

278
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,431
Anyway here's another story that turns into a racial story

279
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Confined

280
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Subway video shows arrangement

281
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
White people on the New York subway

282
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Beyond your nose anywhere

283
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,535
You can find plenty of stories about this and Outlets like New York poster The Daily Mail

284
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
It's not something that's being ignored by the media as much as it is more

285
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
Everything I can tell there's a story about a mentally unwell person

286
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Two people on a train which sucks but it's not national news

287
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,943
The suspect was arrested on charges of attempted murder among other

288
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,039
Both of the victims who were in their 70s survived and are in stable condition

289
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
So that's Brightside

290
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
Far less severe of a story that I would be

291
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,255
Headed to New York or

292
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
You know

293
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
You know what even not losing

294
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
The idea that everybody needs

295
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
We talkin about

296
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
The black guy

297
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Is Bowser

298
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
There's an important distinction to grab that all

299
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
And that is just because the person who happens to commit this crime

300
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
That doesn't mean this is really involved at all

301
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
In this case I can see no evidence that race was a factor in the crime

302
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
Suzanne ageist cry

303
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
Suspect

304
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Before commencing

305
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,543
Galaxy sees a black guy attack a white person believes or at least report

306
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
Because the guy was white

307
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
That's really stupid way to look at things

308
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
But when you

309
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,991
Racism

310
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,599
Operate this way when the races are reverse

311
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,255
When a white person commits a crime to justify why racism isn't involved at all

312
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,863
To do is look back to his coverage of Ahmad Arbury Skilling as a perfect example

313
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Somehow this doesn't play out

314
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
The same way

315
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
It in those circumstances and again this is just a

316
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Fingerprinting

317
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Of a deeply racist broke

318
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
He spends all of his

319
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
This time with Ahmad arbery

320
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
To explain

321
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,783
Morphe

322
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,135
Yeah

323
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
And it's so much like

324
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,815
Is emblematic of a complete inability to understand

325
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Why

326
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
Or if it's a

327
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
It worth it

328
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Play Pure ability

329
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
You understand

330
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
You know what I'm saying like this

331
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
This is a rebuttal

332
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Two people pointing out the

333
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Horrific police violence

334
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
The racist

335
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
The tax in the fuc

336
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,735
That are still f****** going on

337
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,343
And they are emblematic of a long long history of

338
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Pulling up any kind of like

339
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Will see a black person hurt a white person

340
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
As a as a defense against

341
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,839
It is either misunderstanding that each individual Act

342
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
Is part of a larger hole that knee

343
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Corrected

344
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Thunder standings

345
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
And we have to find

346
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
You know what I'm saying

347
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
I think that

348
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Tavares

349
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
The biggest issue is an

350
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
Willingness to recognize that sometime

351
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,111
When their crimes with white victim that's not because they're white

352
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
You know

353
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,768
Honestly like me bringing up the Gaze of them is almost

354
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,352
This case because you can make a very strong argument that the reason

355
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Was because

356
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Pretty

357
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Compelling racial component

358
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,688
This point I don't know what information

359
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,808
Reporting I can find have any racial

360
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
Component to what would he did it all

361
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
I don't know it's just

362
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
He's trying to imagine it in

363
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Into a rebuttal

364
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,216
About the situation with a couple St Louis

365
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,104
It turns out that they have ended up having their home search

366
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
Navigation going on

367
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,296
Top of St Louis couple defend home

368
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
Confiscated

369
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
George Soros

370
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
George Soros

371
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
Apparently this couple of the mckloskey's

372
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Team was confiscated

373
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
There's an investigation

374
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:42,944
Into them because they were straight up pointing guns at people and Patricia McCloskey had her finger on the trigger of a pistol

375
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
Under normal circumstances that is illegal

376
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
To brandish a weapon

377
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
Somebody comes really complicated when you start to factor in ideas of

378
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Self-defense

379
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Stand-your-ground

380
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
The castle doctrine

381
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
It's an open question about whether or not the argument of feeling threatened

382
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Being just

383
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Poseidon Brandon

384
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Weapons and self-defense

385
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Is valid

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,800
And the fact Patricia it was pointing a gun at people and had no firearms training

387
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Great

388
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
Legally they're probably going to end up fine

389
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
I'm going to guess

390
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Crazy up there not

391
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
They're not cool

392
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
Hey if you guys get him for this this

393
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
Sbirs taken down Capone

394
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,096
There's a long history of s*** that I'm not sure they're bootleg

395
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
Missouri is not involved in

396
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
In the case at all

397
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
The investigation is that a circuit attorney Kimberly Gardner

398
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,920
No Alex has her position wrong

399
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Garner want her election to the circuit

400
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Attorney's office in 20

401
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
917

402
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
And she did accept funding from a Super PAC called the safety of Justice

403
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Committee which Soros did donate

404
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
There's a little

405
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,352
Everybody

406
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Not for any

407
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,264
So Alex Goes International

408
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,848
What's he doing outside

409
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Police say that a good job

410
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Lowe's in Ireland

411
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,440
And video

412
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,304
It's tough to say exactly what's going on and then some loud music

413
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
It starts playing

414
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
The camera Cuts over to two people holding up a banner that says

415
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
You fascists bound to lose

416
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Suicide up of what looks like at least

417
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
5 amps

418
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,152
Then descends on them tears up the banner a kickover the amps

419
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,784
And it doesn't look like it's hard to keep track of where people are in the crowd but I would not be surprised they got roughed up a cup

420
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
This was challenging but I was able to find some

421
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Alright

422
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
This is an event that is called an anti pedophilia rally in the same way

423
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
Some college campuses are pro free speech

424
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
It's essentially an extreme right-wing group using the cover of something that you probably

425
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
Possibly be against in order to give them cover

426
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
Operate their stealthier agenda

427
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
You see this a lot with people like Tommy Robin

428
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Engage in horrific

429
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,504
Anti-muslim agitation in demonization

430
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
You're accused

431
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Supporting The Grooming

432
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Stop

433
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
Yeah it's a really standard

434
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
Ireland

435
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Inside with his video

436
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,584
Justin Bieber

437
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Be leader of the National Party

438
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:48,032
According to the beacon in 1998 book called The National Way Forward in Wichita

439
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Configured according to Catholic Doctrine

440
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
And the creation of a Catholic dictator

441
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
That's always worked well in the past for Ireland

442
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,112
This he argues that the only way to save Ireland from the scourge of liberalism and immorality

443
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
He's actually opposed to immigration entirely against Reproductive Rights

444
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,768
It's to the point of advocating the death penalty for abortion doctors

445
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,864
Decriminalisation of homosexuality and divorce

446
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,984
I want at least three occasions you spoken at events held by the German Neo-Nazi party

447
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Cmpd

448
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
Including one event in 2000 where he was

449
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
The guest of honor

450
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,944
In 2002 in the Irish Times

451
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Described as a coach stinging rebuke

452
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
Barrett from John Smith

453
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Who's the spokesperson of the anti-abortion

454
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
I'm pro-life

455
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Campaign

456
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
Even

457
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Christ

458
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Quote

459
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
No amount of evasion or spin on mr. Barrett's Park in

460
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Explain

461
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Seriousness of attending such conference

462
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
It's nonsense to contend

463
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
Speaking at a neo-fascist Rallys serve the interest of building a more caring pro-life culture

464
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
Rights agenda which she claims to espouse

465
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
The groups with which Mr Barratt in the center reported

466
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,760
Be Associated have an agenda of social exclusion and political extremism

467
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
I'm sorry

468
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
From ethos of respecting moderation

469
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
The pro-life movement

470
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
You know keep your scoffing aside and whatever sure your point is valid

471
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Ignited like this guy

472
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
If you're there you're gone

473
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,032
Even ideological allies in the

474
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,872
Barrett was a leader of a Irish group called youth defense

475
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
Which is mentioned in that guy's quote which is a really bad girl

476
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:37,600
Npd's youth division DeYoung National Democrats held a conference in 1999 where Barrett spoke

477
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
By virtue of his connection with you

478
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
Defense

479
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,512
Also in attendance

480
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
This is the guy who is running his rally in Ireland

481
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,936
Kind of makes sense that there were some counter demonstrators protest

482
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,848
It's very easy to pretend that their protest was somehow anti anti pedophilia

483
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Who's holding the rally

484
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
You should

485
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,480
Get the picture that this rally was not anti pedophile to begin with

486
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,832
Anti pedophile

487
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Bear

488
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,256
Pedophile rally we do start with a Sig Heil but that's like

489
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
That's just tradition

490
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
That's it's not about that

491
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
It's not about those

492
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
Okay sure that's wise because everywhere

493
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:28,288
Pictures of people holding signs

494
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568

Cancel culture there

00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
The discourse

499
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
About a buddy of his

00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Stand up

Weird voice

Tucker Carlson

512
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
Stop writer

513
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
I've been using an alias

514
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,112
Insects with stuff on a web forum

515
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:24,608
Between some material posted or saw in the Forum and Carlson the show

516
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
This is a guy

517
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,984
Reporter at the Daily Caller

518
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
What is a Blog Tucker

519
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Co-founded

520
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Is the guy work for Tucker and Tucker adjacent

521
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
Which makes it a little hard to shrug off is just like the random employees

522
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:49,440
Current behavior

523
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,792
Jewel

524
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Is also a quote from

525
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Carlson is reading off the teleprompter

526
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
What does it mean

527
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Chirp

528
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
Resigned on Friday and then on Monday which is

529
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:20,416
Just suspicious

530
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Sure.

531
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Around the World in 80 Days

532
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,448
The situation

533
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
In fact the guy who post

534
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Racist kid online

535
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Think about it

536
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
Obviously Fox News. It wasn't cool because a dude resigned

537
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,992
Almost certainly would have been fired to try and put out the story

538
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Some more advertisers my bail

539
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Tucker's

540
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
You can just wait this out on another vacation and

541
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,256
Come back in a few weeks

542
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
He is almost certainly

543
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,936
Never shake the MyPillow

544
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
It cares

545
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Frankly anybody

546
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
There's other than people who are like

547
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
We're way past this man

548
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
We already knew that he was racist

549
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
Justin Bieber

550
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,928
If you work on Tucker's there's a good chance

551
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Camera guy like listening if you're

552
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,936
The gist

553
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
That'd be tough

554
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
I don't know though like

555
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
Trying to compare this to like when I worked at a roast beef place

556
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Food is kind of gross

557
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
But I still work there

558
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
True

559
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Now that's true roast beef

560
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Roast beef

561
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
Pretty cool

562
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
In terms of that

563
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,304
Super weird was

564
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
Now you're talking about how you need to

565
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
New course is part of a sales pitch

566
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
Really weird about is iodine

567
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
I mean

568
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
We've heard stuff like this

569
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
Before but I just want to keep this in just

570
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
Little marker on that guy

571
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Battlefield

572
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
3 the good

573
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Station in the US

574
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
2 billion people

575
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Mental disabilities or lower IQ

576
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Because it is going to buy it or not getting it

577
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
60 ambrosia

578
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
The key

579
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Adrenochrome

580
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
He's going to like you

581
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,776
All into the adrenochrome Stop

582
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
They have

583
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
So

584
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
I would give him I would give him

585
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:54,016
What was the early 2017 Eddie Bravo

586
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
The elite sprinkler adrenochrome

587
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,184
Actually predate a lot of the Cuban on people who might want to try and reach

588
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Claim that from them

589
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
Adrenochrome prolong

590
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
It's been a while

591
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Anyway I just think it's funny

592
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Parrot 2

593
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
It does seem

594
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Defeat your

595
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
Your purpose

596
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Pretty awesome

597
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
You can get really high on to iodine

598
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Know about iodine

599
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
If it's busy

600
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Nascent

601
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,192
Alex Alex

602
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
Last episode

603
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
And I see some

604
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,272
I'm upsetting headlines about

605
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,832
Releasing some opposition research

606
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,440
Executive branch

607
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,560
Because we played cliff on the episode of Alex

608
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Credit for

609
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
Fauci being on the outs

610
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Yeah we were recording that

611
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
We were not aware of that at all

612
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Just thrilled

613
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
Of course we talked about that a little bit more

614
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
All the time

615
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Fauci

616
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Has been

617
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Wrong

618
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
On

619
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Coronavirus

620
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,656
They're so upset and so mad that he won't even keep score

621
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Expert

622
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
Call Coach that lost every play

623
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,848
Every game ever put one point on the board

624
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
I think I can't get my head around right now is why Trump is dozen

625
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Fire fauci

626
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,832
Like what could possibly be stopping him from firing the dude

627
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
East

628
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,048
Absolutely no cuz I have no idea what's going on

629
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Accountable

630
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,240
Might be in gation of like how dictators operate when they're not sure in their footing

631
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,616
I don't care about this dumb f*** political posturing in the middle of a pandemic

632
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,992
There's no time for stuff like this in a mature World directly rejected

633
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
I'll take Alex seriously by keeping score as soon as he applied the same standards

634
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
He's insisting for fauci on to

635
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Trump and himself

636
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,000
This kind of childish lashing out doesn't rise to the level in my eyes of like

637
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Deserving attention

638
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
Nope and I mostly only keeping this

639
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
And the next play.

640
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Kind of to be like

641
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,264
I certainly hope this doesn't look really really terrible in a couple months

642
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Code word

643
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
T understood what was happening and

644
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
Was going to build a case

645
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Kanzashi

646
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
Go that way

647
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
Go get somebody close before he destroys them but

648
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,008
So Alex is taking responsibility for feeding the information to Trump to get fauci on the outs

649
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:32,384
And he's insisting the Trump is communicating with secret code using the word sideline

650
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
So

651
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,712
Great truck also placed an ad

652
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
In the Austin States

653
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,320
That only Alex knows how to read if you it's

654
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
It's not an acrostic but it

655
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Is every eight

656
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
The second letter of every 8th word is how

657
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
Alex gets his messages and this last one

658
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
The great job

659
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Okay

660
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
So Alex

661
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Discussing

662
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Virus stop being a hoax

663
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,456
I wanted a big big headlines on this is it there was a guy who is a correspondent for like

664
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
NBC MSNBC

665
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
And it had Coronavirus

666
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
Do you believe that

667
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,184
And turns out

668
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
He ends up getting an antibody test

669
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
He comes back negative

670
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,584
So Alex believes this is Bruce

671
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
But I was enough

672
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Put me in the ICU for

673
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Infowars.com nbcnews

674
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
He tested neg

675
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,296
Which means he hasn't had a cold or the flu in 10 years on average

676
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
I didn't show up

677
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Unbelievable

678
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,744
What that means

679
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,680
It's really confusing because the clip Alex plays it's just that guy dr. Joseph Fair

680
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,776
Explain really sick and it's underlined condition

681
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
In reality I was kind of just fudging the story

682
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
In Mayfair got really sick

683
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
You had basically all of the symptoms that are associated with covid-19

684
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
19

685
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,904
You got some nasal swab test some of them at home and then came back

686
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,280
Because he was presenting as a very likely covid case and there's a possibility of false negative

687
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,192
A couple months later after he's made a recovery Fair got an antibody test

688
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Who came back

689
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
This presents a number of possible scenarios that could be going on here

690
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,176
The first is that he had an unknown condition that was very similar in progression of symptoms

691
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
Covid-19

692
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Leaving this a medical mystery That Remains

693
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Basalt

694
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
It's also possible that the nasal swab she took were false negative

695
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Could be accurate

696
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,280
This would mean that he did have covid-19 but he doesn't have antibodies

697
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
I would show up in a test for them patties

698
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Inconceivably pasa

699
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
As of this point it's unclear exactly what's up here

700
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
He said he's Consulting more doctors

701
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
Trying to get to the bottom of what happened

702
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
You seem additional expert

703
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
Follow up antibody test

704
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
He'll be able to

705
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
Get to the bottom of what happened

706
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
The scenario that I think is most unlikely and all this is what Alex's suggest

707
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,160
Namely the doctor Fair

708
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,744
You really had faked everything

709
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,584
Why would he then revealed that he tested negative for the antibody test

710
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
It's not like his doctor could even legal you release that information

711
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Himself

712
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Is this was all staged

713
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Why would you do that

714
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
That makes no sense

715
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Most terrified

716
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Prosper

717
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
Possibility

718
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
Is 1 minutes

719
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
Becoming more and more

720
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,808
Researched and there's more and more evidence

721
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
For it is that

722
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
The antibodies go away you

723
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
You don't have permanent immunity to

724
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
That could be a factor in their zaxxon

725
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Terrified

726
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
Plays a role in this story

727
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
We'll check back in on it

728
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,544
He's not like a cardboard cutout

729
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,128
Volkswagen

730
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,760
For a while you presume

731
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Some sort of an indication that baby

732
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
You didn't

733
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,976
You know that's kind of even scarier

734
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Could be a chronic condition of some kind

735
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
You know there's a lot

736
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,632
Pretty scary so I would assume

737
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
Continue trying to figure out what's going on

738
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
If only for his own

739
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,336
How many times have you heard

740
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Like the moment I got my diagnosis

741
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
Thank God there's a reason and I understand

742
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
To then if it was then ripped away from

743
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
4 minutes

744
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,416
We have no f****** clue what's wrong with you that would be

745
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Terrifying and it's

746
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
Yeah I kind of scared

747
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
When I was younger

748
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,376
As a as a teen

749
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Almost

750
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,336
Just have to give you this and everything

751
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Am I hope today

752
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
But

753
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Jordan

754
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
To the point

755
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Episode

756
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
We can wait

757
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
40K

758
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
Rodger Stone

759
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Is not here

760
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,768
Get back to the Wayfarer

761
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,120
You wanted to talk a little bit more about his audience

762
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,192
He's really warming up to this

763
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
I saw this Wayfair Thing by Friday

764
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Online yoga

765
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Bender

766
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Psych

767
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Competition to Amazon

768
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Was so rude

769
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Killer

770
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,623
Hundred-dollar $200 tablets

771
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,183
For 10,000 13014

772
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,743
15016 $17,000

773
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,839
Pillows that were maybe thirty bucks for $5,000

774
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
With in some cases the names

775
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Missing children on

776
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,591
Ghislaine Maxwell

777
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
Almost

778
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
Really

779
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Money laundering

780
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
The symbol of

781
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
Deliver this child

782
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,351
Wasn't somebody adding more zeros on steak

783
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
So apparently the money-laundering office

784
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Open was also about

785
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Sewing kit

786
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Yeah traffic

787
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
People

788
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Great

789
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Worried

790
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
Wayfair

791
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
Write for Alex

792
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,295
Short descent

793
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,879
Get sued

794
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,439
I worried for the Seco just like what it is

795
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
Just as a case study of

796
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Should know better

797
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,607
You know you would think I would even discussing something last episode but like

798
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Alex did have to give

799
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,495
A gigantic apology to James Oliphant

800
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,567
We had to do that or else he's going to get food

801
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,943
It made for a lot of trouble Biggs pizzagate coverage

802
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
He ended up

803
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Spending

804
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,575
Months and months trying to pretend that he didn't do pizzagate

805
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,159
Deleted from YouTube

806
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
Like you don't need to do this you can take

807
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
Pass on the way to Fairbanks

808
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,095
It's not going to stick around for a very long time

809
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,679
Just some dumb qanon bulshit

810
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,727
And then they'll move on to the next thing

811
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
I will tell you I think there is one

812
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Case study that I can

813
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Recall

814
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
That reminds me very

815
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
And it's the case study of one wild e

816
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
Coyote

817
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Nope just

818
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:12,671
Can't learn their other things to eat in that desert I get it there's it looked at the roadrunner

819
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
There's other stuff out there

820
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
So apparently Alex that had somebody sent him

821
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
Some stuff on Amazon and this changed

822
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Does not matter

823
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Partially

824
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
What's going on

825
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
I hate you

826
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Show you some of this

827
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
Took hours ago wrong but I'll try my best

828
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
All these other big shopping

829
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
Amazon

830
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,855
Going back years have the exact same code words

831
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Turns out that

832
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:50,047
Got caught with prostitution in similar things

833
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Years ago

834
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
I don't know others

835
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Destino

836
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
Similar stuff on Amazon

837
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,031
Going on for a long time that nobody

838
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Noticed

839
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Different

840
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Hahaha

841
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Specifics the week

842
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Assertive

843
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
Nail into

844
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
Wayfair

845
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Amazon

846
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Pillows

847
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Thousand dollars

848
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
And then it starts

849
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,095
Telling normally sold for $20

850
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,679
The names of going to show you all of those folks

851
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Some of this

852
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Babies

853
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
Shriveled like they're starving to death

854
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Weird comment

855
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Code word

856
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Boston helicopter

857
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Starch

858
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,695
So the reviews that Alex is talking about there at the end

859
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,863
There's an entire subculture of people who write fake reviews for things on Amazon

860
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
What's going on here

861
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
Very funny

862
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,263
Pictures of emaciated kids on Amazon

863
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:09,407
Talking about weirdos found on searching for the SKU numbers for these product

864
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
It's in a very specific

865
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Place

866
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
The SKU for a product is the stock keeping unit number

867
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Retailers use to track inventory

868
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
As it turns out if you take

869
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
SKU numbers for these suspicious item

870
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,023
C-usa

871
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,839
And then you search for that in the Russian search engine

872
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Demdex

873
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
You come up with some

874
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Questionable image results

875
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Some of them are children

876
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,615
Are you people doing Yandex searches

877
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,687
Character research myself already got the

878
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
To the bottom of it

879
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,319
The account Dapper Gander on Twitter has a great thread fully explaining what's going on

880
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
What y'all some up yours best

881
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
There is a Russian image

882
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
It's called imgsrc

883
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Should definitely not go

884
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,399
It was essentially formally like Photobucket but sent that early is 20/40

885
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
It's been taken over by pedophiles

886
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Zuko's Demopolis

887
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,311
American search engines filter out results that come from this Russia

888
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Maturing

889
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
Because of the high incidence of illegal images that would come up in the results

890
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,223
Does not exist

891
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
Search engine

892
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
Which is why qanon weirdos

893
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
Insist on using search engine

894
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
In order to prove their conspiracy

895
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,207
Basically if you search for SRC along with just about a

896
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,559
Anything on Yandex very high likelihood of finding some at least questionable picture

897
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
So what's boils down to is basically a scam

898
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
It's a trap

899
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
In terms of swimming hours

900
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
Falling for this

901
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Babe

902
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,151
The master of research in reality got filled by a Fool's task qanon

903
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,943
I don't like

904
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Bad faith

905
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Use monsters to

906
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
To portray

907
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Good faith actors

908
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
Is monsters while bad faith actors

909
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
Continue the entire cycle

910
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
Over and over and over again

911
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Without doing

912
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
You know

913
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
Realized

914
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
You was wrong

915
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Good

916
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
2018

917
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
2019

918
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
Jones cannot believe

919
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
This is just

920
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
LOL

921
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,391
So Alex

922
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Let's go ahead

923
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,583
And let's see if he runs a right on into that rock

924
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,335
In case you wanted not really commit to this baby

925
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,991
Well unfortunately

926
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
Explicitly

927
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
This is not a psyop

928
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
Disco song August is no mistake

929
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
Oh my God

930
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
Product code for you right there with Rebecca Moore

931
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,239
So I don't think you could be much clearer than that

932
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
Wow really

933
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
If up this doesn't turn out poorly and more embarrassing way after they give us another apology for CEO of Wayfair whatever

934
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
I don't know

935
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,463
We come back here on the 13th

936
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Wayfair

937
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,607
So this episode on the 13th

938
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
Is like okay

939
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
Rodger didn't show up on

940
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Sunday

941
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Right baby you still

942
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,919
Monday you've got to be the one hundred percent

943
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
Has to be there

944
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
You does not

945
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
Dammit

946
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
No Rodger

947
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Apologize

948
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,927
Us

949
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:10,303
For years to tell him

950
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,143
Directions to push it

951
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:21,823
The days overdue hey Rodger what's going on with you

952
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
And talk about this

953
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
Is Indiana story a little bit more

954
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
And then I'm going to show you the footage

955
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Newscast

956
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,367
About the white woman shot today

957
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,439
12

958
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
Enter some

959
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,815
Dwayne criminal mentally ill

960
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Vicious small minority

961
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Black folks

962
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Going out

963
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,711
This is all going on

964
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
And the media

965
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Is all

966
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Busy covering it

967
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
So there's a cover-up

968
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,927
The media of black males

969
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,791
Between 13 and 25 or out to kill and knockout game

970
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:18,399
White people

971
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,959
In American history that would almost

972
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Primarily Focus

973
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Tucson 13

974
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
Twenty-five-year-old blackmails is being evil

975
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,895
I certainly don't feel like this has any

976
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
Historical

977
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:35,039
Sustained

978
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,647
30000 seasons of Law & Order's in their various spin-offs

979
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
So Alex

980
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,511
To talk in here

981
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Alex

982
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Appears to be the

983
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Okay

984
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,751
You would think that if you didn't

985
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
Right there's one that's kind of important

986
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,871
And that is

987
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
No black person who is alive

988
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,991
The subject of more racism

989
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,343
Simself

990
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,183
Dallas Texas

991
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,255
Thought I was crazy

992
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Call Sasha

993
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
Andy Black

994
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
I mean I probably have

995
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
And you know I

996
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,447
And then his brother was a prison

997
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
So

998
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Black people out there that

999
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:10,783
That have

1000
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,599
Ever had 100 white people start fights

1001
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
Presented without comment

1002
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
1

1003
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,279
10 u.s. Representatives

1004
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,863
You're something I I I want to say just heard of axiomatic

1005
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,215
If you have gotten in 100 fights in your life

1006
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Haha that's about you

1007
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
Because most people don't know

1008
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
150

1009
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:42,527
It's more about you than just about anybody else

1010
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
There's a hundred incidents that

1011
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,695
Commonality between always 100 lights

1012
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Race

1013
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,791
That's the second thing

1014
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,839
100 fights with

1015
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,375
Black people

1016
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:04,543
That's the secondary element that makes it even more about you

1017
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Flat number 6

1018
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:10,175
I think maybe his perspective and perception that

1019
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,015
Might be a little bit

1020
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,807
How do you spell

1021
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
It's very hot

1022
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Sports with a

1023
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,695
El Paso

1024
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:28,607
Have you heard of the John Birch Society

1025
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,655
Learn about the hair

1026
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,519
Yeah man I don't know

1027
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:40,639
I can't parse any of that stuff actually really necessarily believe his numbers are accurate

1028
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
But if you're getting in a lot of fights

1029
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,831
Something about you other people responding to you

1030
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
I believe

1031
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
If you're saying it like that

1032
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
You already

1033
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,095
So Alex is coverage in Indianapolis

1034
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
Trend of

1035
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,959
Trying to make people afraid of

1036
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,287
If people are yelling blacklivesmatter at you then

1037
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,687
Yes

1038
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
How to kill white people for fun

1039
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
It's all just that there's just

1040
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,063
The building of it is sort of race

1041
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Race-based

1042
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
Beer that Alex wants to

1043
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
Still course Avatar who did it

1044
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
And the boys are overwhelmed and it's not

1045
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Starfall

1046
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,535
If you just saw that

1047
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
Dawson's not safe

1048
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,911
Not safe there's murders all the time

1049
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,471
Robin stabbing shooting most of its racial

1050
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
Nothing is going to be down about

1051
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,335
These areas are not safe

1052
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
Don't let anybody lie to you

1053
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,711
Any left the city is not safe

1054
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Because

1055
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Control

1056
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
Has been lost

1057
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,439
So control has been lost in the left-leaning areas

1058
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
And the specifics

1059
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,095
He seems to be operating off of our various places where there is a lot of

1060
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,887
Shooting

1061
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
And they're almost all racially-based

1062
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
These places

1063
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,311
It's not so much that they're not say

1064
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:19,455
G-strings

1065
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,503
I will say this

1066
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
If you are

1067
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
Thinking about leaving

1068
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Chicago

1069
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Two left

1070
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
Just for you

1071
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Get on out of

1072
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Get off

1073
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
Go to the forest

1074
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Stop get out of here

1075
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:38,655
Have a great time enough for any sort of politics

1076
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
But I do want to go to the

1077
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,775
That's different. I just want to commune with trees

1078
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:50,687
Alex discusses Chick-fil-A

1079
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Capitulate

1080
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
Everyone

1081
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Colitas now everything

1082
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,975
There's no future Chick-fil-A's business doubled in one year

1083
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
Close on Sunday

1084
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Hobby Lobby did the same thing today

1085
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,471
We push our religion on you but we are off on Sunday Christian

1086
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,263
Is that what they said though

1087
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
Today anyways

1088
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,943
Chick-fil-A

1089
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:31,391
Probably a black child

1090
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,511
Chick-fil-A in Hobby Lobby closed on Sundays

1091
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
The Sunday thing

1092
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:42,911
Close on Sundays or even on weekends

1093
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,215
No one cares

1094
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,359
Chick-fil-A anti-lgbtq

1095
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
There's been CEO Dan Cathy

1096
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:59,039
He said in 2012 that allowing same-sex marriage would quote invite

1097
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
These comments naturally got some book unhappy

1098
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,255
Responsible anti-lgbtq forces on the right-wing turn Chick-fil-A into a pillar of their identity

1099
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
That was the chicken company that

1100
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,327
Fought for their interest

1101
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
Mike Huckabee tried to get a Chick-fil-A appreciation day going

1102
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,727
It sort of became a way of engaging and homophobic

1103
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Trolling

1104
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,055
People wanted to publicly expressive distain for LG

1105
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
G b t q people directly

1106
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
Big deal out of supporting chick

1107
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Chick-fil-A

1108
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:32,831
I was almost like they were stoked because they're like

1109
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,671
Chicken sandwich

1110
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,511
In the process of this whole conversation it came out that the Kathy's had given million

1111
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Games to anti-gay org

1112
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
Innovations including ones that promoted conversion therapy

1113
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
Business with people that a problem

1114
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,495
Chick-fil-A

1115
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Anymore

1116
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,479
Pissed off but are you sure it wasn't because we all

1117
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
Just assumed that if they were open on Sunday they would

1118
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
I'm pretty sure that's what we were

1119
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,791
Hobby Lobby

1120
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,887
Included birth control

1121
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
And they did that

1122
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:24,287
Cuz they don't want to force their religion on

1123
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,383
People judge a business eventually deciding how to treat their employees based on a religious

1124
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,151
Just believe

1125
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:37,087
2017

1126
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:42,463
$3000000 settlement

1127
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
To put in his collection of Bible memorabilia

1128
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:49,631
According to MSNBC Hobby Lobby hired an expert

1129
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:00,127
Instead according to the justice department 5,500 artifact

1130
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
Without proper documentation

1131
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
Themes

1132
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,247
Very bad

1133
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:10,111
Hobby Lobby going to stay open

1134
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:16,767
Because Green's wife Barbara had received a message from God saying that everything was cool

1135
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,095
But they're not going to force their religion on it

1136
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,703
Ended up closing all their stores in April

1137
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,543
No one cares about these businesses being closed on Sunday

1138
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:33,663
The problem isn't destructive Behavior

1139
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,455
Rich people shouldn't be allowed to engage in

1140
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
It seems like

1141
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Keno's

1142
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,903
That's why people were mad

1143
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Sunday

1144
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Because of supporting things like

1145
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
Conversion therapy

1146
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Open

1147
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,607
Right

1148
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,655
Affordable Care Act

1149
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:01,311
Honestly all time honored American tradition

1150
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
Just not on today

1151
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
But

1152
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
I'll talk to Rodger Stone today

1153
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
I'm just going to leave it at that

1154
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
He'll be here tomorrow

1155
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Yes

1156
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,887
But he's not yet there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes

1157
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Sad

1158
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,823
If he's on Hannity

1159
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
Be too busy to you to go on Hannity

1160
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,647
Sort of curious about where Alex stands on the 5G stop it

1161
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,743
And Coronavirus

1162
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,119
Necessarily

1163
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
However

1164
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,007
It turns out the water might be muddy or than we think

1165
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
People point out to be 3 months ago

1166
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:11,455
Years ago he showed documents were 5G in China

1167
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
What's causing an autoimmune response in the lungs

1168
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
People think they were dying

1169
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,695
Call group of talk to you so I won't come on I love you brother

1170
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Elektra really bad

1171
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Time

1172
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
But he

1173
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,471
This electromagnetic radiation

1174
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
The system is getting so powerful

1175
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
That that that

1176
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,639
Autoimmune response

1177
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
It's really exacerbating

1178
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,855
First things first

1179
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,903
Exacerbating the condition that people are having

1180
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
He said there's no virus

1181
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
Which is a different claim

1182
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,191
Discovering this is a byproduct

1183
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
Spectre group discover

1184
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:11,103
If this is just a 5G thing then what happened to the stories about the

1185
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,735
Timelab just take a second to think about you

1186
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,135
Creating a virus as a bioweapon

1187
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
Completely Superfluous or it has to be readjusted to now actually be about them researching a specific virus at work

1188
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,679
Which hasn't been demonstrated up to this point everything needs to change to accommodate this

1189
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
He said

1190
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:50,783
I guess this is what we're doing then

1191
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,367
All right you will you're going to ignore this tomorrow

1192
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,719
Completely forgot this was actually all

1193
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
Created in the Wuhan lab before

1194
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:06,655
Didn't exist right now

1195
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
5G mansion

1196
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
They're still best

1197
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
Text Rodger

1198
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,807
Explains a little bit about why Rodger

1199
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,831
Isn't around

1200
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,647
There's a reason that are Rodger Dunn on this show Yeti

1201
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Tomorrow

1202
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
My email

1203
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,303
OU mice

1204
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
Commutation order

1205
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,103
So he still under her jurisdiction

1206
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,807
So here's where things get a little messy for Alex and Rodger

1207
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,439
It looks like Trump put out a press release an announcement that Rodger sentence was commuted

1208
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:07,071
Clemency but it looks like he didn't actually provide the appropriate information to the judge and Rogers case

1209
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
Just causing a little bit of an issue

1210
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,423
According to an article in time

1211
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,775
Although president prison sentences

1212
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:22,175
The brief order from Jackson who presided over Stones trial last year made clear that the judge still is seeking information

1213
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
About the clemency

1214
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,295
Including the actual executive order from the White House

1215
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,623
Has not been provided this is 100%

1216
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:37,023
Like this is f****** Lethal Weapon this is like all you're a loose cannon he's doing all the chance I know he's real

1217
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
If you still have to do the f***

1218
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
Paperwork

1219
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
There's some issues here

1220
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,519
Possibly be what's keeping Rodger from coming on Infowars

1221
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,823
Maybe that's the excuse Rogers giving

1222
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,175
But Rodgers and he's not afraid to speak out

1223
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
On Monday Rodger appeared on Sean Hannity's exclusive

1224
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:04,671
First interview since the commutation of his possibilities

1225
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
Not hold back

1226
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,791
You was talking s*** about the judge and the prosecution all over

1227
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
The place

1228
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,375
The only reason Rodger isn't on Alex's show

1229
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
Nowadays after the commutation

1230
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Is because Rodgers

1231
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
Choosing not to come on

1232
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,847
Maybe it's because he knows better or maybe it's just a thing where he agreed not to appear anywhere beforehand

1233
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
In return for that

1234
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,479
It's hard to know exactly what's up

1235
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,807
Alex is not a high priority for Rodger anymore

1236
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
Alex threw him

1237
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,207
Clemency celebration party on Alex's

1238
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,047
Alex said Rodger was going to be on the show on Sunday and he didn't show up

1239
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:45,887
Now on Monday Alex claims that he has some kind of inside baseball stuff

1240
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,679
Keeping Rodger from coming on

1241
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:51,263
He's totally fine being on the same the same day

1242
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
This is pathetic

1243
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
Just grow up and recognize this dude doesn't give a f***

1244
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,431
You're not useful anymore

1245
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
I didn't see any of it cuz I was trying to avoid it in case we wound up

1246
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
Play eclipse of the interviewer any

1247
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,111
I was thinking about it but

1248
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
The one thing I did

1249
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,207
He did thank

1250
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
And there was multiple

1251
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
For people that

1252
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Was listed

1253
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
In the article

1254
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
Strikingly

1255
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,191
Is that right

1256
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,615
That would have been included in the article very highly

1257
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Right

1258
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,783
Maybe if it still goes

1259
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:41,695
Stonebanks Alex Jones what grade is it

1260
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,607
Forget the name

1261
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,399
Robin.

1262
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
So Alex doesn't have Rodger

1263
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
For the second and third hour

1264
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,967
Not good cause

1265
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:09,343
He does get one call where they discuss the voter fraud and how it's going to be big problem

1266
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,671
What's brings up

1267
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,951
Sir

1268
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
The musical

1269
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,351
Balance in the male cats are getting voter registration

1270
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,423
They're just scraping all names they know of legal

1271
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
Illegal dead you name it

1272
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,775
Angelica about the key addresses of Democrats

1273
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,079
Is a fun story and all but a cat

1274
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,383
Didn't get a ballot in the mail

1275
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:37,759
Voter registration application in the mail

1276
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
The dead for twelve years

1277
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,111
There's a number of possibilities for what could be going on here

1278
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,671
What is it is cat's name

1279
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
Some kind of registration

1280
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,095
And someone scraping list for voter registration drives

1281
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
The cat was a person

1282
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,263
This is plausible considering the cat's name was Cody which could easily be mistaken for a human name

1283
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Peace out on the list

1284
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,311
If it were mr. fluffy

1285
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,895
Automated

1286
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:08,223
Are cats or dogs

1287
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Whose name

1288
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:16,159
Orders that they get from like petrified stores and stuff like that

1289
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,183
Could be made

1290
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,279
Registration Drive

1291
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,519
It's a viral story The People recovering because it's Flash

1292
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,871
Who knows

1293
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,503
First thought that I've I'm having right now is

1294
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,159
12 years ago 2008 that's when the internet started getting like

1295
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Everybody

1296
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Everybody was on

1297
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,607
Okay the point where you were signing up for stuff over and over and over you were signing up for so many different things

1298
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:00,959
Surprised

1299
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,007
Use my real name for this

1300
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
I'll just use my

1301
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,431
Possibility

1302
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,247
Whatever happened

1303
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,551
Register to vote

1304
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,879
Is it guy wanted to commit voter fraud

1305
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,183
Successfully sent into voter registration forms

1306
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Since the cat wouldn't have any

1307
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,487
Human ID or Wrecker

1308
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:26,815
There's no way that this could have resulted in an illegal vote

1309
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,423
Also if the globalist evil plan is to send out ballots in the names of dead cats

1310
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,751
The owners of these

1311
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
The plant

1312
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,919
Really stupid

1313
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Talk about it

1314
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:49,343
If you were going to do voter fraud particularly on a large-scale this is the last way you would ever do it

1315
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,135
Best way would be to register

1316
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
People through Wayfair

1317
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Everyone knows

1318
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,743
WinCo

1319
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
Conspiracy shop

1320
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
Now this

1321
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
So

1322
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
Listcawler

1323
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,471
She's confronting Alex

1324
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,287
About him saying something about Michael Jack

1325
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
So what happened

1326
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
2020

1327
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Correct

1328
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:17,247
Alex was talking about everybody

1329
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
Some topics

1330
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,415
You remember Michael Jackson and kids wore masks

1331
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Send stuff

1332
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Appreciate

1333
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
Really interested

1334
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
I'm sticking up for Michael Jack

1335
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Events

1336
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
Second

1337
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:44,127
Because it reveals how Alex responds when he's confronted about something

1338
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
He doesn't give a s***

1339
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:50,783
I do understand it was just strange how you went from that into Michael Jackson he was in a party

1340
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,999
This will quickly become one child over the balcony that was his

1341
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,327
He didn't give us children wine and

1342
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
Something else you said he died

1343
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
Prince died of

1344
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,031
Whatever man

1345
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,383
With the network more Christian weekly or Christian Christian to Born Again

1346
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:22,271
We got we got to be we got to be well I mean

1347
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Pharmacist

1348
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,879
I remember he was a whole bunch.

1349
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,159
The same thing as Prince

1350
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
Thought it was Fentanyl

1351
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
Greater than

1352
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,303
Valium and they got

1353
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
Do I go off on Michael Jackson all day long.

1354
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,527
Not mostly Brian stelter

1355
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
What are we doing

1356
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,623
I don't know if it's

1357
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,159
Interesting

1358
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:03,999
Color is bringing up like concrete things that Alex was written about

1359
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
I don't care

1360
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,583
You're not a pharmacist

1361
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
We have to be a cure

1362
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,055
Can you see the distain Alex has for someone bringing up

1363
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,103
Like concrete misrepresentation

1364
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Doesn't care

1365
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,503
A title resigned to the idea that someone would

1366
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,439
It's exactly how I would expect him to respond

1367
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:39,839
I said

1368
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:44,703
Cubeatz

1369
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,127
Sprite use your facts I'm going to say the same s*** tomorrow at

1370
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,687
Dangerous

1371
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
It's just straight-up telling his audience not to get test

1372
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Did ferko

1373
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,623
You know they're going to mess with folks that have erected

1374
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
Well from it

1375
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,719
Show me some new special DNA vaccine

1376
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
Never have a job again

1377
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
You don't want to be tested

1378
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,375
You don't want to be on record having this

1379
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Oh yeah yeah exactly

1380
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,239
That's good that's a dangerous mentality

1381
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
You don't want to be pet

1382
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
Do you want to be tested

1383
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,871
Zendaya give you a false positive

1384
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,407
And then use that to

1385
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,199
The news

1386
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
Dangerous man

1387
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,527
This is

1388
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
This is

1389
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,367
The only thing that makes me think that virus

1390
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,415
Has its own consciousness

1391
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
Can afford to hire

1392
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
Exactly what you

1393
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Good kush

1394
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,655
If you were

1395
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
Things to get worse

1396
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,983
Totally know 100%

1397
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
It's it's

1398
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,639
Don't you feel sick with the last thing you should do is know whether you're sick or not

1399
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:05,599
When should be like hey you everybody should get tested so then we can prove with all of our test

1400
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:11,743
No cuz Alex thinks of the testers give you false positive

1401
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:15,327
Covid-19

1402
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
Save it

1403
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
He thinks that

1404
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
What you saying

1405
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
I can't believe anybody

1406
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,967
Vaguely racist comments

1407
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Just boring

1408
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,111
It's towards the end of the show now and he's getting really introspective

1409
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
Defensive

1410
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
About

1411
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
Some people

1412
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
These calls are fake

1413
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
News articles out there

1414
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Hey are those fake caller ID

1415
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,239
As if I have time and energy to fake stuff

1416
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,799
Is it all completely real

1417
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,127
So used to fraud

1418
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,663
I don't know something real

1419
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
When they're sick

1420
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
What's going on

1421
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
So call in sometime

1422
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,023
Experience it for yourself it's real you'll be on are real things are happening this is a real word

1423
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,119
I used to think there was a good chance that Alex's callers could be fake

1424
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,167
Possibility

1425
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,239
Appliance

1426
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:31,359
The reason is because there's so many of the same callers are calling over and over

1427
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
For themselves

1428
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,199
There's a guy named Carlos

1429
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:39,039
Two calls in pretty much every show and Alex is Alex

1430
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Looks like it's just like

1431
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
I don't know what

1432
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
What's going on

1433
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,159
Just let them talk for like 10 minutes

1434
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:50,815
There's also a guy named Chase the Patriot and calls him pretty much every day and he's at least partially doing it to promote his own YouTube

1435
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,583
Channel

1436
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,423
So there are some real people but I think some of them might have their own agendas mixed in

1437
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,983
Regular callers on Alex's show

1438
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,847
That's at the reason I pulled back because Alex the saying that he's trying to tell the truth

1439
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,895
And trying to figure out what's going on

1440
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,943
I'm super offended by that

1441
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,503
Because he doesn't even do the least you could do

1442
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
To figure out what's going on

1443
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,951
I tuned into the show and the headline story about the article that headline is from

1444
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
No way matches with the actual article says

1445
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,095
Which strongly implies that Alex hasn't even taken the time to read the

1446
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
Cozy cover

1447
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:31,007
He said as much many times in the past when it like a stack of paper on his desk and he'll say I've read some of these articles

1448
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:36,895
We recently found the clip with him talking about how we even read all of Carol Quigley's book tragedy

1449
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,199
We just supposed to be the foundation of his world

1450
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
The blueprints of the globalist plan

1451
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,087
Alex is not trying to figure out what's going on because he doesn't even do the

1452
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Easiest Bank

1453
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,623
He could do

1454
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
We just read the stories he's covering on air

1455
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
Because I know that's the case

1456
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
Becomes clear the other thing

1457
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,839
But he's trying to tell the truth isn't true

1458
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,143
He's a lying about trying to tell the truth

1459
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:03,519
Just just an absolute liar doesn't have the time or energy to fee

1460
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Because that sounds like it

1461
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,359
The effort and that is not something he's very

1462
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,967
Yeah and what he tries to do these like set-pieces they fall apart so I can

1463
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,063
If you was intentionally trying to

1464
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Fake something Grand

1465
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,183
I don't think you could keep up

1466
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
A bit with a fake call

1467
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
Sales at Moore

1468
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,839
Is regular job

1469
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
Tries to do a

1470
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,751
He can improvise something made up all day long

1471
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,311
When there's another person involved

1472
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Not good

1473
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,383
Weather at night

1474
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,919
Whenever they try and do bits

1475
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,199
The disaster

1476
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,503
If you was trying to do that with a collar it would just

1477
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,295
Fall Apart

1478
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,623
He could make up thing all day

1479
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
I forgot to do the news

1480
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,655
The oldest coronavirus news

1481
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:06,751
Call so much but I'm out of time won't take your calls or just one taste a lot

1482
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
The 4th hour

1483
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,967
Any over into Gerald Celente

1484
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Is big covid news

1485
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,575
Cuz he's going to take your phone call

1486
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Iceberg

1487
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:32,607
Forgot to Coronavirus

1488
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:39,007
Broadcasting is election Night results

1489
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
We have taken

1490
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:48,735
Normal boilerplate nonsense about coronavirus

1491
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
Big nose

1492
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:57,183
If you're going to commit to taking calls I appreciate that at least you're doing that no time for calls

1493
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,207
Mike Mike

1494
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,535
Consignment

1495
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,655
I'm just going to say this is the last day of the big sale

1496
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,360
Hey look I want to go to the big coronavirus news but I can't because I've got to go to cause I really want to go

1497
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
But I got a plug

1498
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,736
Maslow's hierarchy of Alex works

1499
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
Top priority

1500
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:38,912
Alright okay you missed it this time but another 20 down there are you got it the first few times you're doing great

1501
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,752
Alright okay so we missed it the second time alright but I'm going to have to get out of here

1502
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,544
Bye

1503
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,896
Wow I don't even know

1504
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,944
I get it you're strong cell shape

1505
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:55,040
I find this so amazing

1506
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,368
Looking in on this I know that there's not as much

1507
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
As I would like

1508
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:05,792
Something that would have just been beating a dead horse insurance is like his racism

1509
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Fairly races

1510
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Stop trial

1511
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
Put

1512
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
This is amazing

1513
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
2 days

1514
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
Is amazing

1515
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
41

1516
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,800
I can't express to you how shocked I am that Rodger.

1517
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
Didn't show up

1518
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,360
Like that to me is such

1519
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
Eject dance

1520
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
Sign of the time

1521
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:27,808
Alex has been one of the only people out there being like

1522
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,368
Yep free Rodger Stone

1523
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,184
On the line

1524
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,208
Pissed off

1525
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:39,584
Some of the money was being funneled to Rogers defense fun and stuff like that

1526
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
It's like

1527
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
On Monday

1528
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,424
It has been days

1529
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,984
Rodger has had every opportunity

1530
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
Call Lynn

1531
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
5 Second

1532
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
His failings that

1533
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,640
Record something in advance to send to Alex

1534
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:58,016
Dropped everything to pre-record something totally

1535
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,552
Rodger

1536
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
Is clearly not given Alex

1537
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,648
Time of day doesn't need him anymore

1538
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,928
That's f******

1539
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Nuts

1540
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,024
I will admit this Stone situation has

1541
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
I'm past

1542
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Weather.

1543
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
Justice system works

1544
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
Past that

1545
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,960
I find this now hilarious in a schadenfreude way that I

1546
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,752
I can't fully Express

1547
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:22,336
The way he's being in the way he's shiting Oliver Alex Minot

1548
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,384
That's shot

1549
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,432
Embroidery the highest

1550
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Do I have to

1551
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:33,600
To keep holding onto and I know maybe I'll look silly for this in hindsight is like I'm sure you'll be there on Tuesday

1552
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,440
I haven't been able to listen to schedule when we recorded episodes

1553
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,232
But I'm sure

1554
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
You have to be there on Tuesday

1555
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,072
I can see a very easy

1556
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,376
Exact an explanation for this

1557
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,984
Would never want to talk about and Rodger gave the exclusive to Hannity

1558
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:53,568
Alex's lower on the totem pole

1559
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,360
Places that are really actually

1560
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
You're not here

1561
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,064
I don't think Alex well

1562
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,416
That's fair that's a good point. The kind of guy who's like at you know you take your lumps

1563
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:15,584
That's got to be brutal for him

1564
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
It is Egypt

1565
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,032
And he celebrated with an exclusive on here

1566
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,312
What the f***

1567
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
Ace

1568
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,616
How good that Sheldon

1569
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:32,992
Friday but I bet he'll be on the show on Tuesday but now I mean

1570
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
It does

1571
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:39,136
Next episode

1572
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:45,536
I can't wait for him not to be there I want Rodger to completely cut ties

1573
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,168
Not since doctor houses

1574
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,032
Just I want that schadenfreude

1575
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,384
Michelin-starred second that I think is actually like

1576
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,408
Really shocking

1577
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
Is the Wayfair

1578
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,504
Like in the clear

1579
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Entirely

1580
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
On the 11th

1581
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,368
When he got in studio and did his

1582
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
Yeah

1583
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:22,656
If you have to you can say I didn't say it wasn't something worse case scenario

1584
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,472
But you still have the media wants to

1585
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:31,616
To try and say that I was on this b******* that was a Honey Trap

1586
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,640
Then

1587
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,456
On Sunday for no reason unforced error

1588
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
Just coming out

1589
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,552
This is absolutely what this is

1590
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
It's real

1591
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,416
So bizarre so bizarre

1592
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,720
I'm used to seeing

1593
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
The Democrat

1594
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Snatch

1595
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
Defeat from the Jaws

1596
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Victory

1597
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,096
And you watch Alex really

1598
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
Really Steppin s***

1599
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,800
Tactically it seems like a really stupid

1600
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,616
People should know that

1601
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,432
Because he explained decision

1602
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,504
Friday or Saturday

1603
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,576
More less

1604
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,368
So anyway

1605
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,952
Rogers on on Tuesday

1606
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
I will be never

1607
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:24,352
We'll find out

1608
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:41,248
You are a few if you could please

1609
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,184
Beautiful. As well

1610
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,976
Emilio Emilio on dzx

1611
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,000
Clark I'm Rodger

1612
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
Stones booking agent

1613
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,960
Alex
