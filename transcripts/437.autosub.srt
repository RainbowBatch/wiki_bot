1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge B B I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need MoneyGram

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,024
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
About Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,912

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Courtesy of my

9
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,480
Dragon Queen Chrissy Center

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Perfectly

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,648
She is not supposed to you

12
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
She will kill me

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Point out that black dragon Queen

14
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Made her life

15
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Infinitely

16
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Anaheim

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
I guess my right side for the week

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Are in a week

19
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
You both are screwing that up now

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,384
I'm in watching some videos of a guy convict

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Talk about life in prison

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
I was already not really

23
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
I really got glad that I don't have to know any of that stuff

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
You know they talking about how you clean a peanut butter jar and stuff

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
He's fascinating to watch him rip up newspaper and coils of water with

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,264
Well I'm glad I just got water

27
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,872
No don't get out yet

28
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
That is displayed by people in prison

29
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
Like you take away people's ability to do very simple thing

30
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:36,160
Like send a message a couple sales over

31
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Insanely elaborate ways to do it hardening toothpaste up to make a weight to throw

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
It's impressive

33
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:52,032
But also very depressing circumstances dictate kind of

34
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Sojourn

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
So first Michael

36
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,056
Next word

37
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
Very much

38
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,248
Next

39
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm a policy wonk

00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Therapy that goes Electric

41
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Thank you so much Brett

42
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:52,448
See obstructive thank you so much

43
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Heroin

44
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
Is freakishly large

45
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Thank you so much

46
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,519
Generosity

47
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
DirecTV local cheerleader

48
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
Sweet appreciate either very much

49
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,527
Steve Jordan before we get to be

50
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
I really been doing I've been really focusing on some like real meat

51
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Basic Celtic uninteresting ambitious selfie

52
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
No no

53
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,359
Lebanon block of ice melt

54
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:08,991
Okay that sounds Sparkling Waters

55
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Hell yeah

56
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,535
Girl fight

57
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,143
Real good nothing to get too excited about

58
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
I've gone with the Campfield

59
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,079
The soda called

60
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,711
That's kind of a Fresca

61
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
Play I Like it I've always enjoyed that

62
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Alright

63
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
Do we got the the line of 11 of those

64
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,791
They're better they're better than nothing crazy

65
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Yes it's nice it's been a little bit of time in this world of just like

66
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Normal

67
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Normal self

68
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Deep questions

69
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
And this is probably the year of the shelter's biggest

70
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Alright

71
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Would you

72
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
Revisit the ecstatic

73
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Seltzer's

74
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,391
You know what I mean or is that as well as any ecstatic Seltzer something that must exist

75
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
In its own time

76
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,791
Do you mean you mean the ones that I rated very highly

77
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Would you drink the lemoncello

78
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
As as just like a regular time because I wouldn't want to get tired of it but

79
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
On a regular basis

80
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
I think that there's some that I rated pretty highly that I have to be in the mood

81
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Matt is that like

82
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
I do give points for ingenuity

83
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,679
Creativity

84
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
No Doubt

85
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
Because there's little-to-no preparation that I need to do on that and I have not had the time

86
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Recently I have to move

87
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
And so I've been apartment hunting

88
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
And that's the pain under normal circumstances

89
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,007
What show more complicated now

90
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Frustration

91
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,807
Tons and tons of stuff

92
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
That's taking up my time

93
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
And so the thing will have to wait

94
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
When we can properly

95
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,327
Right but at the same time there is something important

96
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
What's going on

97
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,447
In the world of our Wacky Wednesday

98
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:14,847
He's going to have lasting consequences I think I actually am and it's the kind of thing that

99
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271
I was thinking about getting some music to play on this episode

100
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road

101
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,671
Some other song that has goodbye in it

102
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
No no one no one

103
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,375
We've done it before but I think we officially probably have to say goodbye

104
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,471
To our friends with Project Camelot

105
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Matter

106
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
Just the other day over project catalog

107
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
Be aware there was a big announcement

108
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
But you made

109
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Hi everyone

110
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Hi Carrie

111
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
We are going

112
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
And I

113
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Free plans

114
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Simple

115
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Ways to

116
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
And

117
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
What I like

118
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Like to say is

119
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Demonetized

120
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Solution

121
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Ends us we have Gary Cassidy taken project subscription model

122
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Kerry Cassidy

123
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,519
You I think that's the actual and the road is covering her.

124
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,639
41 there's absolutely no chance that anybody on her God sent

125
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,759
Feel-Rite to do episodes going over things that creators keep behind a paywall

126
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,647
Yeah it's stupid but I still respect carries right their intellectual property

127
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
If she wants to try to get people to pay for access to her videos of me to pay for a membership than we brought

128
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
Podcast most of her videos on our own show

129
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
That's kind of unethical

130
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,823
Cersei is going to subscription model than just based on understanding of

131
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,175
What I think the limitations of fair use our I don't think we can do episodes about him

132
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
It's very frustrating that I

133
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
Pictures of bad

134
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Corset

135
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
A lot of respect

136
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
Compare when they're bad I don't really care

137
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Thoroughly

138
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
Looks like where we park you know

139
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
I'm not the only one

140
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,639
The YouTube announcement appears that the response is pretty divided

141
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Some people saying that they're going to come along with the new model

142
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Another saying they aren't going

143
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
There's a lot of people who are having their videos demonetized on YouTube right now

144
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
And so a lot of folks are trying to migrate to subscription model

145
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
Look in the comments is a ton of people who like I get

146
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
Buy content from XYZ different people and I'm not going to be able to afford to pay all of them

147
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Whatever

148
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,431
Why don't you guys all this group up and make your own and now we're back to YouTube

149
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Kind of

150
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Words to make people have to pay for the lies you tell them really sucks me

151
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Definitely

152
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Not Lies We Tell You

153
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
You know

154
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Kind of expected

155
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,471
These some people are and some people are out there

156
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
You keep some people in the fold but you're definitely going to lose some of that audience

157
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,943
What's less expected is it a couple commenters point out in the comments section at the page

158
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,575
Where you're supposed to sign up for a membership to be new Project Camelot is an unsecured website

159
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
All right for myself and sure enough it is an unsecured page which is pretty f****** days

160
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Put my

161
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
Let's put all my credit card on an unsecured

162
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
Anyone sign up for Subscription Service could have had their information stolen

163
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
I think this is a terrible plan I have zero faith that it's actually going to work out well

164
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,831
Is pretty decent chance it'll just end up staying on YouTube

165
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
This is dumb dumb

166
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
Unless you're also putting all your content up on YouTube

167
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,607
You're never going to reach people who might stumble across your contact

168
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
Like it's just it seems like shooting yourself in the foot in order to make a couple bucks

169
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
If you mix a significant amount of money from YouTube monetization

170
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
And that's all gone then she has no income

171
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
So she tries to replace it with her

172
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
I guess

173
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Subscription

174
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
But nobody's go

175
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,927
It doesn't seem like that

176
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
Yeah I mean she might as well sell hats

177
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Actually does bring up the series going to start selling summer

178
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
Ideal

179
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,775
I don't feel that bad cuz

180
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Honestly

181
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
We don't sell any

182
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
No

183
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,735
I don't feel bad for the situation because it's like yes

184
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
Sitting around talking about how the coronavirus is turning people into vampire China

185
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,951
There is a virus

186
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,815
YouTube has every right to say you can't make money off these videos

187
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
The past

188
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
So I don't feel bad about anybody

189
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
People shooting situation

190
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,639
I do wish her luck on some level

191
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,967
Except I don't because I also might be an anti-semite

192
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Kind of isn't

193
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
This is to me this is a lot like

194
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Al Capone kind of situation

195
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
You're getting her where her money

196
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
You're not getting her for her actual crime

197
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,631
Disinformation is going to get people hurt

198
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Even killed

199
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
But what you're doing is you're just taking away your money straight

200
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
Yeah I get what you're saying but she should probably be arraigned on some other day

201
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
You know as long as three speeches thing I don't know what you're going to do with that

202
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Some lawsuit I wonder what his tax

203
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Who knows

204
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
What is it what's the name of it

205
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,399
Now I'm mad

206
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Goddamn know it's bad in San Francisco

207
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
Later than we normally do and I think it's affecting

208
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
This might be our last rodeo with the Project Camelot is what I'm saying

209
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
Yeah

210
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
That makes me feel a little bit stupid about this is a we've already been like

211
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
You know it is

212
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,591
There is still content that's not behind a paywall that's still on YouTube that I

213
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Still considered a game through the possibility of Raptors and

214
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
The Mercantile Mercantile dog

215
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
Spider leadership

216
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
And so we will go on this

217
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Last

218
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Adventure

219
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
In theory

220
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Today wonderful

221
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
A couple days earlier

222
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
Before she made the announcement

223
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Krypton model

224
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
Carrie got interviewed by a guy named Shepherd ambulance

225
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Okay well I had an organization

226
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
I guess call

227
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Called intellihub

228
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
And YouTube

229
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
View that started it all

230
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Alex

231
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
I've had him on as a gas

232
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Very regularly

233
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,895
He's tried to give him a job on there all the time I

234
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,271
He was one of these sources for Alex's coverage of the Las Vegas shooting

235
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Shepherd

236
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
I would go on to talk about how there were helicopters in the crowd

237
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,535
And what-have-you is a real ding-dong adjacent to Alex

238
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
This is a really close to your need six

239
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Degrees of Separation. Just one

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
This is

241
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
DirecTV literally is Kevin Baker

242
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
He is a guy interviewing Kerry Cassidy

243
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Bulshit you got going on

244
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
So are we starting Shepherd

245
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551

253
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383

Her website

255
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Project Camelot

256
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Portal

257
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759

00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319

259
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087

Thousand interview

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Whistleblowers

262
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
First question

263
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Should you have

264
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Fascinating stories I've ever

265
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Heard in my life

266
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
Alright came from

267
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
A lot of your interviews

268
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Fascinating People

269
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,031
This guy is terrible

270
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,431
He's got an awful interview-style you've got an awful droning voice

271
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
It's very top

272
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Whistleblowers

273
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
Most Fascinating Amazing Stories

274
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
You talking about how the Walking with Dinosaurs actually

275
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
No it's like interview

276
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,567
So is this is our last time

277
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
Sitting around talking with Carrie

278
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,455
It's actually kind of fitting because Shepherd ask her

279
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
About her route

280
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
How did this the hardest get going

281
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
Did the creation of Project Camelot and of course

282
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
It's a career that didn't work out show

283
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Okay well I

284
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Started out

285
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Actually I was

286
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Working in Hollywood

287
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
20 years

288
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
And

289
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
I reached

290
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
I decided

291
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Consumer-grade camcorder

292
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And

293
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
I started going out

294
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,223
Consumer-grade by the way

295
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Attempting

296
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Call Princess

297
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Actually got this

298
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
This idea that I would make

299
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Documentary saying

300
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Have you seen you

301
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Talk about everybody else

302
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
But not themselves

303
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
I like that idea I like that

304
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,591
I don't want to talk about what you know about the subject

305
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Have you seen it

306
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:05,759
I have not seen one I've not a series of interviews that last about

307
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,367
14 seconds that start with have you seen a UFO and somebody's like

308
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
Alright

309
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Next person also

310
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Great way to phrase it

311
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,863
Glass ceiling in Hollywood

312
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:28,287
That's a perfect right has so many comics

313
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Idaho

314
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
100000 comics

315
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Which is not

316
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
Say that women do not hit the glass

317
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
Harry hit the glass yes I think Carrie Coon

318
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
Dealing with a lot more I don't want

319
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,127
Camcorder in Espanol

320
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
Do prunes in the second half

321
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
You didn't hit the first happen

322
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,952
If that's the first project that you go to after your Unshackled to Hollywood dreams or whatever

323
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:27,168
Best ideas whenever I say

324
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Is it gone great church

325
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
Maybe a better way to put it is looking plateau

326
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,664
My career

327
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
In her

328
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,088
Trajectory of trying to make a documentary

329
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,928
Admit very very

330
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,024
Who ended up being

331
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,888
Is incarnation of King Arthur

332
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
From King Arthur or something

333
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Also came across

334
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Call Ryan

335
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Partner

336
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Camelot

337
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
2

338
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Was representing the

339
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
And

340
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Invited

341
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Later app

342
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
And

343
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
I interviewed

344
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
We ended up staying in

345
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Best friend

346
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
And I

347
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
I got a small

348
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Okay

349
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Turn on the way back

350
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Showed me

351
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Fireplace

352
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
England

353
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Casual wear

354
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Arthur

355
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
And that's where the idea was born to

356
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
Create a website

357
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Impressed

358
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,376
There's no consensus King Arthur was a real person

359
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Historical

360
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
Also

361
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,664
Place working Arthur was conceived

362
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Based on

363
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,064
Being in the Wolves appreciate a legend

364
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
Subsumed by such banality

365
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,280
The king who brought all of Britain together and pulled the sword from the stone

366
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,168
Peterbilt

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
It makes me wonder if you use like

368
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
Mark Richards as like Galahad

369
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
I'd like to see Lancelot

370
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
I would love to see what the round table is in a Kentucky

371
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
I think I'm out

372
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Don't remember anymore

373
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
Demonetization thing that you did

374
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Completely bizarre be

375
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Because also

376
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Viewership

377
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
L'artisan stay and

378
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
It had even jumped

379
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
In the last 3 months like

380
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
So I was

381
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Why is work

382
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
Yeah but the bottom line is

383
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Weeks ago today

384
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
You know

385
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Deleted

386
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
And then the

387
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
Same night

388
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
Miles Johnston

389
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
What other people

390
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Same thing

391
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Clamping down there doing

392
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Bishop thing and

393
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
And embarrassed

394
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Completely

395
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Pensacola

396
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Cuz I don't

397
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
Have any video sure

398
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
I had a problem

399
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,120
Because

400
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,960
You think there isn't a virus

401
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
If you don't like it is it is an interesting thing that like a lot of

402
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
Conspiracy theories are just sort of been ignored and

403
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,736
You know one of the compelling reasons why

404
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
In theory

405
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:31,648
Is that other conspiracy theories can lead you to radicalization that could lead you to take violent action

406
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
But it's not really essentially dangerous

407
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,816
Like talking about how the Illuminati is in control of the world and they put

408
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Pyramid the music videos

409
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
That's not not real

410
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
With you wanting to hurt Jay Z made

411
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,664
But ultimately it's also just kind of stupid

412
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,248
It's relatively harmless

413
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
Conspiracies about there not being virus

414
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,928
Very easily lead you to take actions that end up putting yourself and others at risk

415
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Director

416
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,560
I can see why you take this more seriously and have a different approach to it

417
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Although it does

418
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,888
It does hurt Things That No One

419
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,264
Do this in the past

420
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
That's David Icke Spa

421
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
I mean honestly not listening to that

422
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
George Clinton song then

423
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
The bottom line here is the Carrie knows exactly what the f*** is going on

424
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
Anybody Who's acting honestly about this

425
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
They wouldn't be they wouldn't be behaving

426
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
Pretend like I didn't do anything

427
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Alright whatever

428
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
So

429
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
This is pretty funny to me

430
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Shepherd

431
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
Is talking about

432
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
He's like

433
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
YouTube owes him tens of thousands of dollars for back revenue or something

434
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
Read down too much

435
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
You're doing

436
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Weird thing they did to me was

437
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
I basically haven't use my channel again

438
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
Five six seven eight years or so

439
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,664
I got mad because they were basically

440
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
Not ever letting me know

441
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
Even though they never

442
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
About it it's like

443
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Figured out I don't know

444
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
I stopped kind of using the platform and I was just doing my wife

445
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Tyrese

446
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Start this pod

447
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
And it's kind of going

448
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
You know and it's

449
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
I mean

450
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
It's only gotten thousands of

451
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Abuser whatever

452
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
It's starting to pick up and then

453
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
All of a sudden

454
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
I get a notice

455
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
That 6 videos

456
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Copyright strike

457
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,456
Conspiracy

458
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
Feel like he's just explaining what's going

459
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah in a very simple indirect list

460
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,048
Because

461
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,376
But they never said it maybe I just couldn't figure out how to do it

462
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
You couldn't figure out how to do it

463
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
Years later I put Avengers

464
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,736
They wouldn't let me monetize say I don't understand

465
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,320
Did everything Tuesday yeah those copyright strikes do happen

466
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Sometimes it's

467
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
Wildlife

468
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
We posted a couple of our episodes

469
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
On YouTube

470
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
And we've gotten copyright strikes on all of the

471
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
Because of Alex it's because of the music Alex uses in and out of

472
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,272
We couldn't do it because whoever owns the rights to Silver Stallion

473
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,648
Or some Highwaymen song copyright

474
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:21,536
Of course so I wouldn't be too surprised if it was something even if it is like Shepherd using

475
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Footage from

476
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,192
News broadcast it is not the rights to

477
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
It doesn't mean your shift gets taken down it just means if you tried monetize if they get a cut

478
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Of course I don't

479
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,784
I just don't like big baby

480
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
And they're notorious for being

481
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Copyright

482
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Pick up most of the show

483
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:55,072
So carries trying to this point I don't think she has decided on going with

484
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
Subscription model

485
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,680
If you still trying to figure out what you going to do about the demonetization

486
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
And Shepherd has a dumb idea

487
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
What about just having your own products like us

488
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Snoop Dogg doesn't show any of like

489
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Sneakers

490
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
That's because

491
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
Yeah that's it that's

492
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
Question I mean we are

493
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Actually

494
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Right now

495
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
Zinc baby

496
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
So yeah

497
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Not tonight

498
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
The rent I know

499
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
It's stopping this

500
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
This is what they're doing

501
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Information

502
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
What's the new world order

503
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Nicole

504
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Covina Lane

505
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
It's the

506
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,440
Flaws of shepherds

507
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
Play no one would pay for everything

508
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
Able to sell any ads

509
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
2

510
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Joshua cucumbers there's a slight difference in relative credibility of popular

511
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
30 between herself and Snoop Dogg

512
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,176
Yeah I'm just saying she could sell some random head

513
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,064
Tell me about the home game gorilla

514
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
Space definitely

515
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
I will say though I like to imagine that she's the same level of Snoop Dogg and that

516
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
When they did the all cities remix of welcome to Atlanta

517
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,104
That would be great

518
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,992
Talk about it

519
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
And that's what she's going to drop an LP that's going to blow her mind

520
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
So

521
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,952
Shepherd

522
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Responses interesting

523
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
You were talk

524
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
What about a vortex

525
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Earlier I had a

526
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Really interest

527
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Experiencing

528
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Sedona with what I think

529
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Was a boy.

530
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Tell you about something

531
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Also I have

532
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Read

533
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Very

534
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
UFOs in one was at

535
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Cedar Point

536
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
I saw all the men

537
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Catalan

538
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
Bored one day

539
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
Yeah

540
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah

541
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
How you want it

542
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
Generally I remember back

543
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,064
Whatever the responses

544
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:01,952
Yeah that's that's all right

545
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,560
Response

546
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,400
Gary I've had a lot of experiences that would go great on your show

547
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
I got to go

548
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,872
I promise you

549
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
I don't impose

550
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
Discusses her research

551
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,088
Into covid-19

552
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:37,280
Justin Bombshells hear that

553
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Hurt her monetization traffic

554
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Can tell you is

555
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Says that

556
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
A grave

557
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
Is basically been

558
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
The guardian said that

559
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Started

560
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Breeding a bioweapon

561
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
Carolina

562
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
These women

563
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
In front of me

564
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
DNA

565
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
That's from The Times-Picayune

566
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,568
Yeah that's what I was kind of trying to pick your brain cuz I'm

567
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
I'm trying to like

568
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
What I came up with

569
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
What is like

570
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
All this stuff

571
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Really

572
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Suspiciously

573
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:35,136
I don't know if it's the same things together

574
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
IPhone

575
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Together

576
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,560
It's all coming together

577
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,376
The time together

578
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,240
Aliens biological weapon

579
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
You got evil

580
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Scientist

581
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Right it is all coming together

582
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
That is that is the progression that I was looking

583
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:06,624
I don't know I don't necessarily dangerous

584
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Outright denialism

585
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,744
Is more dangerous from just like a what kind of behaviors

586
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Could it

587
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,608
Endorse

588
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
Mercury is like this is alien

589
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
IAAI

590
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
Dangerous but I would still say

591
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Trespassed line

592
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,896
Yeah but it's just unfortunate

593
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Noticed

594
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,784
Quite frankly

595
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Biscuits right back to are the grifters

596
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
Perfect if you stay in that sweet

597
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,256
Spot if you get to Big the Griff fails and if you're not big enough the grift

598
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Yeah

599
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,632
Celebrity

600
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,264
Going to like you want to be in the middle you don't want to be so people start to treat you

601
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
With the people

602
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:08,320
Being that level

603
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
People don't know who you are

604
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,976
Exactly that's the best

605
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,632
Stay in the middle the end zone

606
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
Propaganda

607
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
That's what you got to do

608
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
So Shepherd

609
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
Sort-of is implying that

610
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,688
Maybe their space stuff involved with coronavirus but it's unclear

611
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Carrie's instabake that he thinks

612
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
Covid-19 came from space

613
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
She doesn't real

614
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Technology

615
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Embedded

616
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
That apps

617
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Was put there

618
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Many many years

619
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Shoot-down

620
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
This has been longing

621
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Again a method of

622
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
War

623
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Reasonable

624
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Atlantis was sunken

625
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Ways that we

626
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Hitting it

627
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Sure

628
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
And so on so

629
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Jarvis

630
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Now

631
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
I know that

632
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
It sounds as though you're try

633
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
You say that

634
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Covid case

635
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Meteor

636
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
But I do

637
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,496
Well no no not really although I did

638
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Do some research on that

639
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Like that is pause

640
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Okay

641
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248
Yes

642
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Focuses their conversation is about like

643
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Object

644
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:57,376
They're all his there's been a barrage of them carries beliefs about this is that whenever there's me

645
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,936
Meteors are comets they're actually projectiles

646
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:09,152
EXO

647
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Going to be real bummed in 2040 when we fight the Vietnam War it again that'll be that'll be

648
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Pretty sad

649
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
There their idea and comets near worth

650
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
Objects are generally a means of

651
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Chameleons

652
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
And she wants to clarify

653
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
Soda Shepherd

654
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
But they're not saying

655
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,992
The coronavirus is from space

656
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
So there's all these rules man you know

657
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
People that's where are we supposed to wear masks in stores

658
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Stuff like that

659
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
I'm sure they're Pro those

660
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
Like if you go to the beach

661
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Sometimes

662
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,216
People at beaches don't follow rules

663
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
And those my friend

664
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,800
Are the cool t-shirts

665
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Intelligent

666
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Governor

667
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Bars are open

668
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
State

669
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
People are

670
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Amanda Ivanova

671
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Opened up the beach

672
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
California

673
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Lay on

674
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Nonetheless

675
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
And people are ignoring

676
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Stomach

677
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
Cool beaches

678
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
You should be leaving the coronavirus response want just enumerate

679
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Mission of which beaches are coolgardie scary and wishon.

680
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,576
Find the banks of the sand in covid-19 disappear

681
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Beach

682
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
Cool beaches

683
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
So Carrie

684
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,352
We know that she's known to talk to Weirdos like

685
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
The

686
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
Who

687
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,736
Made a movie and remember his name Ronald there's the super soldiers

688
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,856
Who are weird there's both the guy who can Channel people but doesn't need to voice

689
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
But also

690
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Not the guy who can handle all sorts of folks.

691
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Murderer

692
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Top of Diamond Park

693
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
The former MP

694
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,360
I still think he's a good guy

695
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:54,016
So it's a

696
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
Credible source

697
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
I can't say this is

698
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
And tell you that

699
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
White House

700
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
2

701
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
The cute

702
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Anyway

703
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,968
There was a fly thing that flew in

704
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,648
Real flying Nanobots

705
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,720
Space Program

706
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
And I can tell you that

707
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
That

708
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Trump's latest statement about

709
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
He's rolling out

710
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Call it

711
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
She's great on Saturday

712
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Rapid fire

713
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Because they're all great on that

714
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
It's like

715
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Another words

716
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
In a race

717
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
With gay

718
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Who is working

719
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
DARPA

720
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Sure

721
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
And

722
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Department of the

723
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
How does that work

724
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Right

725
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Government

726
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Is in charge

727
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Is it

728
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
1up

729
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Trump

730
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
What does that even mean

731
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Getting a virus

732
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
So if you're if you're following here but she has people that she's in direct contact or involved with

733
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
Trump team at the Q team chorus goes across areas of a coon dog person

734
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
Fast track of vaccine is really just him trying to race built

735
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Is Bill Gates's going to make

736
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Evil vaccine

737
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
I just wish everybody could hate Bill Gates for the same reason I hate Bill Gates which is purely

738
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
He has

739
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
Too much money take care our criticism

740
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
Philanthropic stuff there are some questions

741
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,351
Kind of appositive

742
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,935
And what I see that

743
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Has a berry naked within it

744
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
But it feels like it's their way through

745
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,967
Psychologically dealing with the inevitability of needing a vaccine about you

746
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,367
At least

747
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,951
Scene

748
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,023
I will let you know how you get

749
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,143
Buried

750
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,959
Further people down into the only tropic

751
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:58,591
Can save us in a Public Health crisis

752
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
That's the story you tell yourself

753
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Whatever

754
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,247
A vaccine is going to, they're not going to give

755
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Trump credit for it

756
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,391
Write like there's no way they don't say well it's because Trump did

757
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Most likely end

758
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
So you see these things that trumps doing like signaling that he's okay with vaccines

759
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,215
Racist

760
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Henry Ford level like

761
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
I like Hitler like that kind

762
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:36,223
We don't talk about that

763
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,111
It's important for weirdos I carry and Alex

764
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,439
To talk about the stuff like when Trump says

765
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Hey we're doing this stuff

766
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
The vaccines

767
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
Because they're so against vaccines they have to figure out how to make it okay cuz otherwise it should be

768
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
Prop

769
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,495
And waiting to do this is by

770
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Saying that he's

771
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Competitive

772
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,967
Art of War for the chest

773
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
People don't

774
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Stan house

775
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Operate

776
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
And don't they

777
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Video song

778
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Who sings this

779
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
The state of the game

780
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
2

781
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
That one's son's you called it with

782
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
And not appear

783
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Against

784
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
What they are at

785
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
And so there

786
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
You're going along

787
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Stay on

788
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Parallel

789
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
To the enemy

790
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
Up Intuit

791
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
When they

792
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Enchanted

793
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Overtake

794
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
So or not

795
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,559
You know that's also a possibility

796
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,863
Hurts my brain more than theirs

797
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,935
I want because it's stuff

798
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,495
Like the level of cognitive dissonance

799
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
Makes my brain like

800
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,335
Explode with I need like

801
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,663
10 Tylenol and they're just like well obviously

802
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,479
10 million

803
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
That we never happen

804
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:21,695
Yeah it's like we're going down this road

805
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
It's just another right

806
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
Goodluck Goodluck

807
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:32,959
Insane so we have a little bit of a shorter interview cuz there's not a whole lot going

808
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
Some bombs of Interest

809
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
Cool beaches

810
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:49,087
Oh you know ogres telling you that you're a bunch of nerds for opening of your beaches

811
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,951
King Arthur

812
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,023
Demonstration of

813
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Something that really confuses

814
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,143
I'm not actually certain whether they

815
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
People are joking or not

816
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Merlin

817
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Aged

818
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Backward

819
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,823
Now I know that you'll get a lot of people

820
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
Get stuck on you know you read that

821
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Fitzgerald

822
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,711
He couldn't do

823
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
Any magic

824
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
What's the point

825
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
There's a good point

826
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,439
I need you to help me get to the bottom of their joke

827
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
I think they're joke

828
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
I am underprepared

829
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Drilling outside all the sudden

830
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
That's alright go ahead now it's

831
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Yeah I know that Hopper

832
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
They started

833
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Mowing lawn

834
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Do you think they're joking absolutely not

835
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
I can't tell cuz he's laughing Shepherds

836
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,375
Really think that like some Drilling and some construction

837
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,447
What's going on or some neighbor mowing the lawn

838
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,031
Is a deep State attack when you're trying to record something

839
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
That's back to me is if they're not joking that's f****** scary that level of paranoia is

840
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,319
Really really weird is like when I make a joke about something that

841
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,599
Actually happen again

842
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
You know like

843
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:32,255
I make a joke

844
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,815
This here's my commentary on that

845
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Not like

846
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,191
Situation

847
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
Array

848
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
I'm telling truth

849
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,503
There's a certain amount of discomfort that is causing the last

850
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,831
Absolutely telling the truth on what they plan

851
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,415
It's got to be frustrating way to live

852
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
Hilarious

853
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
How they're doing

854
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:09,375
Yeah isn't it hilarious that is or isn't it hilarious if they were doing this

855
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,191
It's hilarious that the evil people are using

856
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,519
A lawnmower I'm not a f****** laser

857
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:20,383
Bright with things like

858
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
Carrie thinking there's like

859
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,807
Problems attack from the globalist

860
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:34,207
Yeah yeah

861
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:40,607
My window weekend was a patriot act

862
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,423
That must be what

863
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,263
American militia

864
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,663
Water dripping from I did notice this is weird I did notice

865
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:58,527
I looked up in my window

866
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,927
I thought that was your rock.

867
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
American Water

868
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,023
37

869
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,607
Seems like a really unsatisfying

870
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,375
In frustrating

871
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,215
Way to look at things like everything is an attack everything must be

872
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,775
Coordinated in some way

873
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,383
What

874
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
The paranoia

875
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Is Joseph

876
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
Beer and yet

877
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Treated mocking

878
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
You know what I'm saying

879
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,159
You like I'd believe that they believe that they are under it

880
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,743
Hack but the implications of their attack

881
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
Is so massive

882
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,583
And so huge

883
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
That it seems ridiculous to treat it as like

884
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Oh man

885
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,287
Don't you see how weird it is that this Global Interstellar

886
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,127
Bucking cabal of monsters fighting with aliens

887
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
Is using the lawn mowers

888
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
Like do you not understand how much

889
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,063
More terrifying is that they usually see I don't think

890
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,207
That's what he's laughing

891
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,327
No it's B it really it's up satellites

892
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,911
If this is the end

893
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
Then this is the end

894
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
It is

895
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,055
Kind of

896
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,591
Ultimately that's

897
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,151
What everyone needs to know is that Carrie is very boring

898
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:35,551
This show is incredibly boring except for the parts that I end up finding

899
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,599
This is kind of a fitting

900
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Close

901
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
Cota

902
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,023
Is the to be interviewed by somebody who is an Infowars associate

903
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
For someone who is

904
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
Like a guest

905
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Pretty regularly on Alex's show

906
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
Ifucking higher

907
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,263
So you see this like these two important pieces

908
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
She's boring and this is

909
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Pretty much

910
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Because at this point

911
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Very similar

912
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,991
Herspace of the secret space program weirdo alien shed

913
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Is

914
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
More less

915
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Normal

916
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,391
Bray Wingstop South

917
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,439
Has no further

918
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
You know no further non connection

919
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Yeah like it's all one big

920
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,375
Perfect Circle

921
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:26,239
Becoming more and more that her anymore

922
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:31,871
Well good luck on your subscription service

923
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,479
I don't know what else to say yeah I don't know good luck

924
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:43,135
Will be what it is another episode

925
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,695
The website is not

926
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
We are Intruders at no just go to bed Jordan world

927
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,751
If you would like please donate to a local charity in your area we would

928
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,087
Alex
