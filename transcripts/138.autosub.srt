Schlafly Brewery

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,824
I love Saint Louis Italy throw this out the window

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
If it was associated with

13
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,136
So anyway

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
Could you turn me up a little bit I can turn up the cans

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
Do for you today but alright

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Alright

17
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,240
I realize that I've been a little bit lacking in

18
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
And some ways

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Ewoks at the moment and I believe

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
However you can go to knowledge hi.com quicksupport the show

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
We would appreciate

22
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
But I've been really terrible about getting back to people who emailed

23
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
I apologize everybody is said

24
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
You know damn I'm feeling I'm feeling good everybody I'm feeling very

25
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,784
Self-conscious about it in terms of like keeping up with the communications and I'm going to get back to everybody

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,904
As quickly as I can that I had not

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,744
I got to get to what's going on here

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
One of the reasons that I hit

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Not gotten back to us because it was Avengers Initiative related

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,336
Got caught up doing the endgame coverage at the same time

31
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
But

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
I want to make this clear

33
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Next episode

34
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088

38
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Involved

39
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Call Deanna

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
I'm going to be gone for a week

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Whole wheat

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,944
Who's going to be in a conversation

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,064
Have you do another Field Report like you did

44
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
Forehead art

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
You might have to

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Free for a little bit

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
I think Alex Jones might also be needing everyone involved in Infowars

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
Is probably on the cusp of fleeing but but their words

49
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Would not indicate that

50
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Here's an out-of-context dropped from Today Show

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Nowhere

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
He personally feels very strong I personally

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,416
Feel very strong cast long long exhale

54
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
So what I want to do is when we do these episodes give you a

55
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Philly

56
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,568

57
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848

We don't need to talk about that but will be going over the 13th 14th and 15

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,047
Ocean today

62
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
Some would say it's obvious living

63
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Let me give it to you this way

64
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
My ability to plan with you is not existed getting caught up with all sorts of other side

65
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
Workout

66
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,551
Pretty much everything except for the Ender game coverage

67
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Has been the idea that I've had that about

68
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Is going to be really fun

69
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Alex has been on

70
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Some real bulshit this week

71
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
We all know he's getting food

72
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
Another lawsuit comes around

73
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
And the way he escalates is

74
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Classic

75
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
UCB style improv

76
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
It's alright it's saying how quickly alright

77
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
From reality

78
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,623
Play Never starts with e starts with an elevator

79
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
And then gets to a preposterous

80
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Another long way there's a lot of really stupid things

81
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,655
But we're going to start

82
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Shockingly close

83
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383

Epsom salt

86
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
About this lawsuit

87
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,391
And this one is being brought against

88
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791

On Tuesday

94
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Conspiracy theories

95
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,271
But he was working as a deep-sea operative for the governor

96
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
That's the basics about this lawsuit but Alex Jones

97
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207

Right

100
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
Debatable

101
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
That's kind of a compliment the weirdest part about your way more than what

102
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
You actually are I don't agree with that assessment

103
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,151
Spiritually deserves to lose this lawsuit

104
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Think he can probably win

105
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
Horse saddle

106
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295

00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Yeah you got a lot of people with

108
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
You know

109
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511

So they're already the public

114
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,671
Public figure he's harder to slander

115
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
Guaranteed

116
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095

So Allie Max bringing her in here

124
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
That might be great

125
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
A little bit

126
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
It's because she did the interview some of the interviews and questioned the people she interviewed is also being

127
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:32,255

In the interview about the Charlottesville rally

134
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
He compared what was going on there with

135
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
The Russian version of events in the Ukraine

136
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775

192
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
You think you're going to be some Amicus brief today

193
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
I guess they think they got everything worked out

194
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Catherine Virginia

195
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,023
The best laid plans of mice and men

196
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Austin

197
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Though

198
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Australia

199
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
It's hard to tell if he couldn't come up with the end of the quote or he was doing that for Jamaica

200
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
I'm going to

201
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Often

202
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
They often go

203
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
Out-of-this-world

204
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Martian base

205
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
No literature is

206
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
Coordinates

207
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Let's not

208
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
Too much because I can't

209
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Serious

210
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,591
This is so tertiary today at the matter of him

211
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
So we've got go how do you feel about letting

212
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Okay

213
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Problematic character but 11

214
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
We start with Brennan Gilmore

215
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Is doing

216
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Then we bring in the Jets

217
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
Now we we've established that I would leave the Jesuits

218
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
I promise you I promise

219
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Everything

220
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Taxpayers financing the Jesuits

221
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Explain everything

222
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,479
I have so many questions one more installation that needs to happen before we reveal the truth

223
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
U.s. Bank Fairmont

224
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,351
Georgetown was founded in 79

225
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Washington d.c.

226
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Basically is today

227
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
But

228
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
So now the pope is doing

229
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Sir

230
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Is suing him

231
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Yeah this is a pope ever delegate

232
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
No the pope to any of these people literally right

233
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,887
Yeah yeah hope is going to be defending himself in court against Alex

234
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
I'm so I did all of this all of this

235
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Just

236
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Comes back

237
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
To a couple of stray facts

238
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
And it's basically all because

239
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
Brandon Gilmore the suit that he is bringing

240
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Was filed in court

241
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
5D Georgetown civil rights

242
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Talk to Georgetown University civil rights Clinic

243
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
Yes clinic

244
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,383
Here are the only facts you really need to know

245
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:21,759
Carol quickly does the white smoke come out

246
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
This is nonsense

247
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
Georgetown University is a Jesuit university or historically has

248
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,399
Who Alex Jones hates entire book

249
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Professor at Georgetown

250
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Ergo Alex

251
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Connecting those things

252
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
What was filed by the Georgetown civil

253
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Wright's Clinic

254
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,223
I'm going to read to hear from their website with a civil rights clinic is

255
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
Civil rights Clinic

256
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah I suppose I don't need to read the paragraph

257
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Operates as a public interest law firm representing clients in

258
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Public interest organization

259
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
Primarily in the areas of discrimination in concert

260
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Additional rights workplace fairness and open government

261
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
Sounds like a pope students developed

262
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,127
How to file complaints in federal and state courts conduct Discovery engage in motion

263
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Practice and prepare Appeals

264
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,063
Is what like it's what you can do get therapy

265
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
This is essentially he is doing them

266
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Through

267
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
Like probably deserve money

268
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,631
Who's the number one Law School

269
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
America better than a lot of lawyers

270
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,687
You know what why is it Georgetown is it because it's the pope and the Jesuits could be no it's because

271
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
Best university in a two-mile drive from Charlottesville Virginia

272
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
It really close to Charlottesville Virginia

273
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,815
And it's consistently the number one law school in America

274
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,191
Georgetown no I'm sure because of the area that the offense

275
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Took place or I'm sure that

276
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,567
He has to bring it into a court in that area

277
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
And what's the best I don't know I don't know what Brandon Gilmore is addresses

278
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
Georgetown University you might have connections

279
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Go to Georgetown

280
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Connecting like

281
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
If you just to think logically about it like

282
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
The tragedy happened in Charlottesville Virginia

283
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
And 120 miles away

284
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Is Georgetown University closed up in Columbia Missouri

285
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
The University of Missouri's pretty good

286
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
I guess

287
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
If I needed

288
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,415
I don't know what Webster does Webster University in St Louis.

289
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Question

290
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
Alright so we know the ncaa's an evil organization

291
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
I've heard that

292
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
They if the students are

293
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
4

294
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
The lawsuit for being his lawyer

295
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
Ineligible for the law tournament

296
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
It's absolutely

297
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,271
Experience course credit

298
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
Brighten Alex is misaligned

299
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
The way he's escalating his own oppression

300
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
And let me tell you this

301
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
It's not done

302
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,911
He's going to escalated even further but we will have to wait

303
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
You see it's a little bit later

304
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,335
It's a little bit later. I'll get there in a bit first Alex Jones

305
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,663
The only thing

306
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
Does he save the pope is almost as bad as the juice

307
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
No it'll say something really sucked up in the next place though

308
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
Here's your sister

309
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Boxers

310
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
And I'm so honored

311
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Abreva

312
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,447
Tennessee

313
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
He's not doing it

314
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
He shall products

315
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
Something really terrible

316
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
And it starts

317
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,231
Starts with Alex

318
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,655
He's encouraging people who went to Georgetown and their alums to stop giving them money

319
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,287
Really I don't have the clip of it but on one of these shows he says that they've been going

320
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
Through the alumni rolodexes Georgetown

321
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Contacting alarms and stuff

322
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,807
Which I don't I don't know how I feel about that you got to do

323
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
You're not

324
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Susceptible

325
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
I would imagine.

326
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
That's sort of his plan is I'm going to

327
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
I'm going to crush Georgia University

328
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,888
That works but unfortunately it says something at the end of the clip that

329
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Should make any Georgetown

330
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,080
All of your alumni Georgetown as well but you got to pull your money

331
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
Other people

332
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
I'm having my rights violated by Jim Crow

333
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
I don't think that's true cuz they're suing you

334
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
They're not

335
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
Discounting you as a human being

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Brightright

337
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Right

338
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
Like they're like

339
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:01,472
Literally going to treat you as an equal by going into court with you as opposed to being like

340
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
You're not allowed

341
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
Yeah.

342
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
This is

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Keep calm

344
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
B firm position on Alex

345
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Go to court

346
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
Lake bright if you don't have if your rights are being

347
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Violated

348
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Go to court

349
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
You have to

350
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah

351
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Got show up

352
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Well I mean

353
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
He's not going to be treated

354
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Barely

355
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
If there's anything

356
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
If there's anything I know about

357
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
The justice

358
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Is that rich people are never treated

359
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Did fairly rich white males especially

360
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
System

361
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Hey

362
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Rich white male

363
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
There's no way to have

364
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Is fair day

365
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,488
But I just

366
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
Concerns that he's screaming about in making up

367
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Like okay

368
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
You believe that the Jesuits

369
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Through you through this

370
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
Right taxpayer-funded

371
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
Go to court

372
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
And make that argument

373
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
See how it flies

374
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,688
Anywhere but on your stupid show me how

375
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Anybody

376
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,600
Because you know

377
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Fine I would love that

378
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Beautiful

379
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,512
We go back to this over and over again the concept of proving something

380
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
Alex versus the real world

381
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Are very different thing

382
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,520
Behind

383
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Sir sir

384
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:46,944
This is about your comment I made about this guy

385
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Who is not the pope if you recall

386
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
I think in the in the just

387
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
In the justices

388
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
I got a scary those hiccups anjal

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Scary

390
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
In the justice system

391
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
Alex is a very different man

392
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
No I mean he was screaming it is

393
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Custody

394
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
Well yeah but that was he was going to lose too much month

395
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
YouTube kids

396
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
Do you want to take

397
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Gargle some water

398
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
No I think I'll be okay

399
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Actually worked I don't know about that

400
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
I think I'll have a cigarette

401
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
That's as a cure-all for everything

402
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,816
I'm in the next clip Alex Jones rocks out to a little bit of music and then make

403
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Revelation

404
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Is an exaggerated

405
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,968
Red Rocker brake guy

406
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
On just one more

407
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Ally

408
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,824
Did Hillary lawyers have filed

409
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
Studio season 12

410
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Lawsuits

411
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
And most of the last couple months

412
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
I think the number is high

413
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,160
Because he goes on to say that you had six of them thrown out of court

414
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
I think he's creating fake lawsuit

415
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
Pretend

416
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:43,680
Shamefully settled the lawsuits that we're aware of and the other ones are still pending

417
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,288
Exaggerating

418
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
But at this point Alex

419
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
If he has 12 lawsuits pending

420
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Cuz I can't imagine what those other one

421
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Yeah I know

422
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Number is a fair chance he can win this one

423
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Separate lawsuits for child

424
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
That could be

425
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,096
If you can

426
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
I don't know I don't know enough

427
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
About law

428
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Another lawyer

429
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,496
But I don't I don't think it's

430
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Totally out of

431
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Like the realm of believability they

432
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
Did he could win

433
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
This one against Brandon Gilmore

434
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
I think it's possible

435
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
And I think the one again

436
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
The Pepe copyright infringement lawsuit I think it's very possible that as well

437
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
EEOC complaint

438
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,464
I think are much more of a toss-up I think

439
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Probably going to have to settle those

440
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
But

441
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
He's not going to win against actually back

442
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
Don't seem like it but I think he's going to settle those

443
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
I don't know there's

444
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
Like the oppression that he's presenting doesn't make sense

445
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Be pretty decent

446
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Position do you then

447
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
They considering all he's going to do is lose a bit of money

448
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
I mean not against the Pope

449
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
Volvo

450
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
The pope is not implant he's going to lose

451
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Is Boston

452
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Andrew Jackson

453
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,936
No not at all I was going to go with

454
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Lindbergh

455
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Gustav Lindberg

456
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
We've always heard Alex

457
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
Keep children tied up in their basements

458
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:43,744
We hear that all the time twist

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
On this episode Alex Jones

460
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Presents himself

461
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
And America

462
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
As being the ones

463
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Trapped in the basement

464
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,008
That's interesting and because of that it's not quite

465
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,080
Is gross to listen to right so I'm going to go ahead and play it

466
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,456
Who's keeping him in the basement pitstick globalist and maybe one of them is a worm being

467
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Everybody knows what

468
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Control

469
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,360
Basically

470
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Kick you in the face a little bit

471
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Open

472
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Both arms out of shackles

473
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,640
You open the trapdoor to come down

474
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Metaphysical

475
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
Dark Souls

476
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,744
And around

477
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
And you're screaming for Mama

478
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
410

479
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
Down the stairs

480
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:06,080
What are we going to do that big giant

481
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
What are we going to do that worm

482
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,904
I mean the only answer is murdered right kills I do the worm

483
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
You have no chance against

484
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
The big worm

485
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,352
Okay so it's either we're going to get f***** up by that worms

486
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,704
I have literature

487
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Fanfiction

488
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
There is a

489
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
The Tremors were sure they were there

490
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Pack all this

491
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
I don't know who he thinks is winning in the

492
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,072
Free and put a piece off the baby

493
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
I don't know America has opposable

494
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
Trump getting in his arms getting Free Rx that metaphor

495
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Maybe

496
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,600
We don't have any clips of it cuz there's really inconsequential but he's thrilled with Tillis

497
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,888
Play her we're on our third little bit of tillerson's farewell

498
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
Press conference

499
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Alex

500
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Clearly

501
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Confused

502
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
By the language

503
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
This is all code

504
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,296
Nutella seems clearly talking to a globalist stay behind Network

505
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
Okay break Tillerson

506
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
Famously getting rid of most of the state department

507
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
Has a stay behind his death

508
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,144
Got fired 2 there is no one

509
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,728
Snowsuit

510
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
Torture Master like what what are we doing

511
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,064
Comes on and I think

512
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Is Eddie

513
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
Why would the CIA director b.good

514
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't know man

515
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Alex makes the argument that the

516
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
CIA is run by

517
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
EXO

518
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Of course

519
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
I mean

520
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,776
That's his explanation for why it's cool that the CIA director br

521
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Chief diplomatic officer

522
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
Done

523
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,784
Like everything is soaked Through The Looking glasses

524
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
What is happening

525
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
I don't even know

526
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Nothing

527
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Everything and nothing

528
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,144
I don't know I don't know what to tell you no take on it

529
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Do you know

530
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
What are the things that I find interesting

531
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
About Trump being elected is

532
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,336
Why do people are calling themselves dictator for life

533
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Like Prince

534
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
Yeah people who would have been checked

535
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,464
By our state department in the past

536
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,632
John Kerry's not allowed right now

537
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
People

538
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,544
People who would have probably use some of our soft power in order to be like

539
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
Hey hold on now

540
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,224
I don't know if that sort of thing is appropriate China and Saudi Arabia us

541
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,624
The weird things watching our foreign policy get dismantled your kind of like

542
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Evil before but

543
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,280
Well it's kind of a difference between

544
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't I actually don't

545
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Believe the

546
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
First part of the sentence

547
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:18,240
But I think that the perception is there a necessary evil

548
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,104
I think that right what you kind of come away from Obama's term with right

549
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,176
In terms of foreign policy a lot of things that are really f******

550
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,504
Unacceptable but the realities of the world we live in

551
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Necessitate

552
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
And now we're just an anarchy

553
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
Yep we're just basically in a foreign policy of

554
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Look Russia

555
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,888
You are probing to destroy our power

556
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Get it

557
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
But

558
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Our responses

559
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Come on guys

560
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,640
Come on guys on Thursday

561
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,736
That's right but they're not really targeted at right places

562
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:07,648
Circus like 18 guy they're wildly inappropriate

563
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
Russian oligarchs themselves

564
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Maybe

565
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Just maybe

566
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
Donald Trump

567
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
I think that what you look at

568
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
A really interesting article written by some Morgan talk about a little bit later on podcast in preparation

569
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Cancel that

570
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
No

571
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
And only on the periphery

572
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,112
Use making the argument long while back and he was an article

573
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Like 2009

574
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,000
About the United States

575
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,328
Right

576
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,472
The reason that there are

577
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,288
Destroyed you'd end up in a multipolar world

578
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,104
Order place where there was much more

579
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
Universal respect in power between Tundra

580
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,272
And the reality that he argued for is that

581
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
What would happen if the ABS

582
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Essence of us

583
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Power

584
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,904
Unipolarity is

585
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Chaos

586
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
And international Anarchy

587
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,072
Sure seems

588
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,400
I'm not sure if I believe all of his

589
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
His promises

590
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,264
But it does look based on things that you're talking about people saying I

591
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm just going to do whatever I want it seems like we're at the beginnings of what could be an era of

592
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
International

593
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
Anarchy

594
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
Some point down the road deciding

595
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,256
Power now being able to do that

596
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Is China

597
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Russian wouldn't

598
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
They don't have

599
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
The capability either because they're not

600
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,496
They're constantly speaking

601
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:03,104
Well they can only use they can only exercise their economic power over there

602
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
At the end of the day America has

603
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
All of the gun

604
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
Like essentially our military what our military is

605
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,904
All of the other major countries plus a million combines like

606
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
It's intense how much military

607
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,840
I honestly don't think there's any way we would use most

608
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Well the good news is

609
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
That's right

610
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,448
Is that now that we do have

611
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,032
All of this military power

612
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Hegemony

613
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,200
There's no possible way with our stable and wonderful government that we will

614
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
Use that in a negative possibility way there's no way

615
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
I still have

616
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
It all

617
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
After that I don't know

618
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
I never know

619
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
Clip where

620
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Alex makes his claim

621
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
So this way yet

622
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
The lawsuit

623
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,632
Defamation of character that

624
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Do you put towards

625
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,544
Nope

626
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
Is considered dark poop situation the black pope

627
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
In the day of and after the Charlottesville rally

628
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Alex

629
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
Kessler the guy who organized the unite the right rally

630
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Bulshit

631
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Could fly in his face

632
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:30,400
Alex's defense about why he's not guilty of the thing that he's being charged with

633
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Is that

634
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Onward

635
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
And they miss quoted him

636
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh no

637
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
And I don't

638
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Texas is going to fly

639
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Here's Warriors number settings

640
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,952
It was a bombshell connection

641
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
Charlottesville

642
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
Bombshell connection George Soros needs to be charged and arrested

643
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
Causing Charlottesville

644
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Marriott

645
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Is amazing real

646
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
Again the guy who writes respond

647
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
One he doesn't have any

648
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Aside from

649
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
Contract

650
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Now

651
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
I am also not a lawyer

652
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
I'm not even a lawsuit

653
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
At Georgetown

654
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
But

655
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Course

656
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
You got that contract

657
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Cigarette

658
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
No no no he's talking about

659
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Bead sucking

660
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Contracts that he found on 4chan that were

661
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Exact

662
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
No those are

663
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Fake

664
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,024
Those are absolutely not real

665
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,656
Fortunate

666
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
Talking a lot of lawsuit

667
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Things are real defense of like

668
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
They're suing me

669
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,248
George Soros

670
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,064
Cars supercharged first edition for causing

671
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,416
Cos Charlottesville chaos

672
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
That's weak

673
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
I don't know what I don't know the difference

674
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,328
They're I think it me modern parlance

675
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
The vernacular

676
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:41,216
The cause of law if you say you called charlotteville

677
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Charlottesville

678
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,080
What you're saying is that

679
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Woman was murdered

680
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Soros

681
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,320
Paid a MP4 to agitated that's what

682
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,720
Isn't that the distinction is opposed to just Charlottesville

683
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
Crazy s*** happened

684
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,496
Not Soros is responsible for the murder

685
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
No cuz I look at like

686
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
When we say Charlottesville

687
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
We're talking about

688
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,456
The math

689
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
So Charlottesville in Charlottesville chaos

690
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
I think are synonymous

691
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,136
You would think this is not a glaring omission

692
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
With the lawsuits

693
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Maybe very easy

694
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
This

695
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Open court

696
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
Alex Jones Talk Dirty about his wife

697
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
They've been frozen

698
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
Talk Dirty by his wife

699
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
How many throws it to commercial with Ted Nugent

700
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
It means we thought

701
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:19,007
This is Motor City

702
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
He should just be at the

703
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,927
Yeah

704
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Between them

705
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,631
It's their business whatever

706
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Probably but then like

707
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
We good

708
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,591
She's not she has other qualities

709
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,199
Nope she hasn't she's not street legal cuz she's got too much horsepower

710
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,527
Too much horsepower

711
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
The same car is me

712
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
And then he throws got rid of the Hellcat

713
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
I think he said he was going to

714
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Salad

715
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
You like this guy

716
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Cars me let's go to Ted Nugent

717
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,095
I meant he we use in the name of the song

718
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
Being like we got you globalist

719
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Strangle

720
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
Pretty smooth

721
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,055
Yeah if you gave him like

722
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
5 minutes

723
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
In between

724
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Like an hour

725
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,759
Solid music amazing

726
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Well

727
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
So that's his new wife

728
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
The next crappie talk about is old

729
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
She is deaf

730
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
When they run their mouth

731
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,559
What you're already doing

732
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
Outside of that Court

733
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
You don't do that

734
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Tom Brokaw say

735
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
You are

736
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
Literally every time he says the quote unalloyed racist

737
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
He has to Define it cuz he knows his audience has no idea what that mean

738
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
I'm also I remember eclipse of this in here but he's like

739
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,135
Statute of limitations, Brokaw

740
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,767
No that doesn't make sense because they're going to sue Tom Brokaw

741
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
Called to testify in the

742
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
Is Alex Jones a racist case

743
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
God we would crush it

744
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
I have a little bit of an archive

745
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,359
Circumstantial evidence

746
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Indicating

747
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Talk to try to distract

748
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
The fact that he's being sued by it's literally everybody

749
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,367
Talks about

750
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
That's not a good sign

751
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
Let's see where this guy

752
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Sure

753
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,215
Oceanside

754
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
Big Lots

755
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
They would be able to

756
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
That's that's

757
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
True

758
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,159
That's what also doesn't make any goddamn sense

759
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,463
That's an

760
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,791
Because the entirety of his

761
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
No that's not what

762
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,727
Because for the entirety of his career up till this point he's been denying

763
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Kelly was part Jewish

764
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Father was Jewish

765
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,359
By denying that his children were Jewish

766
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
Because the complaint that is anti-Semitic critics

767
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,967
Made against a witch again

768
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
They're wrong

769
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,599
But they they said that Alex Jones working for Israel and that Kelly was Jewish

770
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
And that made their kids Jewish and that meant that they could

771
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Have right of return Israel

772
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
When they committed all these Christ protection from

773
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
Committing a bunch of crimes

774
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Is real for Asylum or whatever

775
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Santa's crazy

776
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
But

777
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
The reason that that clip to me

778
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Is like

779
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
That's damning

780
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Is that

781
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
Fake uncomfortable laugh

782
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
He's covering

783
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
Him staying

784
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
I'd never thought of

785
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
You f****** thought about

786
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
All the years you've been f****** denying

787
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
That your family is

788
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Jewish roots

789
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,887
I mean wiwik theory about eggs

790
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
Exactly that

791
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
The right of return

792
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Crazy about it

793
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,919
It just would also apply to almost home

794
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
Decade

795
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
His career

796
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
There have been

797
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
People who have been harassing her

798
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,695
I couldn't find the clip of I forgot what episode was it on the show

799
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,023
There's a guy who called in whose like I've been inside your house

800
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:01,119
Yes I recall that and he was saying that his family was Jewish

801
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Retalix

802
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Specifically said

803
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
Really he says it over and over again

804
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,639
He has no nervous

805
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,711
Forever people have thrown it in his face and again

806
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
I need to keep repeating

807
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
They're wrong

808
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
Their argument is wrong and

809
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
Put the facts italics

810
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Has made of

811
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,535
Change now and is using Kelly's Heritage in order to protect

812
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
Himself from accusations that he's racist

813
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Memes

814
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:38,495
Crazy how much the way you feel about things changes when they become valuable

815
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,799
Yeah really crazy how that

816
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
Yeah it's real

817
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,663
Really really important until I get in your way

818
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Abandoned

819
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
That's pretty f*****

820
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,551
Crazy I just I always believed in Behavior

821
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
And this is a big

822
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,671
This is a really big one

823
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,767
Did he know his wife's Jewish heritage

824
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,703
They ended up getting married because of like common law marriage

825
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
Together for a really long time before they ended up getting married

826
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
And knowing that she's Jewish

827
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,711
Now or Never

828
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
I do not put

829
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
It seems it seems

830
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,439
Difficult

831
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,487
Not much of an a******

832
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Seems

833
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,583
Far more unlikely to me than him

834
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Being on

835
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Good terms

836
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,727
But you that you're forgetting

837
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
That

838
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
This is

839
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Years and years ago out

840
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,615
Alex Jones

841
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
You could sit down and listen

842
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
I think he would be

843
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087
You do a nice job of talking to the In-laws

844
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Fahrenheit

845
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
Brings us to the end of

846
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
Tuesday show is come

847
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:09,631
There are a couple interviews but they're not really important lady

848
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Pettibone was on the show

849
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
She was just on because Tommy Robinson mentioned her the day before cuz she was trying to interview him and got

850
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
What's up

851
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,783
Yeah it's not really a good interview at all I do, Robinson

852
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
Only knows people

853
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
By their fake synonyms

854
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,183
The interview

855
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
He just tries to be like

856
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
Impress her with his plight

857
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,727
I'm at Natalie Stranahan who again as a writer for Sputnik

858
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,103
But I just talk about how like

859
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Beaufort

860
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Follow the money

861
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
Call the money eventually get back to the Pope

862
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,807
That's the that's what I knew about the Watergate

863
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,927
Yeah that's why I fixin actually resigned is because the Pope

864
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,207
May 10th

865
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,535
You're right you get it I get it now

866
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
It's the Jesuits

867
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
The tourism

868
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Exactly

869
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
Tuesday and Wednesday Alex

870
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
I've gotten some

871
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Cider information

872
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
He's still complaining a lot about the lawsuit

873
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
There was bombings in Austin

874
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,807
You know that's true

875
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,367
From very reliable

876
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Cite sources

877
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,951
Some information about these bombings he wants to

878
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:49,215
Am I able to

879
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,455
Overwhelmed

880
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
Our security folks around phone

881
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:12,255
Smart bombs in the refrigerator

882
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,447
SOS

883
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
People can understand

884
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Never happen

885
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,175
Tom Brady

886
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
That was on Monday

887
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
The one on March 2nd

888
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,975
I'm going to give you the exclusive during the break

889
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
For the security guys you're the one talking about

890
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,215
I want to have him

891
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
Of the year

892
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
These are bombs cook

893
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
On

894
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
On the front porch.

895
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,559
On the porch

896
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,663
That last thing is fine

897
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,967
Did you order anything from Amazon

898
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:42,367
Don't touch it don't touch it

899
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
My friend

900
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
So Alex is saying that his law enforcement sources have given this information so he can report it and when the truth comes out

901
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,471
In the end

902
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,823
Yep and I will be like oh s***

903
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,639
Also if you are

904
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
Take more than 20

905
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
Visceral

906
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,783
I would I would assume that's all

907
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Slow cooker bomb

908
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Yeah absolutely

909
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
Dutch oven

910
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,975
The dude

911
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
So Alex

912
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,583
Restoration gear and it doesn't change over the course of the

913
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
The show The only things that he says

914
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
Secret information is

915
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
That they are a spa

916
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,639
Someone is making them on porches

917
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
Infrared which is

918
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Crazy

919
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Great idea

920
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
That seems

921
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
Unlikely

922
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,903
Because it kind of undue undoes all of the advantages that bombing

923
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
That

924
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,583
One of the reasons that you bomb things are so you don't have to be there very long

925
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
You generally

926
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Throw them

927
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Or

928
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Drop them somewhere and then run away

929
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
Do you like one of those

930
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,055
Suburbian

931
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,383
Cul-de-sacs for he's just out on the front porch

932
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
Goodnight little mcmansion house and he's just

933
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,247
Stirring up some

934
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Waving it

935
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,367
Hey you're mowing your lawn as a great day today

936
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
Right

937
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:25,023
Seems like that would put the would-be bomber in it

938
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,839
Vulnerable position

939
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Seems like

940
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,935
I don't know the reality

941
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,727
Situation I don't have fake sources

942
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
But I do

943
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
If you're going to bomb something

944
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
That is

945
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Not the plan

946
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,687
Like that's not you

947
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:48,063
If you if you Google how to make a bomb

948
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:53,183
And you found this result sit on someone's porch for 20 minutes

949
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Go to the next result for the first Google

950
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,655
It seems like a bad way to make a bomb

951
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
Let's

952
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727

00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,607
Not not to use or abused in any way

961
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:39,007

Also there been number of emails from Petoskey that have come out

One of them is going to read you here

1036
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,383
This is a email that Buttowski wrote

1037
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
Two bunch of

1038
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,687
Fox News producers

1039
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
Including Steve Doocy Gavin had in

1040
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,319
Ainsley Earnhardt and Brian Kilmeade regarding

1041
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Okay

1042
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
Regarding

1043
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,695
Richie was right

1044
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,791
If you have any questions about the story or more information needed call me at blank

1045
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Phone number

1046
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:48,191
I'm actually the one who's putting this together but as you know I keep my name out of things because I have no credibility

1047
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
One of the

1048
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,263
Conclusions to draw from this

1049
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
Is it the Russian

1050
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,823
Did not pack our computer system

1051
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
And steal emails and there was no collusion

1052
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,175
And the Russians

1053
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
So there's a bunch of

1054
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,039
Incriminating

1055
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,367
Yeah

1056
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
Very clear

1057
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
Episode

1058
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,231
This is Criminal

1059
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,511
They're so bad at

1060
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Yeah

1061
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
They should learn how to

1062
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,215
So I'm at this point they are the

1063
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,495
Bomb makers

1064
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,591
I just bought this lawsuit is going to be

1065
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
This is going to be

1066
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,991
It's very difficult for

1067
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
The people on the right

1068
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
To have to deal with

1069
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:39,903
Rodger stone is also in play with this cuz he pushed a lot of it on Alex's show

1070
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
But

1071
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
Here's the good news about

1072
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
That lawsuit

1073
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Is not

1074
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,559
About saying

1075
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Zip

1076
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,911
Seth Rich was killed because of the DNC

1077
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Or anything like that

1078
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
It's about specifically

1079
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
This conspiracy

1080
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Petoskey Malia Zimmerman

1081
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
Executives at Fox

1082
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Conspired

1083
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,503
Yeah that's what it's about yes so Alex knows that he can insinuate himself in it

1084
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Ambulatory

1085
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
Talk about the Seth rich

1086
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
There's a little bit here on this

1087
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
And then makes a weird

1088
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Admission

1089
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Wissports

1090
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
All right one of these days

1091
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:29,823
Keep track of options things

1092
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
And then you're like and now this next clip and I don't have an interruption

1093
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Interruption

1094
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:42,623
I disagree

1095
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,975
Huge Avenue like

1096
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,495
You Can Have This Dance

1097
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
It with with this lawsuit

1098
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,591
Because it is not about what fox

1099
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
News personality set

1100
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,455
Can they force and on-air apology

1101
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,367
Because I don't know I don't know is get a s*** ton of money

1102
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
As well as censorship and at all that kind

1103
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
Stop

1104
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,791
They can't send sure shut it off.

1105
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,351
I think they could make

1106
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:29,727
Like advertised ski or Malia Zimmerman make an apology or something like that

1107
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,127
An apology you want he want f****** handy and going on tonight

1108
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Literally

1109
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,271
But I think you could introduce into the court record and all that

1110
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
Story is a product of

1111
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,623
A conspiracy to

1112
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
Commits fraud and propaganda

1113
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
I don't know how helpful that is your right

1114
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
Yeah but

1115
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,303
Cuz that's what you need out of this

1116
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Lawsuit is you need

1117
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
These guys

1118
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
To go on Fox News

1119
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
I like

1120
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:07,103
Do you know what you know what I think it is this case could be a building block

1121
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
Because if they are successful in this lawsuit

1122
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
Then you can establish that the story is

1123
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
Is Bass

1124
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
In this conspiracy between epitaph

1125
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:21,183
You could probably bring

1126
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,999
Smaller suits against people who push the narrative

1127
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
Yap Ashley the people who worked at Fox

1128
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:32,447
You couldn't you couldn't

1129
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Sue them

1130
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,775
For damages or anything like that

1131
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
Sue them

1132
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
To retract

1133
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,639
Yeah or something like that

1134
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Did the story

1135
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Oh really

1136
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415

Alex talks about that lawsuit

1142
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,615
But only in as much as he knows he

1143
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:17,759
You can't be an right because of what the food is actually about the fake version of it he's presenting

1144
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,831
Which is a smart move

1145
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,159
How many makes a street

1146
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951

He's a sorcerer

1154
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,647
She said she can't work anymore after his son was killed

1155
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,695
Because of the murder

1156
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Coverage

1157
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,399
You're not investigating

1158
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
Is always the same as crazy

1159
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279

Flex Rosati

1167
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,559
We care more about solving your son's murder than who do lady

1168
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:11,167
So are you going to get mad when we investigated if I investigate I mean

1170
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Yeah

1171
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
I would be mad

1172
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
Give me

1173
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,799
Any sign of an investigation

1174
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
That they've done

1175
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
I don't have one

1176
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,551
Any like any even do any reviews

1177
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
Hold on just

1178
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,391
Hearsay Countess investigation at the

1179
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,975
Cuz it if so

1180
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,303
At this point where I work

1181
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
And on Tuesday evening there was

1182
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Special election

1183
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Pennsylvania

1184
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
18th District

1185
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Now

1186
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,151
Technically speaking

1187
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Democrat

1188
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
The humans

1189
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,759
Well cuddle Amazon

1190
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:01,855
The greatest candidate ever

1191
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
But what you take away from that

1192
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
The district going

1193
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
Plus 24 Trump

1194
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Before

1195
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
Numbers like that

1196
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,703
It matches up with

1197
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
I'm coming to the middle it's just the Republican light is the reason we got

1198
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
Republican heart

1199
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
That's the issue

1200
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,319
That's the situation

1201
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,647
This idea of neoliberalism being a f******

1202
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
Yeah

1203
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
It's just

1204
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Republicanism

1205
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
30 years ago

1206
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
Neoliberalism

1207
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
Republicanism isn't

1208
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
I don't want to I don't necessarily want to engage with that cuz it's irrelevant

1209
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
To the matter at hand

1210
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,311
I don't care I don't live in Pennsylvania

1211
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,359
Conor lamb supporter

1212
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,687
Ferret necessarily also Scott Adams

1213
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,503
End up coming on the show today

1214
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,855
Here I can listen to it but it is funny cuz Alex keeps calling him Gilbert

1215
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
Accidentally

1216
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,815
He doesn't like four times

1217
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,143
Scott Adams argument Conor lamb 12

1218
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Because he is the person who run

1219
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,215
Voters most of trump

1220
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Doesn't

1221
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Track

1222
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,967
Could ever have run

1223
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
Seems to be a trend

1224
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Pennsylvania election

1225
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Spoiler alert

1226
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
The Democrats stole it

1227
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
Congressional election

1228
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Nope

1229
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,039
That's an argument that he keeps making is that like

1230
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
The Democrats

1231
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,255
And that makes it right

1232
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,559
Disenfranchised did not want to come out and vote

1233
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Which is a stupid

1234
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,471
Would feel threatened the more likely they are to come out

1235
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,359
Like every report on all of that s*** was like

1236
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Yeah yeah

1237
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,967
And when he says he's up 10 or whatever

1238
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Predictions were up

1239
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,831
Parrot

1240
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,647
Is the 2016 hebraic

1241
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,951
You made a three-point switch

1242
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Democrats

1243
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
Obviously

1244
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
Look up

1245
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,471
Under smiley face establishment

1246
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,751
Attack is appearance

1247
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
Sunfolding

1248
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,951
Call Sandra neighbor

1249
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
This

1250
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,959
You think cuz everybody saying

1251
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
Essentially is that if you ever have a close rate

1252
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:36,383
That should

1253
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
You saw the movie Black Sheep

1254
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
What

1255
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,111
Chris Farley and

1256
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,791
This old white lady goes crazy

1257
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
I mean

1258
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
If you really want to

1259
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,239
Didn't get enough into policy

1260
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,287
Really at this point

1261
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
I don't know who to be rude

1262
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
FairPoint what you're talking about cuz it's sucking stew

1263
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
Stupid and it's just

1264
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Like

1265
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:18,623
If the if the Republican 640 Voice vote

1266
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
He would have been like

1267
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:26,047
Congratulations on defeating the Democratic

1268
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,143
This is true

1269
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,239
2.0 is what this is

1270
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
At the end there what he says that

1271
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
More votes

1272
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
Forecast that registered voters

1273
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,431
Liking

1274
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:47,551
You can trace this back to article on a website called Daily World update

1275
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
Got to be a bad website

1276
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
It's

1277
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,183
Political trolling

1278
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
Tire website

1279
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,791
It's a completely fake website

1280
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:04,191
Voting in the names of dead

1281
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:11,103
Yeah

1282
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:20,063
People talking about how like

1283
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
Everybody says it's

1284
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,623
The illegals it's not

1285
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
It's an interesting art

1286
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
Homeless

1287
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,631
But he's had to move on because of the Lycans

1288
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:37,215
Toxicity of these hearings about Crisco Bashas

1289
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
His voter

1290
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Inquiry

1291
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,639
Where do you mean the fact that I was just f******

1292
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,687
Where they were analyzing people's names

1293
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:50,527
To see if they were Anglo

1294
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,415
But that is that is unscientific realizes enough

1295
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
I got a twist

1296
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,975
Narrative a little bit

1297
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Hobos

1298
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
Yeah it was hobos

1299
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:06,143
Have the legal right to vote they get them a bunch of whiskey

1300
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,471
I need stumbling drunk to voting places

1301
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495

Boat and the drunk but have we considered adding the drug for how much does the drug boats

1305
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Swinging election

1306
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
It's not real

1307
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,415
Is all nonsense I want that put into demographic

1308
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,975
Do you want

1309
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
I think a lot of you ever get elected for everything

1310
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:40,191
Because of the hobo pie like one of the unfortunate things you're going to run political career and aspirations

1311
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,639
Wow that's going to be a part of it another part is that a lot of the times

1312
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
You're going to run into

1313
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Florida felonies

1314
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
In the home

1315
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,247
Community in the hobo

1316
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,319
They don't have the right to vote

1317
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,879
Yeah you're going to run into a lot of

1318
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:03,743
People enthusiastically on your side without right

1319
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Our justice system is

1320
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
I mean

1321
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
You can only

1322
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:15,263
Really be on drugs and loiter for so long before you get a trumped-up charge of something

1323
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,663
Yeah just have a severe mental illness and have been kicked out because Ray

1324
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,199
Reagan destroyed the

1325
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,783
If you think Reagan was a good president

1326
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,087
F*** off for speaking people with mental illness

1327
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
At this point

1328
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
I just wanted to show

1329
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
On a Wednesday

1330
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
Alex Jones tattoos

1331
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,167
Boy it's tough to figure out who's the worst

1332
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,263
It's either first or second worst guests of the day

1333
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,847
He's just boring

1334
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:54,175
Rodger Stone

1335
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
Yeah if you know what

1336
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
This stuff he's saying is like

1337
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Good

1338
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
But he's

1339
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
So boring

1340
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,439
Yeah he's he's a dick

1341
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
Kind of boring

1342
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,303
He sounds analytical but what he saying is just nonsense

1343
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,887
He's like we don't have to worry about these kids walking out of their schools

1344
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,935
The protest gun

1345
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
Rod laws

1346
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,239
Because of the kids

1347
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Is are the stupidest

1348
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,055
People in the society

1349
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
Like

1350
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,895
Seem like it

1351
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,919
Scott Adams

1352
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Creator of Dilbert

1353
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
Albert Albert

1354
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,295
The reason they're protesting is

1355
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
They don't want to get shot at school

1356
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
Seems like that's a smart move

1357
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,719
So everybody still.

1358
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
Creating cat

1359
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,839
He was actually my favorite character

1360
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
Oh okay

1361
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
Play squeeze

1362
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
If I squeeze

1363
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,287
All right don't forget that song

1364
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
The two top

1365
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127

1366
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,943

1367
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,063

Still around

1370
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Hasn't been around for awhile it's been a long time again

1371
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
The show

1372
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:21,983
When we last met most black-faced with reverence

1373
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Right

1374
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
Yep

1375
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,079
Levi's

1376
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,407
Created the definitely

1377
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
Not racist

1378
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
Not misogynistic

1379
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Fraternity

1380
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
The proud boys

1381
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,623
The Fraternal Knight of The Proud boys

01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:49,375
Material has been going around as aljoeson to

1385
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
You know that right

1386
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
I've heard that

1387
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
Back then

1388
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,055
He was working for Rebel media right

1389
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,407
You had a show on Rebel media

1390
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
And I believe he

1391
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,527
Lessons that started working for

1392
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:13,183
How do you spell

1393
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,511
Media

1394
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,631
He had a Gavin McGinnis there but I believe that his sense and dead

1395
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:28,031
Another show that I believe is just on YouTube

1396
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Get this it's called

1397
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,871
Get off my lawn

1398
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,735
These are the least we lose

1399
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,111
People in the world

1400
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,511
Jeff McInnis sucks

1401
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
We are leaving

1402
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
Get off my lawn

1403
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,631
Show time

1404
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,703
Just decided to do like with our ability

1405
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,823
Intelligence just decided to do an episode where we were

1406
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,127
Intentionally antagonistic and racist

1407
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,967
I bet we get a new followers

1408
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:13,855
I agree I think you're right they would quickly learn like

1409
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
Some of our fans be like

1410
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,671
That was not worth it

1411
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
Never do something like that

1412
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,815
It's very very easy to attract followers with your grief

1413
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,095
Here's what we should do

1414
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,655
Weasel

1415
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,215
We should call our show get on my

1416
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,031
And then the next

1417
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,615
Turn off with get on my lawn

1418
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,687
Let's not even get off my lawn

1419
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,991
The next recommended video will the

1420
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Get on my lawn

1421
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
What's the opposite

1422
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
Get on my yard

1423
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Get off my

1424
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,975
Yard on my

1425
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:57,375
The yard of my yard on my lawn

1426
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:03,519
Hit a couple dingers on my lawn so Kevin McGinest sucks

1427
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,311
Yeah he's the worst

1428
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
Listen to

1429
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Butter

1430
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,967
It's worth it on on some level

1431
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,807
Will you start advice

1432
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Quickly got

1433
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,047
Right because of of course

1434
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Yeah

1435
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,167
Because he hired people who were like

1436
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,239
And this really weird

1437
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,311
Fairly hostile abusive male-dominated work

1438
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
Place would be much

1439
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359
More fun with

1440
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
That guy

1441
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,343
Telling me in the chat room

1442
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,879
Don't care about that is

1443
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:55,999
Interesting trivia but certainly does not explain his celebrity

1444
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,071
You were too toxic

1445
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Mail

1446
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,631
To work at a time

1447
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Typically masculine play

1448
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
Early

1449
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,959
Yeah

1450
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,727
So

1451
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
That's a good one

1452
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,311
Property

1453
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591

01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Return to do a home improvement show

1456
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,271
I got you

1457
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,343
Here's the first clip

1458
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,439
So Alex introduces Gavin McInnes

1459
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,999
He's the host of the show get off my lawn

1460
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,535
And I almost did

01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
It's so hockey still on the nose for like

1462
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,311
I'm f****** pissed off white

1463
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
So stupid

1464
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,407
Psychic reading

1465
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,479
What's on your mind

1466
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,527
And then there's a long pause

1467
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,831
And like your mic wasn't gone

1468
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
So go to the middle of a ramp

1469
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,415
Bright

1470
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,023
So he's talking you here if you see his mouth moving but no audio

1471
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,887
Reanimated as well just

1472
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:16,896

1479
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
Songs

01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Anyway

1481
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
Jordan

1482
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:45,312
I'm I'm only engaging with all this because I also don't want to listen to get it

1483
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,872
I know he has to

1484
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
How would you

1485
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:59,648
That I feel like that's the worst possible way for you to try and make more time

1486
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,696
Didn't want to talk about

1487
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
Fair enough

1488
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
No you're not wrong

1489
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:08,864
It is a bad call back for the particular situation where get off my lawn

1490
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Is introduced

1491
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
Alex says what's on your mind

1492
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
Big silent

1493
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,824
Cabins in the middle of a raincoat and Alex tells him

1494
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
Hey man

1495
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
We didn't have the mic on

1496
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Start it over

01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:28,832
Cuz nothing is more genuine then restarting erase started over

1498
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
Amazon.com

1499
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
But I can't stop thinking about today

1500
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,744
George Soros

1501
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,048
Comedian named Atlee

I know that he led the Nazis

1506
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,800
Two Jewish homes where they were that exterminator

1507
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:55,200
60 minutes

1508
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
However

Anti globalist Duchess Alan dershowitz Dennis Prager bench

1510
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,744
All of these

1511
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,280
They are not

1512
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
You see

1513
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,864
And it's amazing the pretzel

1514
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,680
If they can twist their own logic

1515
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,728
When it comes to this ridiculous

1516
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,008
Nazi allegation

1517
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,288
So

1518
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,592
We have a very interesting start

1519
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
To the interview

1520
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,664
There's one thing

1521
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Always

1522
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
Say

1523
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,016
And that is that the Jews are the

1524
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
Right that's a part of Holocaust

1525
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:42,560
Very large part of the Holocaust denial community

1526
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:48,960
Happened

1527
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:55,872
Gavin is really

1528
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
He's triggered

1529
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
YouTube triggered little buffer

1530
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,760
Baby because his friends are being called Nazis

1531
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,576
And it turns out that George Soros

1532
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
No one wants

1533
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,184
Friends

1534
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,584
Things that aren't true that I keep saying about him and Alex

1535
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
It's not

1536
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,424
It's very.

1537
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,960
I think it's obviously the

1538
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,592
Yep

1539
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Historically

1540
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
They loved

1541
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,712
There is never been

1542
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,248
A huge issue with the Cavs

1543
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,272
Bat cat

1544
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,648
Conover over and over again with George Soros

1545
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
Not sure

1546
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
Anyways

1547
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
He wasn't

1548
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,096
Actively killing juice

1549
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,656
Are you going

1550
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,704
The camps along with his

1551
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,240
He was in hiding

1552
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,520
What's 0

1553
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,336
What's the name what's the murder

1554
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
No it's still not the Nazi they described

1555
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Certainly

1556
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Knox

1557
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,624
The collaborator is Alex Jones being able to get away because

1558
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,464
He knows that sources never going to sue him for that Grant like that

1559
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
It's just a s*** game

1560
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
You playing at all it is is

1561
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
Trying to

1562
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,240
We have to deal with the f****** have to deal with right up.

1563
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,528
Comedian it's like

1564
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
So many of these right

1565
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
Wing guys you can

1566
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,136
Can find them at an open

1567
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,440
Your

1568
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
And you did

1569
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
Get white

1570
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:53,888
Hmm. He said the reason that he never succeeded

1571
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
When I was listening to this is famous for people who are not at all explosive

1572
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,760
When I was listening to this all I wanted like I can't

1573
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,040
Writing drafts

1574
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
Tweet I never sent out

1575
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,856
But they were just like

1576
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,928
Gavin McInnes a straight-up on Infowars right now

1577
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
B that would

1578
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,744
Open mic

1579
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,024
Exactly

1580
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Did like

1581
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,584
Doing comedy

1582
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
But he's doing it

1583
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,680
New series that I've been working out

1584
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,240
Specific

1585
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,288
Passing the last couple days

1586
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Shrek

1587
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
I also cuz you've been drinking

1588
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,920
I haven't know I don't like that dessert beer

1589
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,600
I believe

1590
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Your people

1591
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
The Jews

1592
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,000
Your Stouts

1593
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,840
I believe the people like them again

1594
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:00,448
They present themselves as doing comedy and political commentators

1595
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,496
With the awareness that they're bad at

1596
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Raynaud's

1597
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,080
It's so anytime their political opinions

1598
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
Negotiating be like

1599
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,736
Seriously

1600
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
Political commentator

1601
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
I'm trying to make you think

1602
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,856
It wasn't supposed to be funny

1603
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,672
So he play they're trying to play The Line

1604
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,720
Yeah and it's really sad

1605
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,048
It's fun on episode of little bit

1606
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,608
Because you got Alex Jones and him doing the two-man Act

1607
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Alex

1608
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,424
The worst two-man Act

1609
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Doesn't

1610
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,008
Improv training

1611
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
No you can't go along with things

1612
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,336
Every kind of winds B

1613
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
A little bit along the way

1614
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:45,504
Training for what he's doing

1615
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
Don't negate the premise

1616
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,904
Really understand what

1617
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Premise

1618
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
Is generally

1619
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,744
He that he doesn't realize

1620
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
Anyting

1621
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,304
So at this point

1622
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,704
About George Soros

1623
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,360
How do I say I actually have video

1624
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,408
Pair that shows the George Soros

1625
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:19,808
This is everything

1626
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,368
You know this is Alex Jones

1627
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,416
Like here's my demonstration

1628
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:29,280
The George Soros

1629
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,048
But

1630
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,864
When we get to the end of this it will make clear

1631
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,168
He is actually proving that he is committing

1632
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,448
Slander

1633
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,728
Did he say first

1634
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
Does anybody like

1635
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
Impressions

1636
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,336
No you don't do that and then did he say

1637
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
Here's what

1638
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
I think

1639
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,176
Soros would sound like

1640
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
If you were in

1641
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,504
Who is Blaze

1642
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
I mean

1643
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
This is just like

1644
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
One of the things

1645
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,392
Coming back from break

1646
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,208
Sometimes commercials in

1647
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Is this

1648
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,912
McGinnis was talking about where Soros

1649
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,216
Ashamed at all

1650
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,592
Real quick before this video starts

1651
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,128
It's very clear that

1652
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,664
But Alex says

1653
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,200
He rounded up

1654
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,480
A rounded them up

1655
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,784
So that's what this video clip is going to prove

1656
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,552
Intex

1657
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
In Texas

1658
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
Parlance

1659
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
That mean

1660
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
He wrote them up

1661
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
And then

1662
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
Put them in the

1663
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:38,400
If the claim that the

1664
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,728
Representative

1665
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,384
Come look at the background George Soros is one of those people

1666
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,784
I understand that you went out with this protector of yours or that

1667
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,184
You were robbed is adopted.

1668
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,984
With a difficult

1669
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,776
Right there already I have to pause it

1670
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,824
Because Alex is selectively edited it

1671
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,848
He's not app

1672
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,384
Interview

1673
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,688
Asking if it was difficult

1674
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
You do it

1675
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,016
Is difficulties asking if it was difficult

1676
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:31,648
If you are one of your many new listeners first off thank you

1677
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,952
Second refer back to

1678
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,232
All of our episodes

1679
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:41,632
Where is not enough

1680
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,448
Reticulated

1681
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,288
About

1682
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
From 60 minutes

1683
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
He's asking him

1684
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
If

1685
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,384
Do you wear it like

1686
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
Awareness

1687
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:57,504
Was difficult for him as he got older

1688
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,296
The reason is because

1689
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,160
If I didn't do it someone else would have done it

1690
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
What are you saying by that is

1691
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,280
I would like to live they were already gone

1692
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,352
The Camp's I didn't do it someone else would have done it

1693
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,912
Even says in the interview

1694
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
Pretty clearly

1695
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,800
I didn't go along with him all that off and it was a very occasional

1696
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:31,040
Do you think George soros-funded the neo-nazis do March 10th

1697
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
Find out

1698
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,368
It would be interesting to find out

1699
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:40,256
That's from a vice the vice special about Charlottesville rally

1700
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:46,400
Listen to Reba first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones

1701
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:52,288
Is there anyone George Soros Nazi collaborator

1702
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:56,384
From the information for

1703
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
It's Alex

1704
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Jones

1705
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
So it must part in there it just makes it

1706
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,088
A package

1707
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:09,440
Improve any of the stuff he says it has nothing to do with him

1708
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:13,024
I just stopped about the best time of my life

1709
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,864
In there

1710
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Why are we all

1711
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,776
You said that I was creating a scare clip I would definitely put just

1712
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
That

1713
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,104
And then maybe like a little bumper of like

1714
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,896
So you worked with another

1715
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
Please and then

1716
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,224
Cut it and then if he likes

1717
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
And then

1718
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:39,392
When he was talking about it being the best time of his life he was referring to being that age

1719
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,184
And being

1720
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,464
Somewhat

1721
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,000
Free given that

1722
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
Sacrifice

1723
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
Is the father

1724
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,096
And of course he was a huge Green Day

1725
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,376
Yes absolutely

1726
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,216
Holocaust

1727
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:58,080
A very interesting song But at the end

1728
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Still not right

1729
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:05,504
Play God's R Us have the time

1730
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:15,232
About how liberal

1731
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,280
Just

1732
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:21,376
And then it's just that they're going

1733
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:24,704
Brothers company

1734
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:30,592
Yeah it's a bizarre thing I'm convinced his daddy issues in all these children All The Children of Divorce

1735
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:36,224
Dematic

1736
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,832
Or Louis Farrakhan Orlando

1737
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,624
Or basically all of Islam

1738
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,928
I don't mind it then so they're not about ideas

1739
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,464
Who's Stanley idea

1740
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
Their dad

1741
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,888
Dealing with petulant children

1742
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,936
Who are still butthurt

1743
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,752
About a divorce than 50% of the country

1744
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,056
Ghost real grow up baby

1745
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:09,248
The black box out of juice

1746
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,576
That's a bad b****

1747
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:16,160
That's not analysis that's not interesting that's not

1748
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,464
Political even socially

1749
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:22,304
Relevant

1750
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,912
Premise correctly

1751
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,728
We're mad that

1752
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,264
He's an anti-semite

1753
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
Because he looks

1754
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Sly car.

1755
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
It looks like

1756
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
Daddy Yankee

1757
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:44,320
Daddy I'm mad at you Daddy does not look like my dad

1758
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,856
Is it just cuz he's white

1759
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,160
Is it just cuz we're mad that

1760
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,952
We have white fathers

1761
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,072
Yeah I think that's what he's talking about

1762
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,608
Also I want

1763
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,400
I'm just going to give you a little bit of advice

1764
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Comedies in

1765
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
Pacifist

1766
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,776
Well there's that also in creativity

1767
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,312
Also in

1768
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,104
Like making your premise makes

1769
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,992
Plant right things that are important absolutely

1770
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,040
I would I would say

1771
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Personally

1772
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
Find

1773
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,672
Semitism wherever it exists

1774
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,952
Offensive

1775
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:24,768
I'm not a huge

1776
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,072
I'm not those people are not

1777
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Target

1778
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,632
Of mine necessarily

1779
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:32,448
Specifically because we doing Alex Jones

1780
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,520
But that doesn't mean that they're off the hook

1781
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:39,360
I believe whenever Alex Jones went over to Farrakhan we made it very clear that

1782
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,432
The reason they got a lot because they're both

1783
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:47,808
I can I can be against Israel's

1784
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,088
And at the same time

1785
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,112
Against

1786
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,208
I also met our parents are super liberal

1787
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,912
And I'm still not mad at you cuz you look at my dad cuz he looked like my dad

1788
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:06,496
We come from very different backgrounds

1789
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,824
Neither are mad

1790
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
Italics because of our dad

1791
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,248
My parents Tommy do stand up for the very first time

1792
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,320
Did not have the courage to do Michael

1793
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,928
To do it and then I was advised by

1794
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,328
The rest of my family everybody

1795
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
Don't see the carpet in front of your

1796
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:38,240
Ben McGinnis

1797
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,848
Is the rest of this stupid and

1798
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,640
Analysis

1799
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:50,528
You were wrong about this. Two years ago

1800
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:54,624
They go ask you why do you have so many kids after family in front of me

1801
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,696
Sounds like a stripper

1802
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,496
It's usually weird white male

1803
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:14,080
We're

1804
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,624
I can explain it most I'm not racist

1805
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
The spot you can get about

1806
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,952
Kind of but I can explain

1807
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
Everyone hates

1808
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
You

1809
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
Giraffe

1810
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,144
No one's mad that you have a family

1811
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
People yelling

1812
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,472
He didn't you lose your kids

1813
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,008
They're trying to hurt

1814
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,104
Everyone

1815
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,944
You public discourse

1816
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,248
I mean the enemy of

1817
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,040
Decency

1818
01:36:55,296 --> 01:37:01,184
He talks about how like everyone keeps sending me messages on

1819
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,232
Twitter and all over the place

1820
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
About like

1821
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,584
They want to attack my marriage you're going to get divorced

1822
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,424
What about it

1823
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:15,008
It's not about life

1824
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,312
Attacking the family are attacking

1825
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,592
Your family

1826
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:21,408
It's using your family to attack

1827
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,456
You because we hate

1828
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,784

1832
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
It's not Twitter people

1833
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
First

1834
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
It's people it's

1835
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488

It's always

1839
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,168
Trying

To go to Aldi

1841
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496

1845
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,000
Always saying he doesn't

1846
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,792
People but

1847
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
Old white women

1848
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
People hate

1849
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:17,216
Because he has a family

1850
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
The last

1851
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
Their religion

1888
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:56,800
How the whites are the best as really struggling to find a reason I had to jump in there

1889
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,080
Like

1890
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,872
Chauvinist

1891
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
Tremors

1892
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,928
And I'll say at a time

1893
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,720
Stupid

1894
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
F******

1895
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,632
Craziest things I've ever heard in my life

1896
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
This is legitimate Lee crazier than black

1897
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,496
Text face with Reverend

1898
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
Alright I'm in

1899
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:32,896
Well those people

1900
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Let's talk about ideas

1901
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:38,784
So your concern is overpopulation

1902
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,880
Set the American citizens that they tend to have a population

1903
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,672
It's stationary or going down

1904
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:50,048
Operation is going up

1905
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,096
So you must then

1906
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:56,704
Here's why your idea is flawed those people already exist

1907
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,568
It turns out it's a great idea

1908
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:05,664
When people talk about overpopulation generally what they're talking about

1909
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:11,040
The big picture as opposed to 20 people over here 50 people over here

1910
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,088
So you're already

1911
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,368
Little

1912
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,672
He was talking about

1913
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
Create more kids shockingly

1914
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,048
That's about to come up

1915
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,352
If you're against overpopulation

1916
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
You know we love them

1917
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,960
Can you look at Time Magazine and they'll have one month it'll say

1918
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,800
Don't have babies we have too many babies in the picture

1919
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,592
And then the next week it will say

1920
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,920
The new face of America

1921
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
You know it's f****** weird to me

1922
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
But there is an actual organization

1923
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,296
Call the voluntary human extinction

1924
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,320
Can movement

1925
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,624
I guess an actual group

1926
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
That exist

1927
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,672
Find their website

1928
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,696
Body image

1929
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:53,024
Friend friend

1930
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,792
Heart

1931
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:57,376
Voluntary like pledge of I will not have kids

1932
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,912
We don't deserve to

1933
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,192
I continue to live on this planet

1934
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
WhatsApp never mentioned them

1935
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,264
And they are real

1936
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,104
I just realized that I like

1937
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,384
That's because

1938
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,176
They might have a legitimate

1939
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:15,040
Tough to argue

1940
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,344
And the phrase

1941
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,672
Then the white man came and not be like

1942
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,000
It's about to happen that's even true for like

1943
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Animal King

1944
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,328
Yeah

1945
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
That's not even

1946
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:32,192
Just threw for cumin

1947
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,800
No I mean the white man right now there's no more squirrels

1948
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:48,064
You're all about identity politics and the individual

1949
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,600
Wehrenberg

1950
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,208
And what's kind of fun about that is

1951
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,768
Is not to breed and not have families

1952
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,328
Our stupid idea is to breed like rats

1953
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,376
And they are going to be at

1954
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,168
Our children

1955
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:07,776
Are not going to have to deal with these annoying childless lesbian feminist

1956
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:14,176
Because they're all going to be gone through the dodo bird

1957
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,880
Like

1958
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
That's Alex not knowing how to play the game

1959
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
Like

1960
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:26,976
That's

1961
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,280
He's doing a bit

1962
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:32,352
Probably expressing things that are lucky

1963
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
Pretty close to his heart

1964
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
But at the same time

1965
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,984
He's doing something that he thinks is funny

1966
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,312
He thinks that's funny he's doing

1967
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
Turn on the

1968
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
You know what they say

1969
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
Are good for you

1970
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,712
And then the next week

1971
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:51,040
They say they got too much cholesterol

1972
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,832
Ugly eggs in Irvine

1973
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,112
And you know I love whites

1974
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:58,976
And let me tell you brown eggs are good

1975
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,376
Is that at the end there that is

1976
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,168
Real

1977
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
A sentence that he says

1978
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,240
If you just unpacked the idea that

1979
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,288
Children won't

1980
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,824
Have to deal with these

1981
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,664
Lesbian feminist dodo bird

1982
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,200
Here's a cure for the

1983
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,016
Various assumptions that underlie the

1984
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
1

1985
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,344
Yes gay people

1986
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
Give birth

1987
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
Two gay kids

1988
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Exclusive

1989
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:32,000
That's the only way that happens unless

1990
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,024
Cuz they are gay

1991
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,352
That is part of his premise

1992
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,472
Lesbian feminist

1993
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,240
Arnot

1994
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
Going to have kids

1995
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,288
Therefore

1996
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:50,176
People who have the same beliefs as them

1997
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Razor

1998
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Feathers

1999
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:55,552
Not if there's anything from the

2000
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,624
High schoolers have react

2001
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,928
It's that

2002
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,000
That ideology is going to die out

2003
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,024
Right

2004
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:10,144
On some level I hope it doesn't because it's snow

2005
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,448
It's so amazing

2006
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
That's it

2007
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,776
I could write

2008
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,824
Probably a 10-page paper

2009
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
Alone

2010
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,408
Just because of the the various peace

2011
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
Like what I just said.

2012
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
He

2013
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,552
Seems to be representing the position that

2014
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,088
Gay parents give birth

2015
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:29,856
The gay children

2016
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,160
4

2017
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:32,928
Feminist

2018
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,232
Parents give birth families children

2019
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,512
Otherwise now

2020
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:41,376
Let me hear about that first one

2021
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:47,776
And then we'll go through their his ideology is that because gay people

2022
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,800
Call can't reproduce

2023
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
Deuce which he thinks is a thing

2024
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:59,296
Prong of this

2025
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
Is this

2026
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,856
Weird f****** bullies

2027
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,648
I believe that he's a thousand

2028
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,440
Witches to invade Russia

2029
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
Yelp

2030
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
Somehow that makes more sense

2031
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,656
He's presenting

2032
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,448
These lesbian

2033
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
Feminist

2034
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,264
But he's so annoyed by

2035
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
Haven't

2036
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:27,200
Is the first time that they have been grumpy white males

2037
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:27,968
Eden vet

2038
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,248
They're not having kids

2039
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,272
So it'll be a Jew

2040
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
Phenomenon

2041
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:32,576
4

2042
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,856
2018

2043
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,160
Grumpy white dudes to have to put up with

2044
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:40,512
Pretending that the Isle of Lesbos wasn't thinking

2045
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,048
Bacon grease in history

2046
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
Like VIP

2047
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:48,192
Bright

2048
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:52,544
Throughout the entirety of our history or the idea of women's rights has

2049
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,128
Existed stage of matrilineal societies in in

2050
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,920
It whatever

2051
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,224
Never an issue in the past so

2052
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
Crazy Easter

2053
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,296
I thought Wonder Woman that died out

2054
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,880
Triggered by

2055
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
Having

2056
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,952
Economy in authority

2057
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,232
Executive

2058
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,256
Create

2059
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,280
Perception

2060
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Current

2061
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
Sing

2062
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,448
Just now

2063
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,496
Being like on out

2064
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:23,520
You could have

2065
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
Two very right-wing

2066
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,592
Parents who end up giving

2067
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616
2A

2068
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:31,968
Childless feminist lesbian that will really piss you off

2069
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,296
Because the philosophy is not

2070
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,832
Genetic

2071
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,648
Then the third prong is

2072
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,184
What really seems

2073
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,952
To be pissing him off

2074
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,232
That's what you brought up

2075
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,280
And that if he's mad that

2076
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,328
White people who could reproduce

2077
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
I think that's really what's more

2078
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,424
Behind

2079
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:55,008
Derek did you keep talking about how like it's all these weird gay white

2080
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,032
Evoland

2081
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:58,336
You know he says we breed like rabbits

2082
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,872
You guys don't breathe

2083
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,664
Actors that we breed like rats with

2084
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,200
Which is yeah

2085
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,992
Put

2086
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,040
Think his worldview

2087
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
There's a part of him

2088
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,344
Pissed off

2089
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,464
Well that is

2090
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,744
Reason number one

2091
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
That you see those

2092
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,072
Gay people aren't allowed to adopt

2093
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,888
Which

2094
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,192
Adopt

2095
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,496
No not which is they're going to raise them gay

2096
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,288
Ghostbusters

2097
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:33,664
My mind didn't go to that is I felt like that is such an old id

2098
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,712
Exactly

2099
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,576
Their concept is

2100
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,648
So if we allow gay people to raise joke

2101
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,976
That means more gay people

2102
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:51,840
Right and if we allow them to have children they're going to raise

2103
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,632
Like their concept

2104
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,424
Of sexuality is

2105
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
Is genetic

2106
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:01,312
Kind of like we can get rid of it in one generation

2107
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,616
Exactly just ostracized

2108
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,664
No it's it's good

2109
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,368
Like all of this all of this

2110
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,392
Concept

2111
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,696
Is built on the idea of

2112
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,720
Jeanette

2113
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,280
And it all goes back

2114
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,584
It goes back to

2115
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,608
Pieology

2116
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,888
Goes back to

2117
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
Play Black

2118
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,032
Legos all the way f****** back

2119
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,896
God damn I mean if you want to go back to the

2120
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,176
You can enslave these

2121
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:42,016
The f****** Canaanites like you can do all of this s***

2122
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
Genetically

2123
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,600
You are allowed

2124
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:52,512
I don't disagree with you at all but I realized just at this second we are almost two hours into this

2125
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:55,584
Alright let's do it

2126
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,912
Absolutely

2127
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,704
Stretch things out to some extent

2128
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,496
And this next clip isn't

2129
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,264
Going to help but

2130
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,288
AOL

2131
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,152
Why are lesbian so uptight

2132
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:13,248
I'm out

2133
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:17,088
But I can't help but notice minerals dancing around

2134
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:22,208
Lesbians are always Grumpy in ill-fitting denim pants

2135
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:26,560
Male gaze get laid more in getting late apparently makes you happy

2136
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:30,400
I want to stop real quick the only thing

2137
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:36,288
Buckingham

2138
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:40,640
Forever actually interesting about that

2139
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
Exactly

2140
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
02

2141
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,784
You know that great analysis

2142
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,600
He cries because there's no

2143
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,624
Little lesbian

2144
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,472
.

2145
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,200
How many men are married

2146
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,552
Yeah you always used to call it

2147
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,856
College lesbians

2148
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,184
And it's easy to be bisexual when you're young and gorgeous

2149
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,000
And all you got to do is make out with another hot chick

2150
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:32,864
Lesbian

2151
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,144
That's

2152
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,424
Rock and roll

2153
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:38,752
And the numbers dwindle

2154
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,288
What is the tiny

2155
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,824
Population is Tiny

2156
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Control

2157
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,248
Which of the political narrative why are entitled elections

2158
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:56,672
2 something is irrelevant as gay marriage

2159
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:01,280
Because she's a lesbian

2160
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
That's fun

2161
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:13,824
Cuz you know what at the same time

2162
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,128
You're getting so mad about this

2163
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:18,176
And I understand

2164
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
Rhetoric

2165
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,040
But he thinks he's doing, Dateline

2166
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:28,928
He's trying to give at least trying to piss people off

2167
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
Like that

2168
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,256
Gavin McInnes

2169
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
Probably has quite

2170
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:39,168
Parachute when they kicked him out of Vice

2171
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,312
Amy wears nice suits

2172
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,848
Politically

2173
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,408
Going to start building a bond

2174
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:50,944
Politico

2175
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Politico

2176
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,368
It's just the worst analysis of any

2177
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Comedy presented as

2178
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:08,864
Leben a late 80s mid-eighties Andrew Dice Clay routine

2179
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,168
Absolute

2180
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
Project

2181
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:17,312
Absolutely being presented straight-faced

2182
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,872
Cuz if you did that

2183
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,664
You did that at a comedy club

2184
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,456
No

2185
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,760
No this is this is

2186
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,296
Literally like

2187
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:32,160
What I just said

2188
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,696
The Comedy Club

2189
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:37,024
Might be more Progressive than Infowars

2190
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:42,400
Considering how terrible Motown.

2191
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:46,752
That's not

2192
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,288
And somehow

2193
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,824
It is less effective

2194
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,592
Coming from

2195
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
Yeah

2196
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,920
Pathetic man I just think

2197
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,016
Buena Vista

2198
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:58,784
Versation resist

2199
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:02,624
Is what like Media Matters covered from this

2200
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
Dissection

2201
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Yeah

2202
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
I get it

2203
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,488
Inflammatory

2204
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,792
You certainly responded to it most harshly

2205
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:13,376
Of anything I'm not happy

2206
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,400
In the back of a car

2207
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,680
The reason that I'm

2208
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,704
Chill about it

2209
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,240
Is because I get

2210
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,520
He's a

2211
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
Arabic

2212
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,616
He thinks he's like

2213
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,152
He's edgy and he's being like

2214
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,944
This is going to get me booked on

2215
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:29,760
Jim Norton Show

2216
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,296
Lamborghini goes on there and I

2217
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,880
Dyckman

2218
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,928
Is like saying the

2219
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
Saying

2220
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,512
Misty word 5 years ago

2221
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:41,536
Is like saying

2222
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,328
However many words

2223
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
10 years ago

2224
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,144
Texting all of this s***

2225
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,680
It's this idea of

2226
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,704
Just because

2227
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,984
Said the word

2228
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,288
The people don't feel like it's okay

2229
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,848
Automatically

2230
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:55,872
Legit

2231
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:59,712
I've been I'm automatically the most courageous

2232
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,736
Instead of

2233
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,088
A shity writer I've been pushing this

2234
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,136
This theory that I think that

2235
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:10,976
With all of his lawsuit Alex Jones is about to get into

2236
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,024
Late. Lenny Bruce mode

2237
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:18,400
Complaints against lawsuits

2238
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
And I think

2239
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:22,752
Gavin McInnes

2240
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:23,776
Is doing

2241
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,848
Next Generation

2242
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,408
Hacky Disciples of Lenny Bruce mode

2243
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,944
Where they think that you think

2244
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,760
He's being edgy just by saying the word

2245
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:36,576
Do you think the n-word on stage like that

2246
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:40,416
I think he's doing really really drunk

2247
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:42,976
Unreliable drugged-out bill

2248
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:47,072
If possible but the Bill Hicks that everybody f******

2249
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,376
Is not good

2250
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,144
Jordan

2251
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,192
I was trying to make a Transit

2252
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:55,264
You were doing great

2253
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
I am essentially ruining this

2254
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,872
No you're not

2255
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,920
Terrible job of the transition

2256
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,200
Cuz I realized

2257
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:07,296
Within introducing Lenny Bruce idea

2258
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,064
Read

2259
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:08,832
Go off on

2260
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:15,232
Allied Road

2261
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,000
You're not going

2262
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:16,768
Going to be able to

2263
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:19,072
Yeah

2264
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,096
It's back to his lawsuit

2265
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,680
I told you at the beginning of the show he was going to ask

2266
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:27,008
He did he was worried it's collected even further

2267
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,824
Wildly inappropriate level

2268
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,592
Yes

2269
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:35,200
My lawyers

2270
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:38,016
Georgetown

2271
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:51,328
On purpose

2272
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:56,448
Call Sabrina

2273
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,872
Holyshit

2274
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,688
Wait

2275
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:09,760
Hold on

2276
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,512
If he

2277
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:21,792
If the case

2278
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,168
Alright

2279
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,704
15K succeeds

2280
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,288
We no longer have the first the first amendment gone

2281
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:36,128
So as far as a her legal system is concerned

2282
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:40,992
The entirety of our 200 bulshit your history

2283
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,784
Will be tossed away

2284
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:49,184
The first amendment has to do with like freedom of religion freedom of assembly DeSoto

2285
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,208
Journalism

2286
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:50,976
Gone

2287
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,768
Dunno how to repeal anime

2288
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,400
Snow help

2289
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,424
Nope

2290
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,472
Nope 2/3

2291
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,496
The Congress

2292
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,288
And then it goes to the state

2293
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,848
Recorders of the states

2294
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,944
38 states with the 50 states

2295
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,224
So we have now

2296
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:17,344
All of their state legislators have to sign up

2297
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,160
No because you know why

2298
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,464
What's the only way to repeal an amendment

2299
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,768
Create a new Amendment

2300
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,096
It sounds true because once you make an amendment

2301
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,376
It's not an amendment

2302
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,912
It's a part of the constant

2303
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:37,312
That does explain why replace with another Amendment about

2304
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,592
About probation going

2305
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:39,872
Are bad guys

2306
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,200
Alex Jones

2307
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,224
Getting on his

2308
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,504
Dumbass show

2309
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,808
It's saying that his lawyers tell him

2310
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,856
But if he loses Ace

2311
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,136
Civil Trial

2312
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:53,952
It will undo the first step

2313
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,792
Love that argue

2314
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,072
I need to

2315
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,168
Crazy Eights bananas

2316
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,984
Because like legitimately goes back to what I was

2317
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:11,616
It goes back to what I was saying at the beginning of the show to that like if

2318
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,640
You believe that

2319
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Go to f***

2320
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:19,808
Can Court in this trial of the first

2321
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,368
If you lose it

2322
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,928
All you have to do is appeal it

2323
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,560
Seminole f****** win if you end up losing this trial because the Jesuits and the Pope

2324
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,584
Is against you

2325
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,120
All this horseshit

2326
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,912
You can appeal it

2327
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,192
Based on the fact that you're

2328
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,216
First Amendment rights

2329
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:41,312
Violated historical

2330
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:47,968
Hard on the First Amendment easy what do you make millions and billions of dollars and biblically whenever you're

2331
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:51,040
More money comes in

2332
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:53,088
If you have all those resources

2333
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:53,856
Seems like

2334
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
Just f******

2335
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,184
Prove it and quarter shut the fuk up

2336
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,952
As

2337
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,744
Crazy is Hanukkah is

2338
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,048
According to other previous

2339
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,888
Right

2340
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:06,656
The same

2341
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:08,192
When it comes to Alec

2342
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:08,960
Alex Jones and lost

2343
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:14,080
Bring up we did that episode about Steve

2344
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
Was that crazy

2345
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
Preacher

2346
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,176
Infowars

2347
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,992
I know what I forgot I want type of preacher I am intimately

2348
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:23,808
We familiar I wanted to bring a horse parallel

2349
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
Call between there

2350
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
Lesbian

2351
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,416
And how

2352
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:32,512
Usually take me to man they get much happier that offense

2353
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:35,328
Pilobolus

2354
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:38,656
He believes the similar things anyway

2355
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:40,960
I told you what is it what

2356
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,496
What's up

2357
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
The logs

2358
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:46,336
Lesbian until graduation no one has

2359
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,104
Ever said that

2360
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,152
People say that

2361
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:52,224
I wanted to get away from it party

2362
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Crash frat party

2363
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,344
When I was younger

2364
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,672
I lived in a area of Campus

2365
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,464
At Mizzou called East Campus

2366
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,256
I was surrounded by like

2367
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Lakefront houses

2368
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:06,816
Pretty Charming

2369
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:09,376
So I would go with like a bring a case of beer

2370
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:11,168
And then just wander into a party

2371
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,472
You crashing at speed

2372
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,496
Side Steel

2373
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,056
It was a mess

2374
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,616
Anyway

2375
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:22,176
I told you earlier detail I learned about your

2376
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
Awful book

2377
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:34,720
For now Jordan I told you that I was debating whether or not Gavin McGinnis

2378
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,000
Force

2379
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:42,656
Was the worst guest right most appearances

2380
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,448
Politically

2381
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:48,032
This is a mess

2382
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:50,080
Mostly

2383
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:54,176
On because he wants to make sure that Alex is okay with the idea of Mike Pompeo

2384
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,712
Being the Secretary of State

2385
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
Legitimately

2386
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
Based on Alex's

2387
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
Technical ideology

2388
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
Should be

2389
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:09,024
So against Pompeo

2390
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,560
Being secretary

2391
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:14,144
You should be what event what is it

2392
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,680
Full throated krita

2393
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,704
Sprite

2394
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,008
He should be like I don't know if I like the idea

2395
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:24,128
Absolutely

2396
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
You should be

2397
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,760
Mike Pompeo

2398
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:31,296
Allies in some ways

2399
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,064
Or at least

2400
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:35,136
I don't know if it's a two-way street but stupid support smite

2401
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:35,904
Pompeo

2402
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:38,464
All that's not really important

2403
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,488
It's kind of boring.

2404
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,024
Sonic says this and

2405
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,048
This is way more important

2406
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,328
And it sucks

2407
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:48,192
Soros

2408
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Uber

2409
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,136
He said giraffe

2410
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:10,720
He did that's a thing he said

2411
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:16,096
Out loud

2412
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,144
To be fair judenrat is

2413
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,472
Historical terms

2414
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,008
Like it's not

2415
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,288
It's not no

2416
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:28,640
Good

2417
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:38,624
I don't know what to think about that

2418
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,000
Okay Bob number one

2419
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,280
Politically

2420
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:51,168
You're going to botanic over McGinnis now

2421
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,192
Sing

2422
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:54,752
Previously

2423
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:57,312
I didn't like how I said

2424
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:59,616
How I could say

2425
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:01,408
And not the c word

2426
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,456
I don't appreciate

2427
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,480
Like I would

2428
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:08,320
I would prefer that it was less acceptable for me to say

2429
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,416
But

2430
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:13,952
Jurat

2431
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:15,488
Proof

2432
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:19,584
That's a f****** baseball bat to the face you know what's fun

2433
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,376
Media Matters

2434
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,776
I know

2435
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,800
Neighbors

2436
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,080
I know it's crazy

2437
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:33,664
I don't know what to do I don't know what to think about

2438
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
Like its

2439
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,712
It's me.

2440
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,784
What's the same time I do I do

2441
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,576
Give Steve pieczenik

2442
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,392
In this area

2443
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:45,184
A little bit of leeway

2444
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,744
Because he

2445
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,536
Parents fled the Holocaust

2446
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,864
And he has that in his background

2447
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,912
He's not like Alex

2448
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,192
Who's

2449
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:59,008
Entirely beholden to

2450
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,288
Justin Durant

2451
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,312
Somatic philosophy

2452
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,128
Has Steve ever considered a how

2453
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,408
His parents would for you

2454
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:06,944
I don't know

2455
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,528
Him I certainly don't want to ask living internet

2456
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,320
Anti-Semitic worldview

2457
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,368
I don't know cuz I actually

2458
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,648
I don't

2459
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:17,696
Too deep into this but the more and more I see

2460
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,232
Think about Steve pieczenik

2461
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:26,144
Understood that

2462
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:31,776
Getting him to say things I wanted to say maybe they be okay

2463
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,568
Train of thought I don't

2464
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:39,968
Want to go down later as he goes on he talks about how like he knew Soros at the Council on Foreign Relations

2465
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,736
Nation

2466
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,016
And stuff like that

2467
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,040
Doesn't like him

2468
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:43,808
Personally

2469
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:44,832
So

2470
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:50,976
Without any

2471
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:52,000
Virginia

2472
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,792
Yeah. Also if that's not okay

2473
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:55,840
It's not the

2474
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:56,864
It's not that it

2475
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,888
It's not okay

2476
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,168
Then he said

2477
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,192
Jurat

2478
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,472
Because even if he

2479
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:03,008
Didn't say that

2480
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
That pretty

2481
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:04,800
Particular

2482
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:06,080
Braised mean

2483
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,360
Exactly

2484
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,640
Exact

2485
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,432
He's a pile of

2486
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,200
F******

2487
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:14,272
Steven

2488
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,832
Actually I hope he doesn't wake up with a note

2489
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,600
Attached to him

2490
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:21,952
So I Wednesday the

2491
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:23,744
14th

2492
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,864
Alex Alex

2493
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,400
And then we go to the 15

2494
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,264
Little bit of a pep talk.

2495
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,800
It is not going great

2496
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,080
These lawsuits are

2497
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:38,848
Still there

2498
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,152

Can character Stuart Smalley

2501
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,320
He basically turns into Stuart Smalley

2502
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,648
No fear

2503
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:57,280
Other than hoping I can be a stronger man

2504
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
That's what I say

2505
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,680
I'm a winner

2506
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:07,008
Overcomer

02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,224
Bring victory

2510
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:24,416
Bring victory that makes me think of that episode of fantasy factory Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory

2511
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:27,488
We're here

2512
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:32,096
Hypnosis ceremony

Certain age

2518
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:50,784

2545
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,728
The phrase

2546
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,752

White hoping to rile up angry Muslims to attack them

2563
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,024

White

2565
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:12,608

Including Glasgow

2567
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:16,448
Coincidentally the city

The world's problems

2602
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,568
Because Cox was in

2603
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,104

2604
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:02,176

02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:07,040
Political party as well

2607

Babes

2643
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:38,688
The van

2644
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,456
Either wants

2645
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
They just sort of getting

2646
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:45,344
Sing with Alex Jones

2647
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:47,392
Is interview with David

2648
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,416
We can argue over

2649
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,440
Semantics

2650
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:51,232
Because you absolutely

2651
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:53,792
Cuz you're

2652
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,096
Your underlying philosophy

2653
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,632
He with so many of these

2654
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:58,656
Is

2655
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,680
Whiteness

2656
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,752
Always

2657
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:05,568
I feel threatened by others

2658
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:09,408
The three things that I was brought up were

2659
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,200
Marine Le Pen

2660
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:13,504
We talked about that already

2661
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,296
Not Britain first

2662
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,368
Now we have this article

2663
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,416
But Alex is referring to

2664
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,184
About

2665
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,000
How we need to

2666
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,560
Social media

2667
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:30,400
Will decide elections from now on unless conservative

2668
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:33,728
Alex brings this up about 5 times

2669
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,008
I never mentioned

2670
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,032
The guy

2671
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,824
You never says his name

2672
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,872
Probably so anyone listen

2673
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,456
I looked into it

2674
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:47,808
No guy named nail nail

2675
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,088
It's Neil but it's

2676
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,624
Iall

2677
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,392
Ferguson

2678
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
He's a British guy

2679
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:54,976
And his argument is essentially

2680
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:55,744
That

2681
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:57,536
From now on

2682
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:00,352
Social media will not allow

2683
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,376
People

2684
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:02,656
Music

2685
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:03,936
Like Trump did

2686
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,728
If you want to make that argument

2687
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:07,776
Because

2688
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,800
Has Trump used it

2689
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:10,080
Illegally

2690
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:16,736
He'll be much more careful about the influence of Cambridge analytica micro-targeting Bluegreen

2691
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:18,272
I hope so I don't know

2692
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:21,856
Conservatives are going to Bear the Brunt

2693
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,880
Of

2694
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:24,160
The changes that happen

2695
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,464
Probably true

2696
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,256
But you'd hope

2697
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,536
More important

2698
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:30,816
Things to note about

2699
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:31,840
Ferguson

2700
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,960
There's a real problem the problem with Cambridge analytica

2701
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:37,984
Is that

2702
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,752
They are

2703
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,776
F****** Brillion

2704
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,848
They're one of the few examples of the right

2705
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:43,872
Being

2706
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,176
Really killing the future

2707
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,480
Unfortunate

2708
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:53,600
Politically

2709
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,488
Do you know anything about Niall Ferguson

2710
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:00,256
I don't

2711
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:04,096
Alex Epstein his name spelled and I've been

2712
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:04,864
Furious

2713
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,632
Just hit that

2714
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:08,704
Alex a sighting in

2715
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,984
That's already

2716
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Citing him

2717
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,056
No no

2718
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:19,456
I'm out in 2015 Neil Ferguson Road in biography

2719
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,736
Henry Kissinger

2720
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,272
Call DaVita idealist

2721
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,808
It's a flawed peace

2722
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:25,088
Historical revision

2723
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:29,184
Contemporaries and historians write it off as historical trash

2724
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,976
Simply 1000

2725
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:31,744
Page Plus

2726
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,048
Peace dedicated to rewriting

2727
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,584
Kissinger's Legacy

2728
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,608
You know it's at the

2729
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,376
The thing

2730
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:39,424
Kissinger is like

2731
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,728
Every claim

2732
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:43,776
That they make about Soros

2733
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:47,616
Reasonably consider about

2734
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:50,688
Well you need to do more research but you can probably get some

2735
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:51,712
The broad Strokes

2736
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:55,552
But be that as a manager was really really

2737
02:16:55,808 --> 02:17:00,672
What was the case in reality

2738
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:01,696
Alex Jones

2739
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:02,720
Harriet's kitchen

2740
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:04,000
And this guy

2741
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:10,400
Rodent authorized biography

2742
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,168
Kissinger

2743
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,448
Exactly

2744
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,472
Then

2745
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:16,288
He was very in favor of the Iraq War

2746
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:21,664
That's not good in 2003 New York Times calling for American Empire

2747
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,456
Including the following Passage

2748
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,480
No quote

2749
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:31,904
So long as the American Empire dare not speak its own name so long as it continues its tradition of organized

2750
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:38,304
Hypocrisy young men and women will take one look at the prospects for post-war Iraq

2751
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,632
Talk about my voice don't even go there

2752
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:48,032
No Americans need to go there if the best brightest insist on staying home today

2753
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:49,824
Imperial project may end

2754
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:54,432
Unspeakably tomorrow

2755
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
But he's

2756
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,760
His entire offense

2757
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
Is about like

2758
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:00,320
The news from 2000

2759
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,904
It's all about like hey

2760
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:05,952
Let's keep this up

2761
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,560
See it through

2762
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:13,120
You understand how the British colonial life people

2763
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
I can do it

2764
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:17,216
Savannah in December 2016

2765
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,752
Neil Ferguson

2766
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:21,568
Who also is a writer for foreign policy

2767
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,384
Alex Jones's globalist publication

2768
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:26,432
Frustrated is written for them since

2769
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,968
2009

2770
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:34,880
Article titled the Russia problem

2771
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,464
The burning question of American politics

2772
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,256
How far the Russian

2773
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:44,608
It was successful in its efforts to influence the outcome of November's presidential election

2774
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,168
No longer in

2775
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,192
Serious dispute

2776
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:49,216
Russian hackers

2777
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:52,032
Especially access to emails of the Democratic National Committee

2778
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:54,080
Wikileaks acted as the conduit

2779
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:55,872
The resulting email Dobson leaks

2780
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:58,688
Probably reinforced voters negative views of Hillary Clinton

2781
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,992
A little bit later in the article

2782
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:04,576
Quote in the end it's not for the United States to solve the Russian

2783
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
That is Russia's

2784
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,952
But by re-establishing the Kissinger

2785
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,232
That the United States

2786
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,256
Should be closer to eat

2787
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:16,096
Then they are to each other

2788
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:17,888
Ministration could take an important step

2789
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:21,728
Towards cleaning up their geopolitical math bequeathed it by Barack Obama

2790
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,544
In 2016

2791
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:25,568
After the

2792
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,360
He's espousing

2793
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:29,152
A kissing Jerry and lion

2794
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
About

2795
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:30,944
Geopolitics

2796
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,736
Hey bro

2797
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,504
Hey bro

2798
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:35,296
This guy is a globalist

2799
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:40,416
You know what

2800
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:42,976
Here's how Despicable that guy is

2801
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:45,280
Kinda believe in Globe

2802
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,584
Alex sucks

2803
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:52,704
History is 3 news stories for the day

2804
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:53,984
And also

2805
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:57,568
And also

2806
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,128
French the French

2807
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,224
Government doesn't have the same free-speech laws that we do

2808
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:05,504
Defending a British

2809
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:11,648
Fascist organization

2810
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,440
And then the third guy

2811
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:18,048
Is a huge proponent of Kissinger and a fan of the Iraq War

2812
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:23,424
Current day

2813
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:24,960
I hate everything

2814
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,728
He says

2815
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:26,496
Right

2816
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,824
Anyway

2817
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,640
They don't have any idea

2818
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,664
No but it's fun

2819
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,688
They don't mean

2820
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:39,552
It's so fun for me when Alex is citing all these people and then you see their history is like

2821
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:43,136
You don't give no printables

2822
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,720
Go to court

2823
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:48,256
Frustrated

2824
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:51,328
Alex Jones gets a little bit esoteric

2825
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,352
Can enjoy that

2826
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,120
Okay good

2827
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:56,960
You freeze nurazzo

2828
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,728
I should say

2829
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:04,128
You didn't call until

2830
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:07,456
Freezer on

2831
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:08,992
I should be clear

2832
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,016
I forgot to step

2833
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,552
ShopRite

2834
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:17,952
Alex is talking about there's a startup that that's coming up it's like we can put your brain

2835
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:22,304
Cloud but it's a hundred percent fatal and everyone's clown

2836
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,120
Stupid

2837
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:25,888
This is what I

2838
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:29,216
Alex read transmetropolitan

2839
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,312
So he's getting into how like

2840
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,152
They just want

2841
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:37,920
Kill you

2842
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:48,160
Electrochemical and die once the electrochemical

2843
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,184
Resuscitated

2844
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:54,304
Is a dimensional spiritual Force

2845
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:59,936
At the six Dimension jump

2846
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:02,240
In your mind that's how people that will predict

2847
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,008
The future

2848
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:19,904
Always

2849
02:22:28,096 --> 02:22:29,120
Which FaceTime

2850
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,752
It's electromagnetic

2851
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:35,520
Frequency

2852
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,824
And then that's only third dimension

2853
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:47,296
At the very least for tonight you understand

2854
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,088
The time is

2855
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,624
The fourth

2856
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,160
I think what you don't

2857
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,256
Is the your brain is a joke

2858
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,536
Date

2859
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,072
Bow Wow's

2860
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,704
Interdimensional

2861
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,472
None of that

2862
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:07,776
That's all

2863
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:08,800
Lure

2864
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,080
I guess

2865
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:12,128
That's what I would say I don't know what the

2866
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:14,688
It's just all kinds of

2867
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:15,968
YouTube videos basically after

2868
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,248
Abid like

2869
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:19,808
The thing that I think is really fascinating

2870
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,344
Cuz all that

2871
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:25,696
It's pseudoscience

2872
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:29,536
It's the line between pseudoscience and the ravings of a mad

2873
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,352
Bananas

2874
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,632
But the thing that I think it's

2875
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:36,960
Like

2876
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:37,984
Can't

2877
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:39,008
Thought

2878
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:41,056
So he's like your brain goes through a jump

2879
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:45,152
Japanese are famous for especially the women

2880
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:51,552
Baby everybody knows a ride

2881
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:54,112
Really far away

2882
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:57,696
Would constantly have to fly 2000 miles

2883
02:23:57,952 --> 02:24:03,328
Because they got a premonition that their keeper was scaring my mind

2884
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
I don't think

2885
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,144
They can't delegate

2886
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,168
Hittite

2887
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,704
Look I don't think

2888
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,472
Most

2889
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:12,032
New cell phone most

2890
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,312
You could have just called

2891
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:15,360
Most aborigine population

2892
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,384
That exist

2893
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,408
Still to this day

2894
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:19,200
Don't need to travel 2000 MI

2895
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,504
Always

2896
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:22,528
They're very busy

2897
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,064
Salt

2898
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:26,368
Earlier

2899
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:27,648
Jordan in this episode

2900
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,440
I talked about how Alex Jones

2901
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:30,720
Inside information

2902
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:31,488
About the author

2903
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:33,024
Boston bombing

2904
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:36,352
And that was that was on the 30

2905
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:37,376
Mary comes

2906
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
To the 15th

2907
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,472
Some news

2908
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:42,496
Alex

2909
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:43,776
Validates

2910
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:45,824
That's an earlier report

2911
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,104
Take a listen

2912
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:50,176
That's not good

2913
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:51,968
Sources at the bottom side

2914
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:52,992
Involved

2915
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,296
Directions

2916
02:24:55,552 --> 02:24:58,112
Austin

2917
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,768
Unfortunately

2918
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:09,888
With that.

2919
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:36,256
On the site

2920
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,072
Wait

2921
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:41,376
But you said they were constructed

2922
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:44,704
They're constructed on the porch and then you can't move them

2923
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,520
Cuz once you move them they explode right

2924
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:49,312
And that he says that talks

2925
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:50,848
In Austin this is

2926
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:51,872
Confirming that

2927
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,432
Going to read to you from an article in Fox

2928
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,200
Austin

2929
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:56,224
How's it going

2930
02:25:56,736 --> 02:26:02,880
By Wednesday afternoon police had taken down tape and opened up oldfort Hill Drive that's where 17 years

2931
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,416
Drelen Mason lost

2932
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,208
After

2933
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:08,256
Bringing in a package

2934
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:12,096
An opening it inside his kitchen next to his mom

2935
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:17,728
Quote I heard this loud boom it woke me up the walls of the house that Jesse washing

2936
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:19,776
Nextdoor neighbor Neighbors

2937
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:22,592
Do you understand it like what he's saying is apps

2938
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:27,712
Absolutely literally contradicted by the information that has come out

2939
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:30,016
You can't move them

2940
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:31,296
Eddie thought this was

2941
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:33,856
This confirmed it the case is

2942
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:36,160
Weird

2943
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:38,464
It was the most movable

2944
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:40,256
Such nonsense

2945
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,792
I just I don't understand

2946
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,840
Understand he's grasping at

2947
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:46,656
We have one more click left

2948
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,936
Play an Isaac

2949
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,752
His real son

2950
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,800
It starts pain

2951
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:55,104
And then we get a sense

2952
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:55,872
I don't like

2953
02:26:56,128 --> 02:26:58,176
I wish you would just stop it

2954
02:26:58,432 --> 02:27:00,736
It starts

2955
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:02,272
You know that that whole like

2956
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:03,296
Rite-Way

2957
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:05,344
Complaint whenever there's a school shooting

2958
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:08,928
That like you would mediately turn it political

2959
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:15,328
I'm going to spoil this a little bit

2960
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,120
Want you to spoil is a little bit

2961
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:20,192
So earlier today in Florida there was a bridge

2962
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:23,264
Yes I recall people passed away

2963
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,336
How fast Alex

2964
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:31,968
Political do you get that that's not even wait for it

2965
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,016
Situation

2966
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:39,648
McDonald's inside

2967
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:51,424
Of the information War if Alex Jones

2968
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:56,544
950 John

2969
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:02,176
Pedestrian bridge collapse

2970
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:08,832
Our prayers go out to everybody and that's too bad

2971
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:13,696
Are in the Washington

2972
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:19,328
Cars

2973
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,120
BMV

2974
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,872
Avenues in hours

2975
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:36,736
Well

2976
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:40,064
Gone forever

2977
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,368
Bridge

2978
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:47,744
Highway

2979
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,048
Killed

2980
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:51,584
The people

2981
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,120
In Florida

2982
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,168
According to that broken logic

2983
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:56,704
Of course we didn't tell him

2984
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:57,728
Quercetin

2985
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:02,848
Into a anti-gun regulation message

2986
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:04,384
In like 12 seconds

2987
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:05,920
And also

2988
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:07,200
Logic doesn't

2989
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:11,552
Because you know what would help with these Bridges

2990
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:14,112
Is type

2991
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:18,208
I think it probably be like people everything needs to be up to code to needs

2992
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:18,976
Bee inspection

2993
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:20,256
Of bridges

2994
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:24,096
Who are actually building it need to be licensed

2995
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,632
Those are things

2996
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:27,168
So actually

2997
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,960
By his own words

2998
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:32,288
Skis kind of advocate

2999
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,848
Elations Alex you're stupid

3000
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,152
F******

3001
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:40,736
Unbelievable

3002
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,272
Even come

3003
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,552
Close to understanding

3004
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:44,832
Wyatt is

3005
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:46,880
Bridgewood color

3006
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:53,280
That's crazy

3007
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:56,864
What's think about wire bridge collapse

3008
02:29:57,376 --> 02:29:58,144
Okay

3009
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,424
Let's start from the beginning

3010
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:01,216
Alright you're building a bridge

3011
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:07,360
Really afford to replace

3012
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,128
Haystack Bridge

3013
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,408
To the level that you

3014
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:10,944
You need to cut some corn

3015
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:11,712
Cutting

3016
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:15,040
How do you cut costs Dan

3017
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,320
Low beds

3018
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:21,696
If your government was funded better

3019
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,768
You'll be able to afford

3020
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,048
To do the

3021
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:29,120
F****** right in the same way

3022
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:37,824
The reasons they were in the situation that we are right now with infrastructure

3023
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:45,248
Is because I went the New Deal happened there was a ton of money for infrastructure work and Roads

3024
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:48,576
Pretty strong Bridges and now it's been

3025
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:50,368
70 years

3026
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:58,304
You know it's bridge collapse in Miami is going to be indicative of

3027
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:01,632
More Bridge collapses that are going to happen

3028
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:03,168
Debbie still use meat

3029
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:06,496
Harbinger of things to come

3030
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:09,824
Personally shutting down the New York to New Jersey

3031
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:10,592
Trainline

3032
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:14,176
Like he's doing that just because they

3033
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,808
Is what like

3034
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:21,088
15% of our

3035
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:22,368
Economy that is

3036
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,904
Elves

3037
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:25,696
Hostage by him.

3038
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:26,720
Doing this bridge

3039
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:28,512
There's so much

3040
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,048
Of this that is

3041
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:32,864
Exactly what the New Deal

3042
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,632
Was in response

3043
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,216
Capable of dealing with some

3044
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:37,984
Something

3045
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,008
Preemptive

3046
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,288
Cast

3047
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:42,848
Stupid, disaster and then America's like

3048
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:43,872
Oh

3049
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:44,640
I got it

3050
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:48,480
4 what 40 years before the Great

3051
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:49,760
Depression it was a

3052
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:50,528
Constant

3053
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:53,600
NeverEnding let's cut taxes let's make

3054
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,624
Income inequality

3055
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,952
Insane as possible

3056
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:59,488
And then once it is

3057
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:00,256
Orderly

3058
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,048
We destroyed

3059
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:04,864
America's like oh yeah socialism is great

3060
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:08,960
And then when everything's fine everybody's like oh yeah

3061
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:10,240
Free market is great

3062
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:13,312
And then that f****** destroy the economy and everybody's like

3063
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:15,872
Oh yeah maybe Bernie Sanders

3064
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:17,408
I think this is

3065
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,712
I think

3066
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:20,480
Hannibal

3067
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:23,040
Bulshit system that we live in

3068
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:24,576
And the fact that

3069
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:26,112
Let me get back to this

3070
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:32,256
The guy is the best that the Democrats can f****** do

3071
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:39,680
Hannibal maybe a liberal

3072
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,216
Disc

3073
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:42,240
She's the best I can do

3074
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,056
Maybe if somebody would actually

3075
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:47,616
Both Road

3076
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,152
For reality

3077
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:51,456
Maybe people

3078
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,784
I'm just I'm just saying that that

3079
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:56,320
But the concept

3080
02:32:56,576 --> 02:32:58,112
Democratic party has

3081
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:00,672
We need to be at

3082
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:02,464
Parade of our ideas

3083
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:10,656
If the idea was

3084
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,680
F*** yeah

3085
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:16,800
Let's f****** live up to what it is we believe instead of this constant

3086
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:20,896
Mitigation of our Concepts in our ideas

3087
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:22,688
We would f****** win

3088
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:25,504
Maybe the Overton window would be

3089
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,040
Closer towards the f******

3090
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
Center

3091
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:29,856
Instead of closer towards the edge

3092
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:31,904
You can possibly go

3093
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,440
Lake Murray Loop

3094
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,768
Winning election here

3095
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,560
Myalgia

3096
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:40,352
The problem that you have is

3097
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:43,424
Did your rhetoric is that there is no

3098
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,264
Exactly

3099
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,032
It's not a

3100
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:49,312
Two-dimensional specs

3101
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:52,640
There is there is the right

3102
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:53,920
And there is

3103
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:54,688
Reality

3104
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:58,784
And if you are anywhere near the right

3105
02:33:59,296 --> 02:34:01,344
You are as far away from reality as you can

3106
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:03,392
I think I think

3107
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,928
At the end of this one

3108
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:07,232
Tragedy that

3109
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:08,512
We're about to befall in all

3110
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:14,144
There will be no

3111
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:17,728
But if there is there will be another

3112
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:19,264
FDR ish

3113
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,032
Move

3114
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,824
It would help in order to

3115
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:23,872
Everything from the design

3116
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:24,640
After we find our

3117
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:30,784
What we should do is kill everybody over 15 if you were able to pull that off

3118
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,808
The next thing

3119
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:33,856
I would hope that we do

3120
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:36,928
Is do it better

3121
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,744
Cuz at the end of the new deal

3122
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,768
I think we blew it

3123
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,048
I think we blew it

3124
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:46,400
Adverbs of transition

3125
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,168
Immensely

3126
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:49,472
Cause of this very same

3127
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:56,128
Concept 15 coming quality

3128
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:02,528
Bottom line is Alex Jones being sued by a bunch of people who are real

3129
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,344
So I can draw on this anymore I got a bit

3130
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:14,304
If you were looking for it I've made a critical mistake in that I had too much Conte

3131
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:23,008
But if you like our show you where I know

3132
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:25,312
At knowledge underscore fighting

3133
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:29,152

Incredible and because

It is

3145
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,008
Really important
