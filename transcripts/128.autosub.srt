00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,568
Hi

The names of the people I need to give a shout out to cuz I forgot to do that pre-show

10
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,368
What kind of signal could I give you the high sign

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,376
Coming back to stretch out a little bit is giving

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
I really appreciate it

13
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
Don't get mad and tell your brother

Oh yeah

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
What is it like

17
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you think

18
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Canada

19
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Miles Davis

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
It's called

21
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Kilometers Davis

22
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
Debauchery

23
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
And I love it

24
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,616
Self-conscious

25
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Off the top

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Cuz I pick the name of Shannon

27
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
But the spelling makes it

28
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,112
It's shanin but either way

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
Whatever however you pronounce it I apologize but I don't know for sure but we do appreciate you

30
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Thank you so much

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
Congratulations

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
From now on and this isn't something that I think

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Think is a rule that we should

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
Should have but instead of signing your name or your name down

35
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
Send an audio clip

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
Let's completely phonetic

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Who knows you can do so by going to dollartree.com

38
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Sports

39
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Has donated

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Created a situation where

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Now

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Do a full-length documentary commentary track of

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Alex Jones

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
Terrible documentary endgame

45
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
I would we will be doing

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Releasing

47
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Shortly

48
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
You were working this weekend at a club so we were not able to get together and I'll make it happen this weekend but next weekend

49
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Will be recording it

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
I believe releasing it over the course

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,208
Of the next week so we look at a we look at a calendar that'll be the night

52
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Keep that looks like the 19th will be wine

53
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
The documentary starts dropping

54
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Oh okay

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,936
So that means that will be will be spending all of daylight

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,568
One day most likely how long how long is

57
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,688
These days not that long ago

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
So

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Fiesta

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Sometimes I feel so stupid because I'm like

61
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Wait

62
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Are the days getting shorter or longer right

63
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
Summer solstice when I get shorter or longer

64
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
Equinox what is the summer solstice

65
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
I don't know

66
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
Have to go in galivants around with

67
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
And celebrate

68
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
I don't know

69
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
Celebrate around summer solstice

70
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Does the passage of time

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
Transitioning

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
Great transitions even better than you know

73
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
So what time

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Get that people donate on the time traveler level

75
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
Time travel

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Behind Project Camelot time travel

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
My favorite this one's very weird

78
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,895
We got it we got a request for time travel episode just the other day

79
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
We had one from Fox

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
October that we forgot to do

81
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
This one

82
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:48,255
Put on it about it cuz I went back and I told you I needed to do a little bit more research and

83
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Custom stuff

84
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
Just forgot because Alex got drunk

85
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
Episode

86
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,471
The present is such a hot mess that's like what are we going to do

87
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
That's such a perfect

88
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Issue with our shows like

89
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,223
We were going to do something but then Alex got drunk so there we go

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,367
I was going to do this than Alex.

91
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
That's always

92
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
I cannot believe

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
What song was so big man

94
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Terrible

95
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,959
This time travel episode

96
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Jessie

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
We really appreciate that

98
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
Sporting the show and what you requested

99
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
To their birthday

100
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Which is March 3rd

101
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Of any year

102
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
Birthday about that

103
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
A couple March 3rd

104
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
And I found

105
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Almost nothing to

106
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Be excited about right

107
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Can I listen to March 2015

108
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
And I

109
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Highest high weird

110
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
Very high-level weirdness on Alex's party

111
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Phantom excited to break down some of it

112
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
Here is a clip

113
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Text drop

114
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
For you to enjoy from this

115
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
I don't know if I can answer that question

116
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Also slightly take issue with the idea that science fiction

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
I think every part of that sentence is wrong

118
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
Mary Wild

119
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
I would describe it as

120
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Tragically Wild

121
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Okay fine

122
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Nazi

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
Know it cuz he know

124
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
It's just a dream

125
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
The man we know that

126
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
That's true

127
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Possibly

128
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Just give you a little break down on what's

129
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
What's going to happen on this year March 3rd 2015 was the day that Benjamin Netanyahu

130
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Did that

131
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Angry about that actually hits the nail

132
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Right on the head

133
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,767
In the middle of the power play

134
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
Election

135
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
The flexing of power coming over here in consolidation

136
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Obama was not into that

137
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Rich

138
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Weird feelings about

139
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,063
Yeah we all have however I think Alex

140
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
She's probably on the wrong side

141
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
You know what I don't know what side he's on

142
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
That's right

143
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
That's right

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
He loves right wing

145
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,495
We're going to get into something that's really interesting that is like different versions of anti-semitism

146
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
They're going to come up because

147
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,127
There is like ethnic anti-Semitism in political anti-semitism

148
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
Kind of not always related

149
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
There's the version of like

150
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
I hate

151
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
The Jewish

152
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
People

153
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
And that comes out through like blood libel

154
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
11

155
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
And then you have political anti

156
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Semitism which comes

157
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
In the form of life

158
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Being opposed to Zionism

159
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
Weird

160
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Division

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Between those two

162
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
And I'm not sure I can fully explain all of it to you but

163
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,639
Alex is kind of guilty

164
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,759
If there is a way to be Alex will find it

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Alex is

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
At 8

167
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,951
Some ways his most admirable dinosaurs

168
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Jurassic Park

169
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Life

170
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
Episode twice

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
And a half now probably cutting the clips and everything

172
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
Understand where Alex is coming from

173
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
I don't understand what you saying

174
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
Because he's been put into a really uncomfortable position

175
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,247
Because he doesn't like like you said he's supports right-wing type stuff

176
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
To be really involved in Israel they packed Library very strong

177
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
You just he doesn't know where to land on it

178
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
A bunch of ambivalence

179
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Jewish people

180
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
You can't love is

181
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
If you hate

182
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Muslims

183
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
You kind of have to like

184
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
Israel if you love the right wing

185
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
For some reason

186
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
They hate Muslim people and

187
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
Palestinians like I don't know what anybody is doing

188
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,503
The Sovereign to you can't really be thrilled with the prime minister of a foreign country

189
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Coming in and speaking to Congress

190
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Against the wishes of the president

191
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,255
He's a man without a country and you see it sort of coming up already here in the

192
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Broadcast

193
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
In the third day of March 2015 Benjamin Netanyahu

194
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,263
He'll just basically completed

195
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Some of the

196
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Spoiler alert

197
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Breakdown the

198
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
At all really

199
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Israel will not be

200
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,159
Like we won't be the victims of genocide all aggression

201
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Ever again

202
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Do me quotes

203
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Guess you with that

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,167
But the sentiment I agree with

205
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
The problem with that quote is

206
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Really it kind of is a

207
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
It's almost in netanyahu's words

208
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
The opposite

209
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Of what he's intending it to mean which is

210
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
We won't be the victims of a genocide

211
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
And the only way to ensure that

212
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Is to genocide everybody else

213
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
Right right there is there's a feeling of

214
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
You're not you're not saying everything

215
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
I'm here

216
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Pharrell

217
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
So don't look forward

218
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,543
Because regardless

219
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
In the face of genocide aggression are over

220
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Refused

221
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Chariot

222
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Pelosi on the floor

223
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
We've got video of all of this ring to be healing up

224
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
Problems with some

225
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Diverse country

226
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,079
Alicia

227
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,967
Not biased

228
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
To secure

229
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,343
Economic foothold and to secure the US

230
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Israel

231
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
So we're already seeing

232
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
There's a conspiracy in his mind

233
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Israel is using after they back in order to reinforce

234
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Our support of them

235
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
No using the

236
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
The the word

237
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
That doesn't make any goddamn

238
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
He doesn't have anywhere to go you can't be against this me can't before it

239
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
He's got to play The Middle

240
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,047
Pandora play the middle he's got to be really weird about it how complicated is B is real situation

241
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
Even Alex doesn't have an opinion

242
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Yeah that's

243
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
That's how complicated it is pretty complicated

244
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Many thoughts and opinions and I have

245
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
0 solution

246
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Is all of them are like

247
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
I mean

248
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
Genocide I think that's the start

249
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
That's a damn good solution

250
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
Let's solution

251
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Orlistat

252
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,959
Transitional bowl today

253
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Be a lot easier

254
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
You know this is going to play out it's going to keep going

255
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
Here in this next clip is where Alex

256
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
Certificates on a reasonable

257
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Playground

258
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Interpret

259
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
The political

260
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Loses it real quick

261
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Obama said he wasn't going to watch it

262
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,119
Pelosi freaks out and

263
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
Netanyahu's facing re-election

264
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
And by the Democrats

265
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Socialist

266
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Anti-israel to the Core

267
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
Sure

268
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Different

269
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Israel

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,631
The whole thing's very very hard to figure out some of the barrel

271
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
At the bottom of the whole situation

272
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
If you go to a leftist event

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Karl Marx

274
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Real quick

275
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Karl Marx

276
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,879
Is because he at the beginning of this episode of Play-Doh Mark Dice report

277
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
Where he went out on the street and ask people if they see

278
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Supportive

279
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,607
He was supported Obama

280
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Christening Karl Marx is his successor as president

281
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Beavers like

282
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
Most of the people

283
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
Pretty bad so amazing Heather

284
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
Basic competency requires to

285
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
To do a man-on-the-street interview

286
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
It's still Beyond

287
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Time let's not forget

288
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,303
I believe that Frederick Douglass was still alive

289
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
So I mean if you want to play that game

290
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
Karl Marx

291
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
Whatever I mean

292
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
They're promoting

293
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
And handing out and shelling

294
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Who's doing that

295
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
The right

296
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Their literal Nazis

297
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
You should read some of these stories that are coming out about like

298
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
What's going on on College

299
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
Increase 300-volt r300 percent

300
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
And the last

301
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
6 months

302
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Jessica

303
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Have you heard that

304
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,527
The story up from the one college where they had

305
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
They had a right-wing rally

306
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
All set to go

307
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Free speech

308
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Yeah and then

309
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Because they were

310
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Concerned there was also at the same time

311
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
A movement

312
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Raaa

313
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
An event

314
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
To support

315
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Right

316
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
So they were like okay

317
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
Well we got to let these knots

318
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Please talk

319
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
So we're going to cancel the support for black

320
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
People movement

321
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
More America

322
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
Nothing is more American than

323
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
Well we got to let the Nazis talk what I mean that's just point

324
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
Baked into that idea of free speech being too

325
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Protect unappealing

326
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
Maybe fetishize that a little bit

327
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
Then the very same group

328
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,567
We'll run around claiming that brown bags are racist

329
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,431
And having a fiesta party

330
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Tabo

331
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
Enchiladas

332
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
The Mexican

333
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Obsession

334
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
24/7 on

335
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
So

336
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
No

337
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
How he got

338
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Any of those thoughts

339
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
UK

340
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,319
To talk about Jews a lot in this episode

341
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Master like talk about all of his other narratives and then sort of goodbye them but not

342
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
How much it's

343
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
This is one of the most

344
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Like

345
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
Ambivalent

346
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Alex I've ever heard

347
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
To go to Florida in any direction

348
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,615
Going to piss off somebody but at the same time we talk about this all the time the idea of like

349
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
Didn't with the sombrero parties that he's talking about

350
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,551
Using someone else's culture as a costume

351
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,415
I would like to also point out this is a really fun thing

352
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Cemetery in Louisa row

353
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
British.

354
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Material needed a series called weird weekend

355
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Where he would go and hang out with

356
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Fringe

357
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
People for a weekend

358
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
You wouldn't like the Westboro

359
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
Church for weekend is pretty horrifying

360
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Reminder you about whites

361
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Supremacist

362
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Metzger's

363
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Something Metzger

364
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,695
It's not but he's a big leader in the white supremacist

365
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Movement

366
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,559
And what have you and go give speeches at

367
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Neo-Nazi rallies

368
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,959
Happening is it turns out that

369
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
He likes to go to Mexico

370
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
And get really

371
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Can waste it

372
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Bluey goes along with this

373
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
F****** white supremacist

374
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Nazi

375
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
To Mexico

376
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
Because he's weird

377
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
Coked-out lawyer guy who represents him

378
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Banging around with a Mexico

379
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Prostitute

380
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
So they go down to Mexico

381
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
And of course it's just

382
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
This Metzger going around with a sombrero drinking tequila

383
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,727
Mexico have ever seen in my life

384
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
1st and White 2

385
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Supremacist

386
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
And somehow I don't

387
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
Understand that bore after you told me that

388
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,175
I recommend a documentary so highly

389
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Just a

390
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Aesthetic look

391
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Hateful man

392
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,439
Those are all on YouTube

393
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Yeah that's true

394
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,351
Throws Works. Highlights

395
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,191
Alright has great style where he's like really unassuming

396
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
Kind of people to open up in ways that they probably should

397
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Very compelling

398
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
Hangs out with

399
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
A couple skinheads

400
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
These Jewish

401
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,439
Really rather not answer

402
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Get the f*** out of my garage

403
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
If I camera wasn't here I would beat your ass

404
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Suicide really

405
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
I prefer not to

406
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
No

407
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,223
Alex talks about

408
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Define whistle

409
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Jewish based conspiracies

410
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
But somehow it's not okay for other one

411
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,440
That's very weird

412
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,792
He has to be loves it whenever anybody pisses off

413
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
He doesn't know what it is

414
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Is he supposed to say

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Yep

416
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Totally

417
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,336
That's going to come into play a little bit later to that specific feeling that he has about

418
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Democrat

419
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:44,064
It's like it's like an old west movie where some a****** is like

420
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Firing a gun at his feet like

421
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
The here

422
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
Only way I can describe this is

423
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Starting

424
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Talk about something then

425
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Super off tracking

426
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
But you have no idea where he's going

427
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
And it's acceptable

428
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
In leftist ideology

429
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,224
Jewish conspiracy of colonial

430
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
No there's not

431
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
That's not acceptable

432
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
That's the spirit

433
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Do you understand what he's getting out there

434
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
No

435
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,864
I don't know hundred percent either but I believe the Woody saying is there is

436
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
Flipaclip play Let's see if he gives us more context

437
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Exclusion

438
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Not good

439
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
And then

440
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
A Jewish conspiracy

441
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,504
Basically

442
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,096
Shawarma guys

443
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
An insert with that something that juice

444
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
I want juice work to be

445
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,872
Position

446
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Show me nobody

447
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
Achievers education

448
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,464
All I know is evil inherently

449
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
I'm constantly fighting with each other like every other group

450
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
And runs the gamut from

451
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
That's not the whole thing

452
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Or or some of the others

453
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,896
I'm just sick of the stereotype

454
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
And then the globalist above that the very same problems that you socialism

455
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
As their control system

456
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
Who are definitely not you

457
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,184
Again

458
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
Scapegoat

459
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Problems

460
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
I do I am

461
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Very uncomfortable

462
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
I'm deeply troubled by what he saying

463
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
It's still weird for him to be like

464
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,432
Weather left says

465
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Conspiracies

466
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,064
And the right isn't allowed to

467
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Industry

468
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
Because my profile position

469
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,168
And I'm against they are over

470
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
All Jews are the same thing

471
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
But I'm against stereotype

472
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
It's almost like he's saying

473
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
I mean

474
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
What are you saying is like

475
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
The left has their conspiracies right as theirs

476
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,832
Most of them are true

477
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:03,232
Behind my sexual things true

478
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,912
What books does Harry gets off the hookah is like different

479
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,752
Different I'm not being able to make when I use all the

480
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Describe the globalist

481
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:21,664
And I can't really prove it exists most of the globalist that I do talk about

482
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
Wind up being Jewish like the Rothschilds

483
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
Ed Oliver

484
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,624
Completely lie about the other history we're going to get into a little busier

485
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,696
Everybody knows nothing about Jewish history

486
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Especially like Alex's

487
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Dangerous edible leaves

488
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
But he has about the Rothschilds that like

489
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
I mean

490
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
We could do

491
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
2 hours on it cuz it's a disaster

492
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
What we just listen to is a little bit

493
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Desi Alex

494
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Tread lightly you're heading towards something

495
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,112
About complaint the people

496
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,928
Tired of being attacked for being anti-Semitic

497
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,768
And then he launches into something directly antisymmetric

498
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,608
Throughout my life

499
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Who will blame

500
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
For all of their problems

501
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,384
Don't want to

502
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
That's what it comes down to

503
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,808
And this comes from somebody who's Ben Savage

504
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,696
Israel

505
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
George Soros is a Jew

506
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
The guy

507
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
Ron's organization

508
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
196 million

509
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
With the US government

510
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
I can find

511
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Didn't know eviden

512
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,568
Notoriously developed

513
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Marine Corps

514
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
I'm largely responsible for the dissemination of

515
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

516
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,624
Personally responsible for Distributing hundreds of thousands of copies

517
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Anti-semitic fraud

518
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
The Ford Foundation analysis

519
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Came out in the church

520
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
Committee that it was that guy

521
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Government-run and

522
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
Got these documents Anthony Sutton

523
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
Written a number of books about likes

524
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Skull and bones

525
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
And what have you

526
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
I tried to find any connection to

527
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
To him and

528
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
Church committee

529
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
The Ford Foundation

530
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
And that

531
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
I came up with no

532
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,088
We just made that one up whole committee was about invest

533
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Navigating the CIA and the FBI

534
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
Intelligence operation

535
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
And of course whether or not to buy

536
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Absolutely

537
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
I don't I don't know

538
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
I would withhold judgment on this one

539
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,312
But my gut tells me he's just pulling at straws

540
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Because

541
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
I like

542
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Frankly

543
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
I kind of kind of at the end of this episode

544
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,112
All I need to know how I feel about Alex

545
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
And his stance is just

546
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
Play the little clip of himself

547
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Jew

548
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
And you're like Soros

549
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,864
Is it

550
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,168
It's really fascinating to me

551
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
To hear him go from like

552
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
I'm so f****** sick

553
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
I'm tired of everybody saying that I made

554
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
Everybody just lies about me

555
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,432
All these leftist Jewish organizations lie about being called me racist

556
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:13,088
George Soros is a completely lying about George Soros

557
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Directed way

558
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
And again

559
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,768
I don't want to be defending

560
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
But I

561
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
When there are these sort of accusation

562
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Spurious

563
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Fraudulent accusations

564
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
Being levelled against him

565
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Specifically

566
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Because he's doing

567
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Resume

568
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
George soros's just want our

569
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Bizarre

570
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Financial

571
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
December 10th

572
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Right let's get it and I Alex

573
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
You cannot just sit there and point

574
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Complex

575
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,632
Rothschild family

576
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
I did

577
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
So

578
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Well

579
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
This is

580
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
This is deeply

581
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Deeply troubling

582
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
Not true killed The Rock

583
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Child tour

584
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Where's Matt

585
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
Then that where he's going for here

586
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
I guess I don't know

587
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
The Rothschilds

588
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Funded Hitler

589
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,472
If you look into the actual history of it in March 1938 within days of

590
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Angeles

591
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,616
Personnel

592
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Alice's

593
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
From Alphonse residence

594
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,224
Plunderers took 3444 items

595
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
And from Louise mansion

596
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Louis

597
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Bluey

598
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,880
Additional 919

599
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
+ 190

600
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
Everything was meticulously inventory with the most

601
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,328
Important Works earmarked for Hitler's plan fewer Museum in Austria

602
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
The town of his birth

603
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
Lesser pieces were directed to the Viennese Museum

604
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,960
And others mainly porcelains were fenced

605
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
State-owned auction

606
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Open house at Dorothy

607
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Dorothy

608
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,432
Has the war preceded The Collection was transferred from several locations outside Vienna and I-90

609
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
1844

610
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Open hidden in the

611
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,064
Altos a salt mines near Salzburg safe for my lights on

612
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
The following year the America

613
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
42nd division

614
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,952
Hey baba by they were able to

615
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Mix it around

616
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
The restaurant business Empire with pants down

617
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Generate

618
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Until March 13th

619
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
1938

620
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Came in

621
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
Two salads banking

622
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
A fraction of its real worth

623
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Well are the Rothschilds

624
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Was in prison for a year and only released after substantial Ranch

625
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
It was paid by his fans

626
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
After Louis was released

627
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,880
In March 1939 the Nazis place

628
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Form of SMS

629
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
Under compulsory Administration

630
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
Nazi officers

631
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Senior staff

632
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,352
Free museums also empty the Rothschild family estate of all their value

633
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
So basically what ended up having

634
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,240
Is that the family had almost all of their wealth

635
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Stolen by the

636
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
A lot of them were already out of

637
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
The country by vendor least the one

638
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Areas

639
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Became occupied by knobs

640
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
Directions work

641
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
And they were f****** multi-millionaires back then

642
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
So one of the one of the great myths about the Rothschild has if they have like somebody took money week

643
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Because they had millions of dollars

644
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,936
100 years ago

645
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
So they're not nearly like

646
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Sure family probably still has

647
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
In the billions of dollars

648
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
Family is spread through

649
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
All sorts of marriages and

650
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
Kids and generations

651
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,320
The power that the family wields is

652
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Almost

653
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Yeah

654
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
Now in researching this claim

655
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
This is before you go any further

656
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
This is such

657
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
An awful thing for Alex

658
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
To do because

659
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Every example

660
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
He's giving

661
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Bar

662
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Jews

663
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,776
Participating in the Jewish

664
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
Exactly my point

665
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,896
It's just like if it is

666
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
So close to him saying like

667
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Well they had a common

668
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
Cause of their own Jen

669
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
The most

670
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
Powerful Jews were the ones who are really perpetrating

671
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,000
The genocide that way I don't have to because a white person

672
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
Eastlake their own suicide black families do

673
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,240
Don't stick together so that's why they're poor

674
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
Layman disenfranchised populations

675
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
4 things

676
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,384
Society has foisted upon them

677
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,736
Especially

678
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,576
Male dominated Society has foisted upon them

679
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
For the crime of being other

680
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Now

681
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
While I was researching this claim about the roster

682
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Something very in

683
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
That is a 1995 article from the New York

684
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Let me redo the

685
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Dutcher Bank

686
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
Admits it helped Hitler

687
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Confronting a dark

688
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:22,336
Got your bank the expiration of Jewish businesses and helped Hitler consolidate

689
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Control over Germany's Neighbors

690
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,712
Between 1933 and 1945 according to a history of the bank

691
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
To be published in March

692
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
So

693
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
The Dutch bank

694
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Came out and said

695
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,744
So this guy I mean like go back to

696
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Siemens

697
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
Made

698
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,216
One of the newest members of the board Oscar

699
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
Wasserman was forced to resign in 1933

700
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,360
Start to be long string of such recognized

701
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
But George

702
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Thompson

703
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,040
Successor to Mr Wasserman a prosthetic letter to the chairman of the bank's supervisory board

704
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
I fear we are embarking on it

705
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Explicit well plan

706
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Passports the annihilation of all Jews

707
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Germany

708
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
Mr. Sampson lambasted the

709
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
The passivity and

710
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Complete lack of solidarity

711
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Other countries Elite

712
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Most of them had not yet

713
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
Become members of the Nazi party

714
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
Refused the bank personnel

715
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
The party before 1933

716
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Many opportunist

717
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Opportunist

718
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Did so after Hitler assume power

719
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:30,176
At the end of the war in 1945 44 the bank's 84 Branch officers were partying

720
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
All them a joint after night

721
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
33

722
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
In the end mr. James wrote

723
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,856
The guy was right in the history of this stuff

724
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Bankers unlock generals were largely

725
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
Powerless to decisively influence of course

726
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,280
History but through their passivity they also contributed to the whores

727
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Now why is it important

728
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
I would like to

729
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Nice of them

730
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Just save it

731
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Bankers

732
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
Have no influence

733
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,360
Isn't that interesting the bank history

734
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Change

735
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
You know just

736
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,040
Having all of the money that they make

737
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
See with the Rothschilds situation

738
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
If you didn't

739
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
Play ball they were just going to take out the Nazis were just going to take over your bank

740
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Like it's not

741
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
I'm not saying anyone off the hook

742
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
But in terms of being able to

743
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
What was going on

744
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
I don't think the bank

745
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Cuz really had that much

746
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,776
Much control their past

747
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
Very clearly said in there

748
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
And they should be deeply ashamed that they didn't do anything

749
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
But

750
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
I find it hard to believe

751
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
That

752
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
The

753
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Thanks

754
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
At that time

755
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,904
Would not have been able to wield

756
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Enough financial power

757
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Curb

758
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
A lot of

759
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
Maybe I don't know I don't know but I don't know that either of us knows entirely but

760
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Banks divesting themselves

761
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
From oil

762
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah

763
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Climate change is

764
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Immediately

765
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Yeah but that that

766
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,408
Totally different than the idea of climate change being a

767
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
An army

768
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
That has

769
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
Authoritarian

770
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
On power in the

771
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
No I armies armies

772
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Actively complicit climate change

773
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
And a gas company

774
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Are not they don't have foot

775
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Soldiers that will

776
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Dudley take over your back

777
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,984
In the same way that the Nazis did

778
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,312
I understand what you're saying and I agree with the points

779
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
It's not like they kept all their money in

780
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
I mean maybe they just had a big ass bolt and full of gold

781
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
Yeah but

782
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,808
He's going to go to branches

783
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
Each individual branch and be like hey

784
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,696
We're going to take 50 bucks from all of these like I don't know what the

785
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Possibly

786
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Possibly they would

787
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah that's true

788
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Fascist

789
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,240
Takeover State and everything

790
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
I'm not again I want to be totally clear that I'm not letting

791
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Any

792
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Off the hook

793
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
I think every

794
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Bank executives

795
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
It's probably guilty of

796
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
295 article is admitting

797
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Helped Hitler in the Holocaust

798
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,840
Pulled roughly 300 million in debt

799
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
To Dutch a back

800
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Leslie that

801
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Without comment

802
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Well anyway

803
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Complaints about how

804
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Coronavirus real

805
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
I know Israel Traverse different political parties different ideas

806
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
I have a love-hate relationship

807
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
She better get a hundred percent behind

808
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
That's wrong

809
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
Israel wasawasa Portmore

810
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,752
The end-all-be-all only thing on the planet

811
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,160
Israel

812
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
I don't know I think it was just

813
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
Film the other country could think of

814
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,376
I don't think that's how people think

815
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
No

816
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
Indoctrinated

817
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,360
Rapidly nationalistic things

818
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
Nationalist

819
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Like I don't have anything against

820
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
America as a

821
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
I like America

822
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
I think we could do better about a lot of stuff

823
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Destroy America

824
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
But at the same time

825
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
I don't think we're the most

826
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Important thing in the world

827
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,096
I think the world is the most important thing in the world

828
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,680
And I think a lot of people in other countries

829
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
Voorhees part of bread

830
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
They were maybe a Welsh

831
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,688
Oh well smash rejuvenation

832
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
I am

833
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Extreme Dodge

834
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
Probably Alex

835
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
Technically Alex

836
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
He's Welsh

837
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,512
That's true but look I don't know nationalism

838
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,864
Alex goes off on some stuff later but

839
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
You can't be a nationalist if

840
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
If your words don't

841
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Is Matt

842
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Is not how that works

843
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
Welsh

844
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Okay sorry

845
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
Degrassi pill

846
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,064
Great Scrabble words you people out there

847
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
WM

848
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Should be a word but it is

849
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
Alex Jones

850
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:11,168
I meant he complains a little bit about his own personal plight

851
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
He doesn't like

852
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,776
More black people beat up white people that I've ever seen

853
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,640
Israel more than Israel

854
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Not great

855
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
All these Arab countries won't let the Palestinians give them Aid

856
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:35,232
Palestinian conflict

857
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
What country singer used as a political football

858
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
To manipulate everyone

859
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
Is held to a higher standard

860
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
No

861
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
It's a paradox because

862
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Never experience

863
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
Triology

864
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Hatred

865
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,183
I have from anti-israel

866
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
They will make stuff up

867
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Everyone is a Jew

868
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,935
Care of your Richardson green

869
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Johnson

870
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
Sanchez

871
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Cian

872
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,639
Really thinking about Mexican everyone is a Jupiter all-powerful

873
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
I never borrowed a dime

874
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,879
Multiplication tens of thousands of dollars from your dad

875
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
It's a very frustrating all the Nazi websites

876
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
Photoshopped

877
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
Videos

878
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
Israeli agent

879
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,223
It's amazing Untold

880
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Roman stuff

881
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
It's alright

882
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,183
Tired of sitting here watching anti-israel

883
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Degenerates by the minute

884
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
Situation I want prosperity

885
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Brakes

886
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
I would say

887
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
If anyone

888
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
Is like if you had a high school yearbook and

889
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
You're giving up superlatives

890
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,919
Most likely to come down with Jerusalem syndrome

891
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Alex Jones

892
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
He goes to Jerusalem he used

893
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,807
Iron Man

894
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
That would not be good so I just like

895
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Palestinian

896
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,023
Try to overthrow every country.

897
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,447
Try and Destroy every country

898
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
Disparage

899
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Definitely against every country of course evil and chaotic and Monster

900
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
Nature

901
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
But

902
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Come on

903
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
Also aren't they just

904
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:16,767
We will get back to a lot of this is going to come full circle

905
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Throw Israel so much as

906
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Live

907
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,375
Yeah

908
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:27,519
Important point that Alex brings up in a little bit and we'll get to it

909
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
The biggest problem I have right now is

910
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
He's getting close to the territory of like

911
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Who's there

912
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Are you a Jew

913
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Is that guy jokes

914
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,087
That's a really important distinction to make

915
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
Hold on to that until the next eclipse

916
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,119
Before we do that I want to talk a little bit more about this

917
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Complained the dollar

918
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
What's has about

919
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
These anti-Semitic

920
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,239
Excites Israel

921
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Iza Israel

922
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Like

923
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,895
All of the people that he wants to be in government now

924
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,735
Well he's sort of I mean he nurtures these sort of

925
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
AP

926
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
There's a

927
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
I don't know exactly how to put it

928
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
I think he relishes the idea that

929
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
People make these attacks

930
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
Because then criticism of him is

931
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
That's crazy

932
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,935
Whatever whatever the websites in the world

933
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
And the other half say you works with

934
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
The CIA

935
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,591
Rather like that anybody was a legitimate criticism of him is like

936
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,943
Hey you know his rhetoric is really reminiscent of old anti-semitic Canard

937
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
Angie lies all the time and he keep saying

938
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
In contact with intelligent

939
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Contagion season

940
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,183
Also wanted to be illegal

941
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
You don't get any tracks

942
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,327
That's why memes about him a really successful ever wants to make sense of it

943
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
And I know you like

944
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,911
Actual criticism of him is just loved in with like

945
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,471
Oh you one of those crazies who thinks he works for

946
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,567
It's a

947
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
It like he has

948
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
What's the love it because

949
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Ideologically

950
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
He agrees with everything

951
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
With those

952
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:19,391
Anti-semitic like with a if you're talkin about an anti-israel website all of that is

953
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
All the other race

954
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,791
Will it gives him anti-semitic cover to a certain extent

955
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,375
But that allows him to distance himself

956
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
From

957
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Agreeing with everything

958
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,543
He gets to be like well of course I'm not like Stormfront

959
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
I don't hate Israel

960
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
Israel you agree with everything else Stormfront

961
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
Front cuz they attack me all the time can't you see that were different

962
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,695
I don't agree with David Duke I had them on the show about everything but I pretended I disagreed with

963
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
Like I said

964
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
Nice quote we get into some weird

965
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
Ethnic talk

966
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,751
This is this is really weird it starts with him talking about how

967
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Israelis did test

968
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Did like

969
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Testing

970
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,895
Jewish population

971
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,575
Make a lot of countries have that to a troubling history in their pants

972
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
No one gets pass on it but

973
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,975
Makes me deeply on

974
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,327
And by the way Israel didn't get caught on Arabs

975
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,983
First of all he's saying almost a responsible for everything that happens

976
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,871
Mister jiu's but also in there he's almost saying that if they had

977
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
Which is also I don't like that at all

978
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
Which genetics are true

979
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,135
Undisputed juice

980
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
They are

981
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
Free Arab

982
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
Before African invasions much of the Middle East

983
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,983
Parts of Africa

984
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,543
Artifact that's what heroes are

985
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
First of all

986
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
I don't like I do not like any conversation.

987
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:26,111
Don't like any of that that's not a good wine to go down

988
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
Genetic makeup

989
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Anime

990
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Stop stop

991
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
Please don't do it

992
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:39,167
Scrooge I don't know no no no no

993
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:43,007
Alex Alex Alex Alex Alex

994
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
Penny Ann's

995
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,103
Beginning of it there's more but

996
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
That's what Arabs are there a hybrid

997
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,711
Yeah I don't know

998
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Stop

999
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Please I could have stopped

1000
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Arabs

1001
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
They don't count

1002
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Cuz they're not

1003
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
I didn't mean to say oh boy

1004
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,535
Now what I meant to say is there a hybrid

1005
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
What I meant to say is that their lesser than juice

1006
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Sephardic Jews

1007
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,967
When the world group Europe

1008
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
What is Europe today

1009
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
Ashkenazi Jew

1010
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,255
North of Georgia

1011
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Asian gentleman

1012
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Babylonian captivity

1013
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
You do have an Arab line

1014
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
Genetics images

1015
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
Morton

1016
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
First of all

1017
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,535
He never finishes I thought I'm very curious what it had thought was going to be

1018
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
Powell

1019
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Is it Jews

1020
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,703
Original

1021
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
And then you got

1022
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
What

1023
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
Absolutely

1024
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,599
The public

1025
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,559
Correctly

1026
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
All Jews are white p

1027
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
But not now Jews

1028
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Zerbos

1029
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,007
Arabs are white people is that

1030
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:57,919
Trying to say don't know what you trying to say you should have said was nothing

1031
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
Thanks Mike Birbiglia the only thing that

1032
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,879
Like I can really take away from that clip is that whoever kicked in that music was late

1033
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,719
Music should have come in what earlier

1034
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,791
Feel like I don't know I don't know enough about like

1035
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Genetic fossil records in

1036
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,727
It doesn't really interest me.

1037
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
Into this

1038
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
This sort of

1039
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Discourse

1040
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
And you're acting like it

1041
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
It means anything

1042
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
I think you're already in

1043
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
Bad territory

1044
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
I don't know what point you're trying to make

1045
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,063
I think it needs what you're saying that like these original Jews were from Europe

1046
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
And then they got

1047
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
They're white people and then they got ruined

1048
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,279
By the Arabs I think that's what he's talked about that a lot about the

1049
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
Greeks are only

1050
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
Harry

1051
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,167
Dark-haired because of Muslim Invasion stuff like that

1052
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Which is like

1053
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Hey buddy

1054
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
Cut that out

1055
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,639
That kind of that kind of rhetoric is unnecessary

1056
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Diversity

1057
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,479
End it all

1058
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
And then when you start getting

1059
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,087
Who's a real Jew and who's not a real Jew

1060
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,951
Then we get into real trouble that I think Israel has

1061
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:19,583
And I was not thrilled with it but it's also their conversation to have

1062
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,887
You remain in the same way vet like

1063
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
I guess

1064
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,263
I don't know it makes me uncomfortable no matter what

1065
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
I guess liquor

1066
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
I don't know

1067
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
You have to look at it from an ethnicity and a religion

1068
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
If you want to go with the religion it's

1069
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,015
Totally cool

1070
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,879
Cuz then you're like if you want to be a part of the religion key or the steps you take to get into it or whatever

1071
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
But if you want to go with me

1072
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
The ethnic version

1073
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,767
Nothing's good there nothing is good

1074
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,071
I'm trying to think of a way that it's like

1075
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,143
Yeah I guess it makes sense to exclude people from your group

1076
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,495
Play I don't know

1077
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Exposed

1078
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
I suppose

1079
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
It's like here's the weirdest part about this

1080
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Is that

1081
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
As he is

1082
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Dancing

1083
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
So now are we

1084
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
In a certain

1085
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
Incense is because there's

1086
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,391
What time is it

1087
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
I don't want to

1088
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Mister

1089
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,327
And it's very easy

1090
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,863
Say something about

1091
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:30,751
The Israel situation

1092
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,479
It's so hard to just wait

1093
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
Like there's no there's no

1094
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Easy win on

1095
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,671
So what does if you want to if you want to talk about the the religious

1096
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
The religion

1097
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
And the ethnicity

1098
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,583
To the religion

1099
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
Simply because

1100
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
They've always been

1101
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
Right

1102
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,519
Part of your religion eventually if everybody's trying

1103
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
The kill you has to be like

1104
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
Well

1105
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
We got to stick together

1106
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:12,223
Andrew population

1107
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
Population

1108
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,807
Pressure you know anabaptist

1109
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,879
Were slaughtered and driven out of many places in Europe

1110
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
And so there is like I asked

1111
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
It's not a perfect

1112
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,583
Overlap but like Amish communities are generally of

1113
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Similar

1114
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
That's why they end up with condition

1115
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,823
Seems like maple syrup urea but don't exist in other communities

1116
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,431
That's the right one example cuz I grew up Mennonite

1117
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,967
Can Amish people at 7

1118
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
My buddy's always used

1119
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,063
The bully me about whether my pee smells like maple syrup

1120
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,255
So that's coming from my own pain as a child is that a curse or is it a gift

1121
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
I mean compared to other things

1122
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,119
Pekin smell like

1123
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:07,519
A bunch of populations that have gone through

1124
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,335
It's just that

1125
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
You're not a Baptist

1126
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Don't really have a

1127
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
State

1128
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Nope

1129
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
It makes it much more

1130
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Placated

1131
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
I don't know

1132
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
I mean then you get a

1133
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
You know

1134
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
Sufi

1135
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,535
Muslims you go through

1136
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:36,191
Dammit although all the name population with benedictum of genocide

1137
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
You're going to come to go all the way across

1138
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,591
The board man

1139
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
It's just

1140
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,943
It's just one of those things where

1141
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,503
It's also probably part of why it is

1142
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
Purposely hard

1143
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,159
It to become a practice

1144
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
If you are not Jewish

1145
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,999
If you are not

1146
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Me too.

1147
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Religion

1148
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,655
You can't just start going to the synagogue

1149
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
And be like I'm Jewish

1150
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,727
Like that's not quite how bad

1151
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,103
To what I was talking about process of conversion

1152
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
If you want to go ahead and join a Christian

1153
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:23,039
Church play the wall a little bit but if you want to get more involved

1154
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
The sacrament

1155
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,087
You end up either

1156
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,391
There's rituals that you can do on your own

1157
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
So you're supposed

1158
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,743
To do outside of messerly the form

1159
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,071
If you want to become a member of your church there things you have to

1160
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:40,959
You have to say prayers and stuff probably with the minister religions

1161
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:45,823
Kind of a lot of people a lot of great benefits

1162
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,639
Weston Florida

1163
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,527
I just realized it whenever I take a shower at

1164
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,343
End up with a little bit of a Curly Sue

1165
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
I got a I have a I have a headache

1166
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,047
Clip Alex

1167
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
He's all over

1168
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
Worship Jews

1169
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,495
Boy

1170
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,919
I don't dislike the NFL year

1171
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Israel

1172
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
First of all

1173
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,231
What galaxy are like two episodes of The League

1174
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
Real people

1175
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,375
I think that's probably what he's basing that off of

1176
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
So he has to kind of view the world through his little

1177
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,799
That's window

1178
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,615
Anyway

1179
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Is very bizarre

1180
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Look up at 11

1181
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,759
Even though

1182
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,039
Example is like

1183
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
Trivializing

1184
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,439
Just stop talking about Israel I'm sick of you talking about it

1185
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,071
Go ahead and love the NFL or Israel

1186
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
Which is not dealing with the issue

1187
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Exact

1188
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,495
I'm sick of hearing about it

1189
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,799
I'm sick of all the people on both sides

1190
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:27,711
Vitriolic big

1191
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
You're definitely aren't

1192
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,415
Saudi Arabia

1193
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,143
Every special interest group

1194
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
Show your work

1195
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:54,335
Show your work

1196
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,431
Right and Saudi Arabia and George Soros

1197
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
Nevermind shut down

1198
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Can't take your gun

1199
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
All right here's where this goes

1200
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
But then wouldn't that

1201
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,415
Definition make all of his listeners go

1202
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:14,815
Well then I hate is real out there trying to take our guns

1203
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:19,167
Trying to take our guns

1204
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
Fill in the blank

1205
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,599
And here's the deal we've been doing a great job guys

1206
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,695
I don't want

1207
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
Israel

1208
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
I don't want to

1209
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,191
Bora Bora

1210
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,287
German women

1211
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,615
I'm hearing other babies paid for welfare

1212
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,943
And she has to do it

1213
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
You don't

1214
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
I'm sick of garbage

1215
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,911
By his own

1216
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
He is saying that he is

1217
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
F******

1218
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
Zika virus

1219
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,311
Others

1220
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,223
I'm sick of everybody but the lights are cool

1221
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,063
So if he's sick of unfairness I assume he's full reparation

1222
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
The

1223
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
It's really unfair that

1224
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
You know people

1225
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
I have been

1226
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
I had all of their wealth

1227
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Destroyed

1228
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
And then have been

1229
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
Systematically oppressed

1230
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
For hundreds of years

1231
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,935
So it is unfair everyday

1232
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Like they've been forced

1233
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
I assumed it

1234
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
We have to make

1235
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
You know

1236
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Reparation

1237
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,991
This is foolish

1238
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:15,391
Documented immigrants do not qualify for welfare food stamps most other public

1239
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,743
Also most of those programs require proof of legal immigration

1240
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:24,351
Status

1241
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
Until they've been in the United States for more than

1242
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
In 5 years

1243
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
They're narrow exception

1244
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,567
According to PolitiFact pregnant women and nursing mothers could be eligible

1245
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,383
For certain benefits under the women infants children program

1246
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
WIC

1247
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,943
Which provides food and nutrition voucher

1248
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
The low income

1249
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Some families

1250
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
If they have a child that was born in the United

1251
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,879
Their child could also enroll in Medicaid

1252
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Could not

1253
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
So

1254
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,255
The parents can't get Medicaid they can't get any of those program

1255
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,583
Illegally here but the child can

1256
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:00,703
Because we don't want children dying all over the place are they American

1257
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,383
I looked into it a little bit

1258
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,687
Which is the primary thing that these

1259
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,015
Women who are coming over here in order to

1260
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
Damn the government that's the

1261
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Basic thing that they can get

1262
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
Well if there's one thing I know about government

1263
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Programs

1264
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,975
Designed to help underprivileged

1265
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
People is that they are

1266
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
Steven Lee well-funded

1267
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,583
Do everything that they

1268
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Cantu

1269
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
I helped everybody

1270
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,423
Buddy right there's no

1271
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
Which started in 1974

1272
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
Programming started

1273
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,847
The average monthly food cost

1274
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
A person that was on the program

1275
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
Was $15.68

1276
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
That's not something

1277
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
People are

1278
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Camping

1279
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,087
As much as they are trying to not die

1280
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Month

1281
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:55,743
Monthly $15 so I looked at it a little bit deeper and I found Vapor 2017 we have this

1282
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Statistics

1283
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
Hasbro

1284
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,839
Since 1974

1285
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,167
But the amount the people get monthly

1286
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Under WIC

1287
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
Is $40.78

1288
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,871
$41.24 inflation going back

1289
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,479
$74.76

1290
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
That's compared to

1291
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,551
What it was in 1970

1292
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:24,159
Before now the interesting thing is that over the years that a number of enrollment

1293
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,695
Has gone up quite a bit

1294
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,279
In 1974 when the program started there was 88,000

1295
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
People who are on the pro

1296
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,447
As of 2017 7000286

1297
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Thousand

1298
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,823
Seems like a lot seems Seems like a whole time but if you look at

1299
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Do your numbers again

1300
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
Can you have to look at the totality of the big

1301
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
The number was trending upwards

1302
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Years

1303
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,063
Pete in 2009

1304
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
Wendy conomy crash

1305
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
Will the stock market

1306
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,463
It reached its 59 million 100

1307
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
22000

1308
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Enrollees

1309
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
In the program

1310
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
And since then

1311
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:06,143
With the exception of the next year the next year went up like 50,000 people

1312
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
But since then

1313
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,471
It is trended downward

1314
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
And now there are

1315
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Approximately

1316
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
2 million less people getting it

1317
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,871
Then there were in 2009

1318
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
So Alex's idea

1319
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
Tons of people are coming over here in

1320
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,527
Scamming the government in order to get $9 a month

1321
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
To get food

1322
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
Equivalent to 74

1323
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
$90

1324
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,439
$40 even who cares

1325
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
It's it's

1326
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
In terms of

1327
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
The things that we spend money on

1328
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
Is it embarrassing disgusting

1329
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,399
Use of him just

1330
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
Lying

1331
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,983
About statistics lying about the reality

1332
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
Situation in order to

1333
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Downward

1334
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,079
On disenfranchised people

1335
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,151
Generally speaking when you have these people who are coming over

1336
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
From let's say Mexico or China

1337
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
These women who are coming over

1338
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
Is it coming from China

1339
01:04:54,527 --> 01:05:00,159
Until fairly recently there's a decent chance it was because there's one policy and they might have their kid

1340
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
Coming to America

1341
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
In order to

1342
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Save the life of their child

1343
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
And you're not going to be able to find a job immediately that got a f****** baby

1344
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,727
Give the f****** person $35 a month to get food and formula for their kid

1345
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,287
It's nonsense the idea of

1346
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,591
This making him so mad

1347
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,991
It's also not a program that you can be on I believe more than 5 years I think

1348
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,087
Paid for Trump to stay in his own f****** hotels

1349
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,135
Right right

1350
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
What is wrong with us

1351
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:39,839
America imagine a couple years we will

1352
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,863
Eclipse

1353
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
The total amount we spend on WIC

1354
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,935
On Donald Trump

1355
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,495
I imagine that would be the case

1356
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
One hundred percent

1357
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
So are you can't be on this program forever

1358
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
That's definitely

1359
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Chase

1360
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,199
Even if you do come over

1361
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,479
A pregnant woman

1362
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
And give birth

1363
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
In the United States in order to have your kid get citizenship

1364
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,599
And you get on this

1365
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,415
Sweet sweet scam with money

1366
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
You can't

1367
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,511
Get Medicare you can't get food stamps

1368
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,839
Unless you come over legally and even then you can't get 45

1369
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,655
There are guards in place about this

1370
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,471
It's just such a boogeyman is almost like

1371
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,287
People come over here because they want their

1372
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
Children

1373
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
To have a better

1374
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
Like just about every

1375
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,175
F****** immigrant that America has

1376
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Is ever f******

1377
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,807
Play the country f******

1378
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Started

1379
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,439
Further they want their kid to have a life

1380
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
Because if you're running away from

1381
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:44,351
Terrible situation in the war-torn country or something like that or some place

1382
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:49,727
We're like to look at some of these

1383
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,519
Did the child mortality rate

1384
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
In places like let's say Iraq is

1385
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Rest

1386
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
Eat something to the effect

1387
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
10%

1388
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
Pooping

1389
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,247
Is almost as high as ours

1390
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Ours is not grape

1391
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,319
But it's fine but like a

1392
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,439
Highest in the developed world

1393
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Like that it's

1394
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Not because you want to

1395
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
Scam something

1396
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Because your desk

1397
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
And I don't

1398
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Feel like

1399
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
A great look

1400
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
Turn off

1401
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,287
With the rates of consumption we have in the

1402
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
The

1403
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Has a country to be like

1404
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
I'm sorry sorry

1405
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Yorgo died in that

1406
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,295
Go die where you came from

1407
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Not least of which

1408
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Chances are

1409
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
Chances are they're escaping where they live

1410
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,999
Probably because of something that we did

1411
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
There's a connection

1412
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Further

1413
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,911
2006 record buddy

1414
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
Institute on taxation

1415
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
An economic policy

1416
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
CU left-leaning research

1417
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,031
Found it undocumented

1418
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,823
Rents paid roughly 11 billion in

1419
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,847
State and local taxes

1420
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
In 2030

1421
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,479
Social Security Administration report also cited a 12 billion dollar

1422
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,783
Payroll tax amount I'm outside

1423
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
To undocumented

1424
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Woodworkers

1425
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,975
The Institute on Taxation and economic policy report also estimated the average income of an undocumented family at little more than 30

1426
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Thousand dollars

1427
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,327
Well below the country's median household income of around 54,000

1428
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,143
The report also said that the average tax rate for immigrants

1429
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
To the country

1430
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,751
Illegally is actually higher than the rate paid by America's top

1431
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
Base that we're getting from illegal

1432
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,639
Undocumented immigrant

1433
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,199
Who can't file for tax returns

1434
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
And s*** like that big hits

1435
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
Screwed over with a much higher tax rates

1436
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Bitter rich

1437
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Right there

1438
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,159
Now you understand

1439
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
Bank of America's money that's coming in

1440
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,327
If you look at the amount of money that's coming in

1441
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
It's coming in

1442
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:57,215
From undocumented immigrants here let's say it between 11 and 12 billion dollars

1443
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
Payroll taxes

1444
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
Federal tax

1445
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
If you look at WIC

1446
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,895
Is not only undocumented immigrants

1447
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
It's also citizen

1448
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,247
40 40 bucks

1449
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
So 280 million

1450
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
Knowledge

1451
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:16,671
Because it's total monthly okay it's 5.6 billion dollars

1452
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
Thunder

1453
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Half of

1454
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,791
The amount of money that comes in from taxation of undocumented

1455
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Like this is

1456
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,959
We're playing with numbers a tiny bit here just to give an example

1457
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,775
The point is this is an embarrassment Alex Jones

1458
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:35,871
Is the worst object cruelty masquerading as Financial

1459
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
Anyway

1460
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
Now we come to the shower Alex

1461
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Take some calls

1462
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,647
Kohl's on Israel

1463
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,231
This works colorism

1464
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Oh boy

1465
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,863
What's your phone called in West Virginia

1466
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
Yeah hi Alex

1467
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,703
I watch the

1468
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,287
Excelencia being introduced

1469
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:10,687
Sing like a total dictatorship trying to preach to the US

1470
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,479
Congress and I'm really upsets me

1471
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
I think it was a vice versa that wouldn't happen

1472
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,207
To me it is just a scam but he never did mention what is the good deal

1473
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
What is he so upset about

1474
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,071
What seems to be aggravating him

1475
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,191
For Israel Israel history background

1476
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:37,567
And the things we know we know the Holocaust every year we're constantly reminded of it

1477
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:40,383
We never will be allowed to forget it

1478
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Hoobly

1479
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:47,039
Well yeah I think the phrase is never forget.

1480
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
Forget genocide

1481
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:54,207
Never again was Elie Wiesel quote but

1482
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,535
You can't really have something ever happened

1483
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Hey

1484
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
The towers went down

1485
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,911
That was but I forgot

1486
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:09,311
That the Holocaust it was like it was like 70 years ago dance

1487
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,383
Come on

1488
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,991
What is the deal that you was talkin about

1489
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
Why is he so upset

1490
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,951
A deal is

1491
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:30,303
And not be able to build up an F-bomb

1492
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,631
I pretend

1493
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,911
Not acceptable

1494
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
That's not true

1495
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,983
Acceptable

1496
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,151
Everybody

1497
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,479
Who doesn't have some sort of very weird vested interest in it

1498
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,807
Everybody who's looked at that deal so this is a really good

1499
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
What we did was give her on back

1500
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Their own money

1501
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,487
Right and they agreed to have oversight

1502
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
Of their nuclear

1503
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
Power generating

1504
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
Capabilities

1505
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
Which is something that we couldn't

1506
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,191
Before I fall

1507
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:18,431
International Atomic oversight whatever I would be able to go in

1508
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,479
Check if they were up to no good

1509
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,295
Left it on devices they were

1510
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,391
Trouble in the neighborhood it's entirely possible I'm going up to

1511
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
100%

1512
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,047
Randolph ideal allow the International Community to have oversight

1513
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,607
If we do get rid of it

1514
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
Aniron just gets to do whatever they want

1515
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,471
So that's really stupid the deal was very good deal

1516
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,567
You know what

1517
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:49,407
If I think it might be a smart idea to have nuclear weapons

1518
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
The furor Iran

1519
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
At this point

1520
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
It's like a smoke them if you got them situation

1521
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,623
Right to the point where they no one can attack you quick

1522
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Cuz

1523
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
It's about to pop off

1524
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
We're the ones who

1525
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:09,375
Gave them the authoritarian theocracy that they have now of course they should have nuclear weapons

1526
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,935
Yeah there's a there's real trouble

1527
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
I don't know man

1528
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,311
Foreign policy

1529
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
Easy to solve

1530
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Very much so

1531
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,151
And then Israel will protect

1532
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,511
This is where we get into a very busy

1533
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
Deeply

1534
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,863
Cornerstone a very deeply

1535
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
Anti-semitic political thinking

1536
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,703
A lot of people believe that if yours

1537
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:22,591
Israel you get to run away to Israel if you commit a crime and I'm over here I'm on HomeBase

1538
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:28,991
Dab

1539
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:35,391
Is a real thing

1540
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,255
It's for like high-ranking political officials

1541
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,351
This is the reason why I want Alex Jones was

1542
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,911
Complaining earlier about like all these anti-Semitic

1543
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,215
Israel sites accuse everybody

1544
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519
Is because

1545
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:55,615
People believe that all of these nefarious actors in the world

1546
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,711
Are stirring up trouble and they're secretly Jewish and they're going to run away to Israel

1547
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,831
And this is based on the idea of the right of return

1548
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,135
Are you aware of the right of return

1549
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:11,999
Yeah within 30 to 45 days if you have

1550
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,023
No

1551
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
So

1552
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,351
1950

1553
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,423
Everybody's

1554
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Ethnicity

1555
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Was able

1556
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
To go to

1557
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
Israel

1558
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
And become

1559
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
An Israeli citizen

1560
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
Brett knows the right of return

1561
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
Of the people who were sent out

1562
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,199
Italy dyaspora or whatever

1563
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,039
Not it created an incredibly problematic

1564
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Is that like

1565
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,695
Oh don't the Palestinians have a right to return as well so much

1566
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,279
So they're denying the Palestinians their right to

1567
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,071
Return while at the same time

1568
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,863
If you were let's a Jewish

1569
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,423
You could if you'd like your mother was doing

1570
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
You could

1571
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,007
Right now go to Israel and become a

1572
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,567
Or go to

1573
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
Hollister

1574
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,479
From what I understand Israel's opened it up a little bit even to like

1575
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,807
If you have a maternal grandmother who is Jewish

1576
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,647
You can now go convert to like orthodox

1577
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,415
Judaism UK

1578
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,695
Can gout and become a

1579
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,511
The really expanding the right of return

1580
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,351
In terms of because they want to swell the population have all the settlement

1581
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
This idea

1582
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
Is it crazy

1583
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,615
Like the reality of the right of return stuff

1584
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Is pretty crazy

1585
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,247
If you take the part of it where you're not respecting

1586
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,807
In the Palestinians right to return to their Homeland

1587
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,855
You ignore that part

1588
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:45,183
Mixed disrupted Community after

1589
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,279
The UN has given out this dictate to tons and tons of

1590
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,327
Groups actor

1591
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,399
Like in Serbia after the Serbian war in the 90s

1592
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
People have the right of return

1593
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
It happens over and over again after Wars

1594
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:04,383
Or terrible things like that that isn't nefarious

1595
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
But the way it's being applied

1596
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Nefarious

1597
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
And then Alex's

1598
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,271
Understanding of it as being like

1599
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
Jews have diplomatic immunity

1600
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,647
And they can commit crimes and run away to Israel

1601
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Is

1602
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
Like that's the

1603
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,719
The Cornerstone of

1604
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
Political aunt

1605
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
So now Alex is coming in

1606
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,607
Bonkers Alex is coming in with

1607
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,679
Hot cooked old-timey archaic anti-semitism

1608
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,215
In terms of his beliefs

1609
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
About the Rothschild

1610
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:34,335
And all the blood libel and poisoning the well narratives that we've documented

1611
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,127
Over and over again in the past

1612
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Now he's throwing in a

1613
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,783
Precious

1614
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:48,415
Banana yeah it's pretty crazy

1615
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
Cosmetic blogs

1616
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Confined

1617
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
It's not true

1618
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,303
Of course not

1619
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,631
Can you imagine the very idea of like

1620
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,679
You just commit some crime

1621
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
And then like

1622
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
Israel's going to take the heat for you if you want murderer Israel

1623
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,711
Yeah that's that's real nonsense

1624
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Disallowing

1625
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,903
Because it does reinforce

1626
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
A lot of the

1627
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
Again it's

1628
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,487
It's the cover that he gets

1629
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,767
From these neo-nazis

1630
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,303
Somatic site

1631
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,327
He's allowed to

1632
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Perpetuate

1633
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Is this one

1634
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,471
Very close to home for me

1635
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
Is very

1636
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,103
What you think of Netanyahu speech and what does it distracting us from

1637
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,151
Alan Washington d.c. go ahead

1638
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
Hi good morning

1639
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,759
Welcome to

1640
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,599
Note that Chris Matthews on MSNBC right after the speech.

1641
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:54,463
Too many people were smiling during the Netanyahu speech this another example of

1642
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,023
Partisan division of a China sent you

1643
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
But the bigger picture

1644
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
I think if

1645
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
Who is

1646
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,655
Barack Obama

1647
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959

To a Eugenics think-tank at the East-West Center

1652
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223

1658
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,095
Google

1659
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Hawaii official

To u.s. government eugenics

1663
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,599
He's going to look into it

1664
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,927
Is going to look into it

1665
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,327
Do you think Google has that on autofill can you just type

1666
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,863
Yeah probably

1667
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,679
Set the Ender results for Europe

1668
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,007
When do collar even got back to what he's talking about that

1669
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Is eugenics

1670
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,824
Honolulu called the

1671

East-West Center

1672
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,784
My dad had a three-year Fellowship Center I spent a lot of time at the East-West Center when I was a kid

1673
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,832
Obviously Obama's

1674
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,744
Now that's a conspiracy

1675
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,816
It's not a secret Muslim dance

1676
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:39,424
He took my dad got his Doctorate at Harvard

Biblical Hebrew

1680
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,784
But after that you got a 3-year Fellowship

1681
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,808
When I was growing up

1682
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,160
And it's interesting because

1683
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
Eugenics operation

1684
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
Mostly about

Call the ancestors in post contact religion

1695
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
Sounds like you stole that from Margaret Sanger

1696
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:30,368
Sexually this was this was published later but it's from

1697
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
Research that he was conducting

1698
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
East-West Center

1699
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,864
Conference on ancestors and spirituality

1700
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
Coming to our human

1701
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,912
Experience

1702
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936
We are all descendants

1703
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
We all have ancestors who

1704
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,008
Powerful claims on our lives

1705
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,312
We live in the aftermath of contact with

1706
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,616
Another civilization

1707
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,432
It's now clear the native religions are alive

1708
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,248
Contemporary World Justice

1709
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
Abdominal area

1710
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,320
The phenomenon of ancestors

1711
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,344
Is it common to all human

1712
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Most

1713
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Indigenous

1714
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,952
It's been suppressed in Western culture

1715
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,744
This volume articulates

1716
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
Crucial issues in the study of post contact religion

1717
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Do the themes of ancestral ordering of the world

1718
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
Intense personal attachments

1719
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Forebears

1720
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
And the catastrophes of clock

1721
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,984
Colonization

1722
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
Now

1723
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
You know what's interesting about that

1724
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,080
You just did some Buzz Marketing

1725
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
No

1726
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,640
Alex would love that

1727
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,480
Talking about ancestral

1728
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:36,160
How the West has been disrupted from connected

1729
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,768
I'm going to send them a copy

1730
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,072
Alright

1731
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,120
I just think that's really funny and I mean

1732
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,400
Buckeye

1733
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
Admitted

1734
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
Around the edge

1735
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,312
At the time I couldn't have smelled out

1736
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
A CIA operation

1737
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,664
If my life depended on it

1738
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,272
But everything I know

1739
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,600
Children's book

1740
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,648
All I know is that it

1741
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,928
Not a nefarious up

1742
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,488
I've talked to my dad quite a bit about it

1743
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
Eugenicist

1744
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,032
Where to take a quick break with this next clip where Alex

1745
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
Take people with

1746
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,992
Austin Chronicle

1747
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:36,320
I turn on television

1748
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,952
Alex talks about a Cop going to rob you all the time

1749
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,768
He's very against eminent domain is very again

1750
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,864
The seizures that you can make

1751
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,680
Can make if they suspect you of a crime stuff like that

1752
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:58,080
Vegetable asset forfeiture complains about cops robbing you quite a bit

1753
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
I don't know what he's going to

1754
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
Power Trip

1755
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
I don't know if he was

1756
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,184
I don't think he had a bad

1757
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
Yosemite Sam

1758
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:23,168
Oh yeah I think it was a prospector of some sort

1759
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Don't violate my first amendment

1760
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Person

1761
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,760
I am not going to just sit here

1762
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,064
Focused at the police

1763
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Veterans

1764
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,672
They hate people trying to use weapons

1765
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,256
They hate the police

1766
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,792
Everything

1767
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,912
Sunday

1768
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,216
Will not

1769
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,032
Along with that piece of trash

1770
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:04,128
I see through everything

1771
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
I really did

1772
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:15,136
And you can see their battle plan all over the place

1773
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,672
We reform our police

1774
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,464
Everything bad

1775
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,752
Instant shooting

1776
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,312
Demonization of Patriots

1777
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
The globalist have occupied the federal government

1778
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
Police

1779
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
Couple things

1780
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
No

1781
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,320
Checkpoints

1782
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,856
Generally speaking Arabic

1783
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
Because they don't have the money

1784
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:51,488
And they're trying to

1785
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,256
Like that

1786
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,328
That's not the feds coming

1787
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,376
That's we need to pay our budgets and

1788
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,984
Beyond that I think everyone has tasers

1789
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
I don't know

1790
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
He's talked about

1791
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:10,432
And generally speaking it's not the federal police or the federal authorities were coming in and teaching

1792
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,224
People hey go ahead and shoot people

1793
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,320
It's the local cops and Upstream people and then the feds coming to be like

1794
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,904
We got to deal with this

1795
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,768
Dog the doj investigate

1796
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
Dallas cops

1797
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,840
Well at least

1798
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
The federal government doesn't

1799
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
Give these cops

1800
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
All of this militarized bulshit

1801
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
The cops

1802
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
The Patriot

1803
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,968
You need to be very careful

1804
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Because

1805
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,528
But they're talking

1806
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
The feds

1807
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,856
Are sovereign citizen

1808
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,440
If you want a lump your s*** in with them

1809
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,744
Then you're going to have to take on with Vape

1810
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,536
And what they do

1811
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
Is kill cops

1812
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,376
For all his talk about like

1813
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,960
You know black lives matter being all about cop killing and what have you

1814
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Breakdown

1815
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
Stats on the number

1816
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,568
Attacks on police that are done by Sovereign citizen

1817
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
The number is much higher

1818
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,944
And so when the feds are like hey you got to be careful about these

1819
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,528
They are very wild

1820
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,112
They don't think you have any Authority and they also don't carry ID

1821
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,648
Also they don't think

1822
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
They have guns

1823
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,464
And they use them

1824
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,304
So that if it's Federal authorities want to come in in

1825
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
People how to

1826
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
Deescalate those situations

1827
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Think it's

1828
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,984
Also I'm thrilled to report to Yosemite Sam

1829
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
Is generally

1830
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,080
Depicted as a prospector Outlaw pirate or cowboy

1831
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
He's not a cop

1832
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Apparently

1833
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Sometime is a pirate

1834
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
I want that

1835
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:53,088
Alex Jones is having a conversation with one

1836
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,880
Climate expert

1837
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,440
Something to talk for a little bit

1838
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,768
They don't talk about the talk about climate change.

1839
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,792
But I've got that out

1840
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,816
Cuz it's stupid

1841
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,520
Enclosing on the subject why won't the feminist

1842
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,896
All sexy

1843
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:21,248
No one

1844
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,856
Girls

1845
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,256
If you got all that this meeting there are folks

1846
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:39,424
Jihad

1847
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
Instant

1848
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
Grapes

1849
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,040
Alex Jones

1850
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
Anyting

1851
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,088
Furiated

1852
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,624
Yeah

1853
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Ulta

1854
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Calipari

1855
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
Just buy

1856
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
Talking

1857
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,000
Lord monckton

1858
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
F******

1859
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,888
B**** one of the things that Alex really never takes

1860
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
Into consideration is that like

1861
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,240
Or you not he knows this but he never announces it

1862
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
It is like Lord monckton was

1863
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
Huge player in you

1864
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
But he's a really big part of the

1865
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
UK

1866
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,664
Party

1867
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,504
I could never have guessed that he was

1868
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,040
In charge of it

1869
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Copperajah

1870
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,440
But I want to tell you a little bit more about Lord Martin cuz Let's ignore that dump

1871
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:38,304
I think we can dismiss it by saying that Asians and people on the left

1872
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,328
Two are actually

1873
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
Working again

1874
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
The things you're complaining about

1875
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,984
Well you just score points pretending no one is working again

1876
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,568
Some fun things I learned about

1877
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Mocked and recently

1878
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
What's up

1879
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,176
Lord monckton erroneously claimed

1880
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,248
To be a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore

1881
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,296
And the ipcc because

1882
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,136
He claims he sent them a letter pointing out something that needed to be fixed in a draft

1883
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,184
Of their submission

1884
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,208
For the Nobel Peace

1885
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,768
So you're in the Nobel Peace Prize along with

1886
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,912
When asked about it but it is still in his bio

1887
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,032
Back in 2012 at the UN climate talks

1888
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,872
Impersonated a Burmese delegate

1889
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,688
To crash the event and save it climate change is happening

1890
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,016
He was thrown out and banned for life

1891
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
Good

1892
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,904
So he also claimed that Margaret Thatcher spikes

1893
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
Trying

1894
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,464
Do you think he tried to do it

1895
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Oh yeah

1896
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:44,096
Actually watch the video that he says like a salaam alaikum

1897
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,120
No

1898
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,800
I don't know I don't know what like

1899
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:58,944
He also advocated that Margaret Thatcher's Spike the argentines water with mild bacillus

1900
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,760
Would have an easy win in the Falklands War

1901
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,808
This would be a huge violation of the night

1902
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,344
T-72 biological weapon

1903
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:09,696
He's also advocated for outlawing portions of the Quran

1904
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,328
He's claimed that he has a miracle cure that can handle pretty much everything

1905
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
Hiv-2,

1906
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Cold

1907
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,936
Herpes viruses everything

1908
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,960
In his defense

1909
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,008
Infatuated

1910
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,592
He he he has created this miracle cure as applied for

1911
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,896
For every year from 2008

1912
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,456
The 2013 at least

1913
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,528
But he let the patent laps every year and then reapply

1914
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,552
He never asked

1915
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,576
To prove that the facts

1916
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,392
I love you scaring people with it

1917
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:45,536
Also Moncton Lord monckton was a cheap

1918
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:49,120
I think tank operated by the frontiers of Freedom Foundation

1919
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:53,472
After years where the data is available between 2002-2007

1920
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:58,336
ExxonMobil frontiers of Freedom Foundation over $1000000

1921
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,360
Pinterest

1922
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
The news again

1923
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
Climate change

1924
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,944
Also

1925
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,992
Where is Vestas really funny

1926
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
He

1927
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,368
He claims that he's a member of the House of Lords

1928
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
Is that why he called

1929
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,024
Technically did inherit

1930
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
The title

1931
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,328
From somebody

1932
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,400
He claims it's a House of Lords member of the House of Lords

1933
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:28,800
But the letter

1934
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:38,528
That they posted the season desist letter on the parliament's website

1935
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:42,368
Lord monckton is a

1936
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,416
Distance scam artist

1937
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,976
Either I learned all the stuff I like

1938
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
The house of

1939
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,584
Lourdes doesn't want you not at all really bad

1940
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:03,104
Lord Marksman is come up and we learn about history

1941
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
People everybody Alex Jones has on his

1942
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Con artist

1943
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,224
They're all just people who can't go anywhere else

1944
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,040
No one will have them because they've burned all their Bridges

1945
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
You asked earlier

1946
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
How's Alex going to deal with the fact that he

1947
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
Can't side with Obama

1948
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,000
You're sorry.

1949
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,448
A great match

1950
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:31,776
Mama

1951
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:38,176
Everything Obama does his mama on the surface Israel

1952
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
There's just major stuff

1953
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:44,832
Your stops going on

1954
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:53,024
Do you want support the transmission

1955
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
Great

1956
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,520
I've been raised cuz we haven't heard an ad

1957
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
Sounds like

1958
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,688
Cuz he's too confused by where to land and then also he's going on these weird diatribes about ethnic origin

1959
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
That's such a

1960
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,064
Perfect

1961
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
Summation of how

1962
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,184
The right views Obama

1963
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
As

1964
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
Everything he does is bad

1965
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,256
Doesn't matter

1966
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,096
Possible

1967
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,632
To compromise to

1968
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
Respect

1969
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
Everything he does

1970
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,752
Which is insane

1971
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
And it does

1972
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,544
Feel like

1973
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
I don't think I can

1974
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Prove this

1975
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,896
Feels like they're working

1976
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
Going backwards

1977
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
I'm saying like

1978
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,552
Started with this We can't agree on anything they have

1979
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,856
Well then they filled in the blanks and Alex's

1980
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Really great

1981
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,696
Defied not agreeing with him by being like

1982
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,792
Because he has a fake dad who's a

1983
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
Socialist

1984
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,400
The Soviets who is diagnosed

1985
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,936
Indoctrinated him in

1986
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,984
Cultural Marxism

1987
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
But also trying to

1988
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,128
Create a caliphate Islamic rule

1989
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,664
Rain in the United States

1990
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
Backwards

1991
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,712
The train just

1992
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
25 in Evergreen

1993
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
As opposed

1994
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
Stabbing like a maybe

1995
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,832
Con man I keep talking

1996
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:26,208
You are wrong all of my guests are con men and psychic Warfare guys

1997
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,744
But Obama's

1998
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,536
Or just straight-up crazy

1999
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,120
Anyway we get to another Colorado

2000
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,656
Listcrawlers

2001
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Librarian

2002
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,336
You looking at the Six Days War after they establish their state

2003
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,616
I mean

2004
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,664
To my eyes that was just

2005
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
That mean God and do

2006
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,552
Providence

2007
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
I mean

2008
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:00,000
They were surrounded then and look what they accomplished by themselves

2009
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
Do not go by themselves

2010
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,400
That's what I think that's right and that's why people

2011
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
It's not going to happen

2012
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:22,016
Yeah it's important to have both of those nuclear weapons are great

2013
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,296
The Providence of the

2014
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:29,696
Christian

2015
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
God

2016
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,000
Sono

2017
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,024
F****** stupid

2018
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,424
This is where I wanted to get back to the nationalism

2019
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,496
Most advanced

2020
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:48,896
Text military technology that we are you shiting me

2021
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,688
Fighting people on horseback

2022
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
F******

2023
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,272
Sane what is why

2024
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
Providence Providence

2025
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:02,720
So I want to go back to the everybody views the world is like

2026
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
Which is this weird National

2027
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,840
Israel has Providence

2028
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Switches divine

2029
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,936
Basically

2030
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:15,008
I wanted to read a little bit here from

2031
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
Zinn Road in 2000

2032
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,592
15in essay called the scourge of national

2033
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,640
I think it's very pointed

2034
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
I think it's in Port

2035
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:25,760
Our citizen has been brought up to see our nation is different from others

2036
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Exception in the world uniquely moral

2037
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
Expanding into other lands

2038
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,624
In order to bring civilization

2039
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
Can Liberty democracy

2040
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,952
That self-deception started early

2041
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,024
When the first English settlers moved into Indian land in Massachusetts

2042
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:41,120
The violence escalated into war with a peacoat in

2043
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,472
The killing of Indians was seeing is approved by God The Taking of land

2044
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,752
As commanded by the Bible

2045
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
The Puritan

2046
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,312
Cited one of the Psalms

2047
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,640
Ask of me and I shall

2048
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
Give thee

2049
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,200
The Heathen for thine inheritance

2050
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Uttermost parts

2051
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,272
Upper thigh possess

2052
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,880
When English set fire to a peacoat Village in massacred men women and children

2053
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,672
Theologian Cotton Mather said

2054
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,464
He was supposed that no less than five

2055
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
600D code solos

2056
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
We're brought down

2057
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
The hell that day

2058
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
It was our manifest destiny

2059
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,632
Sunita overspread the continent allotted by Providence

2060
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
An American journalist

2061
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,448
Declared on the eve of the next

2062
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,520
Is after the invasion of Mexico began

2063
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,056
The New York Herald announce quote

2064
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,592
We believe it's part of our desk

2065
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
Civilized

2066
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,640
Country

2067
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:28,480
It was always supposedly for benign purposes that our country went to war

2068
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,040
We invaded Cuba in 1898 to liberate

2069
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,600
The Cubans in the Philippines shortly after

2070
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,136
Is President McKinley put it

2071
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,696
To civilize and christianize the Filipino people

2072
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,256
As our armies were committing massacres in

2073
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,024
In the Philippines

2074
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
At least 600,000 Filipinos died

2075
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,096
70 years of Compton

2076
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,376
Elihu root

2077
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,168
Or Secretary of War was saying

2078
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
The American soldiers differ

2079
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,472
Cancel the other soldiers

2080
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,520
Of all other countries since the War Began

2081
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,824
Give the advance guard of liberty and justice

2082
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
In order

2083
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,128
Peace and happiness

2084
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
Devin says Liberty like math

2085
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,968
Nationalism is given a special

2086
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,992
Special virulence

2087
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,528
When it's black by prophet

2088
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,832
That's the point I wanted

2089
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
Really drive home

2090
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,392
Hey

2091
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,416
God says

2092
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:12,000
Whenever you mix those two things together which Alex Jones does

2093
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,536
All the time

2094
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:18,144
You get into a really murky territory wearing you're not only like I'm the best

2095
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,168
Did the Gods

2096
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
I'm the best

2097
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,240
And that's a f*****-up

2098
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
To put yourself in

2099
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
Cuz there's other countries

2100
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,568
In the world hey.

2101
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
Nope

2102
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,896
There aren't even other people

2103
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,200
And if there are and they don't believe in God

2104
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:36,832
Well they didn't they're not protected by Providence

2105
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:40,928
Nothing I know if there's one thing I know about Jesus

2106
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
It's at 1

2107
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,512
He was a secret Muslim right

2108
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,560
He loved Massacre

2109
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,096
Totally huge thing

2110
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
Can we just not call themselves

2111
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,448
Christian's like I think it'd be fine if they called themselves

2112
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,984
Weird biblical little

2113
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
Maybe Old Testament motherfukers

2114
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,408
Oh no

2115
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,944
F****** assholes

2116
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
Seems most fitting

2117
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:09,344
So it's kind of ironic that Alex Goes To Break

2118
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,160
I'm back from break a little bit later today

2119
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,792
What type of talk radio weed Pioneers simulcasting television not just a webcam

2120
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:22,912
Theoretically show video clips news articles

2121
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,824
Hahaha hahaha hahaha

2122
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,176
Spectrum Gaston who don't even ideologically

2123
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,272
Hahaha

2124
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,064
80%

2125
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,368
But who genuinely want freedom

2126
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,416
Shomer experts in their field

2127
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:47,488
And also seem to be angry white men

2128
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
With a couple of

2129
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Charlotte iserbyt

2130
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,728
Real discussion

2131
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,800
Charizard

2132
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:07,200
The Democratic party especially

2133
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,272
The country

2134
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:14,112
Really want us on our knees

2135
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,904
The terms of our surrender

2136
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,208
And

2137
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:22,560
They just hate this country because we were a Christian Nation were free market

2138
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,888
Alex

2139
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,168
Prove that

2140
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,984
He says he document everything you guys like

2141
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,008
Recite we got this

2142
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,800
Broadcast like this weekend

2143
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:35,616
Compulsively put up documents in Arabic

2144
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:38,944
Neurotically even prove any of his claims

2145
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,968
I watched

2146
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,248
This s*** like

2147
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,320
Primarily an audio video that I watched

2148
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,904
What are we flash stuff up on screen

2149
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,184
It's just a Wikipedia

2150
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:55,072
If you want to talk about zoom in so you can read it I can't wait till we do this

2151
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:55,840
Because I

2152
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,608
I can't wait

2153
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,400
Explain to you and our listeners

2154
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
Just how bad Alex Jones is

2155
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,800
Is in terms of citing sources for the claims that he makes

2156
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,336
Holyshit

2157
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,384
It wouldn't fly in a junior high

2158
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,664
Quite frankly

2159
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,320
Stop.

2160
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
Total b*******

2161
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Totalboat

2162
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,184
Joel Gilbert

2163
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,208
On

2164
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
Is a documentarian

2165
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,840
And I believe he's the guy who made Dreams of My real father

2166
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:34,496
Which is the documentary in heavy quilt

2167
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,824
Pornographer

2168
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,640
I am secretly a Muslim

2169
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,224
I mean look

2170
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,248
Watch part of

2171
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Documentary

2172
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,576
I just turned it off cuz I was very bored

2173
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,136
But like I find it to be

2174
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Troubling

2175
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,536
I just

2176
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
Think

2177
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:03,424
When you hear these people talk about why they think

2178
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,984
Frank Marshall Davis is his dad

2179
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,544
It really makes me uncomfortable

2180
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
Cuz they talk about like

2181
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:14,944
Obama's dad doesn't look like him but he looks a lot like Frank Marshall Davis

2182
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,712
Do you like

2183
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,528
Just feel real weird

2184
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
Because I don't really

2185
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,600
Thinking Obama.

2186
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,648
Resemblance

2187
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,256
Argument

2188
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,072
Seems racial exactly

2189
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,960
Engage with that and then the only other evidence

2190
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:43,360
The pineapple now I don't think his dad

2191
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:46,432
Other things

2192
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,248
Just like all the circumstantial b******* about like

2193
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,272
His mom was friend

2194
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,552
Frank Marshall Davis

2195
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Who cares

2196
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,392
Nothing is concrete

2197
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
It's buried

2198
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,440
It makes me very uncomfortable

2199
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,000
And so this guy

2200
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,280
This guy is Joel Gilbert

2201
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,072
His maid a new documentary

2202
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
Is pimping is called

2203
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:06,144
No place like Utopia

2204
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,448
About how all of Obama's prom

2205
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
Promises are

2206
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,800
They want to tell you that those Utopia the trigger

2207
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
Provide

2208
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
It ain't come

2209
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,128
I thought it was about how

2210
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,152
Frank Marshall Davis

2211
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
Judy Garland

2212
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
As well

2213
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,272
The next document that's worth

2214
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,088
No place like the Dreams of My Father

2215
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:31,744
Sound whenever I been around

2216
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,424
Criminal

2217
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:44,288
I've been around before

2218
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,336
Behind the scenes don't listen

2219
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,408
Blood

2220
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,968
They really are.

2221
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,952
Grandma progressivism

2222
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,000
Is based on this information

2223
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,840
And that's what the Democrat Party in the White House

2224
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,936
There's voter suppression

2225
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
A completely made-up story

2226
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,520
Bulshit

2227
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,080
That is a real

2228
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Thing to say when

2229
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,408
All the studies of

2230
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,432
Don Chao

2231
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,224
Ridiculous gerrymandering

2232
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,528
What am I

2233
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:31,392
From voter rolls

2234
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
That sort of thing

2235
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:36,512
Interesting things you can do that is you can look in

2236
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,048
Into the

2237
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:38,816
Should have the right to vote

2238
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,912
Especially different argument about life

2239
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
Nonviolent felons especially

2240
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:48,288
Violent felons maybe murderers Maybe

2241
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872
Baby I don't know

2242
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:58,272
I think you could murder somebody and still have a relevant opinion on

2243
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
The minimum

2244
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
Alternative income tax

2245
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:06,976
I agree that there are crazy or people who have not murdered then some people who have

2246
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,512
But I don't know I don't know

2247
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,864
I would rather o.j. Simpson

2248
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,632
Then Alex

2249
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:17,216
Gilbert here is talking about this information on

2250
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,752
A disinformation broadcast

2251
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
If you want to get

2252
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,360
To real information you can look at

2253
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,896
Entirety

2254
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,920
Obama's

2255
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
Cuz it's over

2256
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
It's over now

2257
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,552
Oh you can look at all and you can look at what happened

2258
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,576
Under his

2259
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
Presidency

2260
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,392
Wow

2261
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:41,792
President Obama addressed Americans widespread persistent economic anxiety Donald Trump

2262
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,584
Might not be celebrating his inauguration

2263
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,608
Almost there

2264
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:49,472
One with enough money to invest in the stock market had plenty to celebrate under the outgoing president

2265
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,264
US Stocks Rose an average of

2266
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,824
Propresenter

2267
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,848
S&P global

2268
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
Is an article out of Fortune

2269
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:03,296
That ranks Obama third among the 12 men who've served as president that's World War

2270
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,064
P500

2271
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,344
Only Bill Clinton

Presided over better Market

2276
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,704
So if you

2277
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,496
No buts

2278
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,776
Bill Clinton Obama

2279
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
Best

2280
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,080
In terms of the stock market

2281
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:32,480
That we don't need to talk about you know that's not really a reflection of the actual economy

2282
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,296
But you want to look at even more number

2283
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,600
This is out of

2284
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:41,696
11.5 million jobs

2285
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
In Obama's 8 years

2286
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,256
The unemployment rate dropped

2287
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,792
Tupelo historical norms

2288
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:50,400
Average weekly earnings were all workers were up 4.1% after inflation

2289
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
The game was 3.7%

2290
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
For just for duck

2291
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,752
Non-supervisory employee

2292
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:58,592
After-tax corporate profits also set records as did stock price

2293
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,896
The S&P 500 Index Rose

2294
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
166

2295
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:05,760
The number of people lacking healthcare insurance drop by 15 million

2296
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,296
Premiums Rose

2297
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:09,600
But more slowly than they were before

2298
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,392
When Alex wants to play the chief

2299
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
F****** game but how

2300
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,440
Premium

2301
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:18,048
Arose during Obama's administration

2302
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
They Rose 90%.

2303
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,120
George W bush

2304
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,912
So that

2305
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,752
The only thing that you really end up with

2306
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,520
It's kind of like

2307
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
Like negative stuff for Alex's that home prices

2308
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,592
Cuz Rose

2309
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,128
And homeownership rate drop

2310
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,152
Which is

2311
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,248
Kind of because in 2009 that was a big part of why the economy

2312
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,576
I was still in a recovery in terms of that

2313
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,624
Maybe coming maybe

2314
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:46,976
Almost certainly won't happen also illegal immigration declined

2315
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
Was 8 years

2316
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,608
35% fewer people were caught trying to enter the US for Mexico during that time

2317
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,400
Also Alex Jones should be thrilled

2318
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:57,472
Production of handguns Rose 192%

2319
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,032
To a record level a black man

2320
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:07,456
The murder rate dropped to the lowest on record in 2014 then Rose

2321
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,272
Is my Obama took off

2322
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
Conserve those balls

2323
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:12,576
Gesso

2324
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,856
Remind me to Salt Lake

2325
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
Play Call of the

2326
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,184
The stuff that he's talking about all of this missing

2327
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,464
Information

2328
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,488
Information

2329
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:23,072
Cold hard facts

2330
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
Are the

2331
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,400
By which they measure thing

2332
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:30,240
But I don't necessarily agree are all the real things we should be

2333
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,032
Basing Oliver measurements on

2334
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,568
We're so much better

2335
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,128
Obama

2336
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,224
Billionaires didn't get it

2337
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:44,576
Yeah that's

2338
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:45,600
Yeah I guess so

2339
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
And so

2340
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,696
I told you so

2341
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,768
It's like I don't even

2342
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:55,584
I'm just glad Alex Jones documents always playing

2343
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,424
I'm just glad that he has guys on saying all this b*******

2344
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,192
That's not true

2345
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,264
If you were

2346
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,288
Heated loud enough

2347
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,568
Dumb people

2348
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
Doodling

2349
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Itself

2350
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,664
Hitler had a quote about that

2351
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,248
Anyway

2352
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,320
Another clip from Joel Gilbert here so Whole Lotta

2353
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,088
Thought bulshit

2354
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,512
According to

2355
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:30,912
Exmark

2356
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,824
Everybody's fighting for the door

2357
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,384
All these different special interest groups

2358
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,736
Faro support

2359
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,624
So sick

2360
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,976
People don't realize

2361
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,256
On Earth

2362
01:50:56,512 --> 01:51:01,376
Is America before Barack Obama America as a constitutional government

2363
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
With

2364
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
Free market

2365
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,472
It's free speech limited government

2366
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,104
The Americans

2367
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,688
Razor shaving

2368
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,808
Most unhealthy highest death

2369
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,856
All sorts of

2370
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,928
Exactly

2371
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:28,000
Michelle Obama Barack Obama

2372
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,536
They cannot

2373
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,840
Justify

2374
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:35,424
If everything is going great if we have free market

2375
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,216
And a great economy

2376
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
They have to tell us that

2377
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,288
Everything Is Broken

2378
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,824
Immigration

2379
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,384
Everything's embarrassing

2380
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,688
And their solution is give us the power

2381
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,224
And we'll make it right

2382
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,528
Realize what they're doing

2383
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,856
Externalizing their own psyche

2384
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,416
That's entirely what that's it that is

2385
01:51:57,184 --> 01:52:03,328
The idea that like Obama has to lie about all this stuff to justify the things he's doing

2386
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,864
You're doing in order to just

2387
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,632
Sapphire big

2388
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:10,240
That's why they that's why they

2389
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,776
Have to believe this.

2390
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,800
Is because

2391
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
Cannot

2392
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,592
Except that

2393
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,616
Other people don't

2394
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:19,456
Do what they think that way

2395
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:21,504
Except

2396
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,064
Money-wise

2397
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,648
He was not a secret socialist trying to destroy the

2398
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:34,048
He was the exact opposite which is why we're in the situation we are now well I mean if you was less competent we wouldn't be

2399
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:36,096
In the situation we're in now the crisis

2400
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,376
2009 Wood Ave

2401
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,144
Extended

2402
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,192
It probably gotten way worse

2403
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:44,032
We're in the position we're in because of the competence in great leaders

2404
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,848
Louisiana much better position working

2405
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:50,176
Some sort of a bizarre

2406
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:53,760
There would have been still many more Public Works program

2407
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,832
You already f****** Bridges need to be restored

2408
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,624
Massive debt

2409
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,184
Absolutely

2410
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,256
For people to buy home

2411
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:07,840
Forgive College loan debt now to this stupid idea of

2412
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,728
Socialist

2413
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,520
Firebrand or whatever

2414
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:18,592
Utopia that we

2415
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
We had before Obama

2416
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,176
Yeah which which one

2417
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,224
What the f*** is he talking

2418
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:29,344
Name a Utopia before broccoli

2419
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:36,512
Is that really mean is not what he saying like Obama came in and destroyed everything I guess that's

2420
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,792
Must be what he's talkin

2421
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,608
I mean I'm sure it didn't have anything to do with George Bush's

2422
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:42,144
Massive tax cuts

2423
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,448
I'm sure there's no way that the

2424
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:47,776
F****** deregulation of everything

2425
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,800
Under his f***

2426
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:54,688
King Reign sure there's no utopian

2427
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,736
Until Obama took it over

2428
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,832
When

2429
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,600
The country

2430
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:03,648
Consistently had growth

2431
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:10,304
Whenever is secret socialist was the president when he was almost assassinated by

2432
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,120
But like I think

2433
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,680
Do you know why we have

2434
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,008
Because whenever we had a

2435
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,288
Complete free market

2436
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,824
There was a massive

2437
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
Market crash

2438
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,272
Because of the deregulation of the stock market

2439
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:32,576
It's going to lead to the neck

2440
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,624
Crisis

2441
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
If we didn't learn any

2442
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,928
Anything from 2000

2443
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,744
Whatever we had the last

2444
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,048
Which we obviously didn't learn anything about what

2445
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,096
The last financial crisis

2446
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,632
A f****** 1980

2447
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,936
7

2448
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,472
People are so goddamn

2449
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:59,456
Driving me insane clearly

2450
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:03,040
They're saying that we're the ones at fault

2451
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:06,112
I can't watch it don't you

2452
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,928
You should be able to Process Equipment

2453
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:14,304
Because it is just in this

2454
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,328
Milia

2455
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:18,656
Of blaming the victim it's all of this stuff

2456
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,984
These Chinese women were coming over here to have their baby

2457
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,824
Blame them blame them blame the poor for not

2458
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,360
Picking themselves up by their boots

2459
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,152
I don't work hard enough

2460
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
Sure they have

2461
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,712
Three jobs in works

2462
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,480
60 hours a week

2463
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:39,904
That's laziness if they were really working they would be rich by now everybody knows

2464
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:47,840
You don't really need to criticize him for

2465
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:50,400
The way Obama traded people it really was

2466
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:53,472
Isn't that you f****** tea party losing their goddamn Minds

2467
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,264
To the point where there's a guy screaming

2468
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,568
You lie at the president

2469
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,360
I'm in trunk comes in and he's like

2470
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:02,176
People didn't clap for me so their treasonous

2471
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,480
50s f****** insane

2472
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Hate I hate them so much

2473
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,576
That's the one thing

2474
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,648
The biggest problem that I had with Obama

2475
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,696
Is the same problem that I have with

2476
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,720
The Democratic Party

2477
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,256
Since f****** bill

2478
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:19,328
Which is this idea of like

2479
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,352
Compromised

2480
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:26,752
They should be ignored

2481
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:29,824
Can't communicate with people who say things like

2482
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,896
Everything Obama does wrong there's no communication

2483
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:39,296
That's not a conversation you cannot compromise with somebody who is pitching

2484
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:41,088
Using it

2485
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:45,952
Possible for you to do something good it's an impossible starting point to engage with

2486
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,488
Because once you

2487
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,536
Join in my conversation

2488
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:52,352
You have to exert so much forced

2489
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
To get any

2490
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,424
Reasonable thing out of it you know

2491
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,192
Like

2492
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:59,008
You can't come to the table in a negotiation with

2493
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:04,128
I refuse to believe anything you say well alright well this is not going to go well

2494
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,712
Anybody but like time there's like a profile or a

2495
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,736
Pieces like

2496
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,040
We need to understand these people it's like no

2497
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:13,344
We understand that them

2498
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,440
Ignore the one of the problems was that

2499
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:21,792
I don't think enough people there were a lot of people who were sounding the alarm on this

2500
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:22,816
It's too bad that

2501
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:26,144
Most people and perhaps myself included even I wasn't really

2502
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:26,912
Paying attention

2503
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,448
As closely as I should have but

2504
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:33,056
People didn't understand what was happening in terms of the Overton window being moved

2505
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:35,104
Wow the people on the right working

2506
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,408
Complaining about the Overton window moving

2507
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,456
Removing it

2508
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:41,504
That hard to the right

2509
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:44,576
To the point now where we're in the situation

2510
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
You were just

2511
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
Screaming about

2512
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,416
Acceptable

2513
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:53,280
Very acceptable pieces about weather

2514
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:58,400
Sargon of asgaard is just some sort of Mary a YouTuber as opposed to a

2515
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,192
Out-and-out racist white

2516
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,984
You have these conversations

2517
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:05,312
Think about whether these commenters are commentators are mainstream

2518
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:07,360
Is Jack Paseo be a journalist

2519
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,176
Like these sorts of conversation shouldn't be happening

2520
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,992
Write the idea that anybody like when

2521
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,832
When Alex Jones had that charade of him getting press credentials

2522
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,648
No one should have taken that seriously

2523
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,440
Like no one should have been like

2524
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,976
Are we going to

2525
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,512
Alex Jones

2526
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:28,608
Is a journalist

2527
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,632
Career well

2528
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:33,216
Definitely now is a good time to see if you're trustworthy it's important to pay attention

2529
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:36,288
Attention to these people but you have to treat them like what they are

2530
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,592
Play you can't ever give any respect

2531
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:42,944
I4ni now I sound like what you were just describing

2532
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,760
I would say

2533
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,064
In our Gear Long treatment of Alex

2534
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
Giving him credit where credit

2535
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,120
He's generally

2536
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
Propey

2537
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,752
Goodnight interventionist

2538
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:10,848
Comes along

2539
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,384
So I mean there are things

2540
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:16,480
I could come to the table with that in terms of like we agree on this

2541
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,528
And hope for some sort of a conversation

2542
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,808
You can.

2543
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,088
Nada

2544
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:24,160
Do you know why because you're a liberal

2545
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:30,560
Your liberal so you come to the table and you say hey Gris with you we shouldn't be f****** fighting

2546
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:33,632
Wars in Iraq Anita Blake

2547
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,680
You're right we should be

2548
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:39,520
Flip it on them

2549
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,080
Stupid Alex Jones

2550
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,408
Seeing something

2551
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:47,200
Senior stimulus in the wild

2552
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,992
And completely misrepresented

2553
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,808
Go to Whole Foods and places

2554
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,952
But you see the magazines

2555
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
Learning to have less

2556
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:01,536
Suggest

2557
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,864
Probably those magazines a response to people haven't

2558
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,704
How do you how do you live on a budget

2559
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,776
As opposed to making that an attractive way to live

2560
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,056
Anyway

2561
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:18,176
That's catering to a market as opposed to creative

2562
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,200
Comparison essay

2563
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,248
Right thing to say at this point

2564
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,576
You should not celebrate

2565
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,368
GoFundMe campaign

2566
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,392
Finally making

2567
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,416
Enough money to get some

2568
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
Somebody to pay for

2569
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,744
That's how they celebrate

2570
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,024
That's the saddest

2571
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:34,560
Quite quite

2572
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:38,912
Continues from there and then Alex gets

2573
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:39,936
Sent you a call that

2574
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,960
He accidentally reveals

2575
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:41,984
Very fun

2576
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,752
F****** weird at the end

2577
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:45,056
While they charge

2578
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:47,616
So much

2579
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:50,176
Nice pictures

2580
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:55,040
You can

2581
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,856
Let's go

2582
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,648
Thank you for holding your on here

2583
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:03,744
Thank you for a long time my Prison Planet 2

2584
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,632
Yahoo

2585
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:13,216
America win

2586
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,776
Useless people in Congress to stand

2587
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,592
Someone who

2588
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,640
I think 2,000

2589
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,408
Listen to I have a

2590
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:29,600
Who said America can dry up and Blow Away With the Wind

2591
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,136
When we have finished with it

2592
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
America

2593
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,464
Can dry up and blow away with the

2594
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:36,000
When we have finished with

2595
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:38,304
Now that's not the quote

2596
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,680
What's the source of that because I

2597
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,728
TV quotes about myself

2598
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,800
What's the source of that

2599
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:53,920
We got it on the internet here I have a sister

2600
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,968
BMX gear

2601
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,016
It says Netanyahu

2602
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:00,576
For president of America

2603
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:05,184
Veterans today website

2604
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,024
I mean not yeah that's

2605
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,560
Consider the source

2606
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,864
Real quick

2607
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,192
Clip isn't on but just for fun

2608
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:18,496
Does the spoiler alert for the endgame documentary

2609
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:20,032
Alex Jones highlights

2610
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,824
At least four quotes

2611
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:25,408
That are fake that are straight up

2612
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:28,224
Quite a few look at the bibliography he has no siding

2613
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:29,504
Because they weren't

2614
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,832
Force

2615
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:36,416
Where's that Netanyahu coming from

2616
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,464
Ridiculous

2617
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,232
You

2618
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:40,256
He is all over the

2619
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:41,280
But

2620
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,304
We have not yet got

2621
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:43,840
Very weird admission

2622
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,912
What's their Source Abbott

2623
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,496
Their source

2624
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,776
Do you have their Source on

2625
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,568
I'm not sure I don't have it in here

2626
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,176
Oh okay I see story is that it wasn't

2627
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:58,944
CIA

2628
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,736
Overheard

2629
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:03,296
Conversation

2630
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
Criticizes

2631
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:07,904
Not know that

2632
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:16,608
Besides

2633
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,680
Basically approach

2634
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,336
But but other than that

2635
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,920
That is relevant

2636
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:30,688
What

2637
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,456
Happening

2638
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:34,016
Why did you say other than that

2639
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:41,440
Sure I was threatened by an Israeli intelligence officer a famous agent of Mossad came to my

2640
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:47,072
My office and got slightly threatening I don't have any other connection to Israel other than that

2641
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:49,632
Did you report that to the FBI

2642
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:52,960
Like now we have two instances

2643
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,496
Russian

2644
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:59,104
Donaire

2645
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:04,224
Yeah no

2646
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:09,088
What is Israeli intelligence doing going to the second

2647
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:11,392
I didn't I didn't hear that

2648
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
I believe him

2649
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,184
I believe

2650
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,232
Wait or was that

2651
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:20,864
Netanyahu supposedly said he put a time frame on Wednesday massage

2652
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,144
I believe

2653
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,960
I believe that is

2654
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:27,008
Incredibly in line with Alex Jones

2655
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,032
Throwing something out

2656
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:34,432
So there are three guys in the hot tub

2657
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:40,832
Israeli beautiful two-story six different ways for a week

2658
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:44,160
Certainly the way he does

2659
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:50,560
Describe the interaction on RT that he thought was an interview I believe that and I believe what you saying here

2660
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,632
That's true I've listened to him

2661
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:56,960
Everyday for over a year now I think I can

2662
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,496
I can get a sense of when

2663
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,032
It looks like he's

2664
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:03,104
It's almost like I have an EKG on him

2665
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,664
Seeing his face when he's

2666
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,688
Spring for something and when

2667
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
Savage

2668
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:15,904
It's kind of interesting that you have never been interviewed by any of these people because you're literally at this point the world

2669
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,440
Foremost Alex Jones X

2670
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,976
It's also interesting to no one

2671
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,256
Responds to

2672
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:23,584
What I sent them to

2673
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,168
Various Publications probably committing a crime here

2674
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,216
But already

2675
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,496
Give me a meme

2676
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:33,312
We need to make sure we need to make a meme out of

2677
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:37,920
I'd like people to

2678
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,016
Israeli intelligence

2679
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
I feel like

2680
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,856
Just I don't know what it is at the

2681
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
The Hatch Act

2682
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,184
What is what was the actor you got a report that

2683
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:53,024
No idea

2684
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,328
You have to tell somebody about that probably

2685
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:59,424
I'll be in touch with spies that you

2686
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:04,032
Very weird episode where Alex

2687
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,312
Is that all over the place

2688
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,336
Israel

2689
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,152
I don't know if we figured out exactly where he landed on

2690
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,528
He figured out exactly where he landed on the wrong side of stuff

2691
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
I know that

2692
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
But I don't

2693
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:18,368
I don't know debula sway

2694
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,904
Yeah it is sort of holistic

2695
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:27,584
Where you can pin him down you know he's wrong why are you even talking

2696
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:33,984
Why are you getting into gorgeous

2697
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,008
Think about Israel

2698
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:36,288
He fell down real

2699
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,080
Conversation

2700
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,872
And you say

2701
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:44,224
You have lost you have

2702
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,552
You are not going to you're not going to come out of this unscathed

2703
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:52,160
By which I mean European Jew

2704
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:57,792
And then got ruined by all of these African people

2705
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:04,192
God so much for contributing to the show and making up go through the

2706
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:08,032
Happy birthday

2707
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,824
That's what Alex forgot to say

2708
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:16,480
Yes your birthday will be coming up happy birthday on March 3rd got to Montague

2709
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
Don't

2710
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,064
If there's one thing that we've learned about Israel

2711
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:21,856
Don't

2712
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,392
Don't drop just out

2713
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:29,792
I'd like to find out more about the show the website knowledge pike.com

2714
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,816
That knowledge

2715
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:33,632
Underscore fight

2716
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:36,192
Andigo to iTunes

2717
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:39,776
Bro you were still listening your interested in the show

2718
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:44,128
So we've weeded out all the people who are Johnny come lately

2719
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:47,712
Do the plugs if you're still listening I have a special edition

2720
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:51,552
This is The Avengers

2721
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,856
Position

2722
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:56,160
Where I believe that we are not going to

2723
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,696
To make forward progress

2724
02:07:57,952 --> 02:07:58,464
In the projects

2725
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,488
We are engaged

2726
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,024
Without

2727
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:01,792
Expansion

2728
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,120
It's very difficult to expand without resources

2729
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,728
But what we can do is

2730
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,008
Encourage our listeners

2731
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
To post about us

2732
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,312
On bus

2733

Try to get the word out cuz we need

2751
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:50,688
I love those words that we have and it's great that people are listening

2752
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,480
We got to find a way to

2753
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
Widen list

2754
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,528

At this weekend

2758
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:11,424
Sold buttons and telling people about the podcast Google did like a five-minute sing on stage

2759
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:15,520
Are you going to leave it into an old joke

2760
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,056
Was terrible it was

2761
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,592

At standard Road Stow

2767
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,208
And what have you but it was

2768
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,768
Soul crushing to stand that emerge

2769
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,608
I did it when I was in

2770
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,960
Tongue out at the booth with him and it was

2771
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:47,264
Not good you got to do it

2772
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:53,664
You got to do it if you want to make that road money oh yeah please if you like the show how much better

2773
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,712
Would it be if there were ten times as many of us

2774
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:02,880
Appreciate it

2775
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:09,536
Crazy together marriages that have happened because they like my

2779
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,944
Also listen

2780
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,224
Listen if

2781
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,272
You need a gift for this valve

2782
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,320

2783
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:34,368
