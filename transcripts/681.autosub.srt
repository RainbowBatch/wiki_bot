MoneyGram

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552

The altar of Selena

10
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352

00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
DeAndre Jordan

00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
Sure

15
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
It's the dreamy creamy summer

16
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
But I was going to have a special

17
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
And so this week

18
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Astronaut ice cream

19
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,560
I would be exploring the world

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
I have some mixed results there

21
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
There a lot of mixed results outside

00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Between

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224

27
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024

00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
Will give to some of the specifics or at the week but whatever

30
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
But I wanted to bring this up as my bright spot

31
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
About a picture I'm going to send you

00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616

All right it is very dumb

34
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,416
My right spot then is there's there's only they can be only one answer

35
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Miss Morrell and the big steppers dropped and I can tell you right now

36
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
Culmination of

37
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
The past hundred years of music

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,568
It is incredible there is no hyperbole that you can make about this album

39
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
Delia logical endpoint of the moments

40
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,600
First album

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624

Yakima weather

54
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
Tag myself as an over 40 year old

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,559
No it like you know the world so dark right now that the

56
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Crypto

57
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
Financial collapse

58
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
What's your bright spots to see all the

59
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
I know

60
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
Some good memes have come out of it for sure

61
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
So far as the wider world there's not a lot of things are looking really really talk right now

62
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
My little corner of it's looking okay

63
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
I've had

64
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
A nice little vacation

65
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Cuz it's some of your

66
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Your listeners know I'm

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Ben supposed to be in trial

68
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Against

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
We were supposed to be on it

70
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
Stanza

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
Took my kid down the Guadalupe River

72
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
You didn't just drop him off at the Guadalupe River

73
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,439
Just loading the LBG LBJ Library call it good

74
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
It's been a it's been a good couple weeks but we're out of

75
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Just kind of sitting here twiddling our thumbs

76
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
As as soon as this bankrupt

77
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
You know I assume everybody knows we're talking about the here but like right on that

78
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,151
Right on the eve of the trial were supposed to have the first trial that jokes

79
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Engineers a strange little stunts

80
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Pepsi start

81
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
That did not involve himself or the company by which he operates

82
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Is business under

83
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
It involves some little paper in

84
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
10 years ago

85
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,703
Stop the trial because basically when you file bankruptcy in automatic federal court

86
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Witnesses.

87
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,895
And so we had all day they let us right up to that thinking we were going to go to trial

88
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Few days beforehand

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,391
Yeah it sucks for me so right before that was

90
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,047
It has to be like the way it was so immediately I mean like me and Jordan had like

91
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Tickets I lost money on this you're fine

92
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,591
Surfline

93
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Summer

94
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Maika'i

95
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
We had a

96
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
On March 10th

97
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,647
And then it was to adjust a whole bunch

98
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,719
Henninger new attorney number 11 at the time

99
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
The courthouse on break

100
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
We got some of our sleep

101
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
That doesn't seem cool

102
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
Tell me what

103
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,295
Scooby-Doo

104
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,927
Like a ghost suddenly appears outside the courthouse in my we gotta shut this down for 2 weeks

105
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Under and Alex Jones mask

106
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
DAV

107
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
So when that happen

108
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
I don't know

109
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Bankruptcy lawyer

110
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Makes my eyes glaze over

111
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
But of course

112
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
When you're representing who I represent in your suing who I'm suing

113
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
The most powerful lawyers in the world

114
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Cheapest just to do it

115
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,279
Sitting on the sidelines

116
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Bankruptcy

117
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
And it's because we have

118
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,311
So basically a l

119
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
We got him we got

120
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
Lynnwood

121
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Lin-manuel Miranda

122
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Destiny's Child

123
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,471
No like we went seriously that when when when you have a friend like you comes to you and then just like

124
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Take care of don't worry about it

125
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
For me it was I had

126
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Schedule

127
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
You know what these guys cause all sorts of inconvenience for everybody else

128
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
After all the witnesses who were going to come for the court it was setting things up

129
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
But as far as truby they taste

130
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Vacation

131
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
I think it's probably like

132
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,567
Always been a feeling to like

133
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
This isn't going to

134
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Get rid of

135
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Trouble

136
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
You know it's always been

137
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
I mean

138
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
From the moment to start

139
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
Everybody knew it was the question was

140
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,999
With the proposals are putting up be enough to make these cases go away in your ass

141
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
From the started

142
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Explain

143
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,823
Are they watching us right now to set up

144
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
I just want to make sure

145
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
Nobody's looking

146
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
When your sisters may be familiar with

147
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
With bankruptcy

148
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Purdue

149
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Pharmaceuticals went down with the opp

150
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
Bankrupt

151
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,935
Euros personal bankruptcy as a personal consumer when CarMax

152
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
Chasing you down for that

153
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Is very very

154
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Experience

155
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
And you killed 100 million people

156
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
What we call subchapter

157
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
Bankruptcy is by taking entities which were

158
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Doing nominal amount

159
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
What's a business basically

160
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
The plants

161
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
This is the money you have

162
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
Nobody's going to look really closely

163
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Because you have third parties who are

164
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Funding the bankruptcy

165
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Like this is this is what you got understand

166
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
When Purdue goes into bankruptcy

167
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Third-party sources

168
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Could have been sued

169
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
Purdue the money to settle the bankruptcy under the table

170
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
How much money is there

171
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
When Jones and his attorneys, so how went that way

172
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
And what they didn't realize they had none of the necessary ingredients to make it

173
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
Came in there was just a sham you just can't write

174
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Infowars

175
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
On a piece of paper

176
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
Hand it over and say all right that's the company now everything's going to be do that like that doesn't work

177
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
My main problem is that you can do that

178
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
A few weeks off from

179
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
I know this is all

180
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,791
There's no question about that

181
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
And the first thing that happen

182
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
None of these people are doing any business none of them have any assets what are we even doing here

183
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
We're all heading towards the dismissal

184
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Make a bunch of witnesses

185
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
But most people understand

186
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Unravel

187
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
The silliness that they put on

188
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
And your rights a game sometime

189
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Nonsuit

190
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Dismiss our claims against

191
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,663
Bankruptcy

192
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,647
Even though the the attorneys for the entity's and the trustee for the entity's

193
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Are happy there like

194
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
Screaming about how he's been denied the right

195
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
Craig is now all of a sudden

196
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
I'm very strange position

197
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
He took these paper entities

198
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Separated from self

199
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
And in the moment that it had a separate

200
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Did all of a sudden

201
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Ready feels like

202
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
He was going after

203
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
About Reno on Showbox

204
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
Right now is what we're going to talk about

205
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Complaining about that

206
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
I'll Durbin

207
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
On Friday the news came out that the bankruptcy

208
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Issue was sort of boots

209
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
And things will be moving forward

210
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
You know the reason why I reset

211
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Onyx since I certainly don't speak

212
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
Got the language of the Court

213
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
How about we talk about Alex's show from May 8th

214
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Cuz there's a

215
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
You wanted to go over

216
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
I wanna

217
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
Emailing me asking me what the hell is going on

218
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
Invite yourself on our show out of spite

219
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
To our listeners

220
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
Egypt some of the lovely correspondence are the sweetest people in the whole planet

221
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
I'm actually talking about

222
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Mainstream media

223
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,567
This will be your statement to Brian stelter

224
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
Like bankruptcy

225
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Sponge

226
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
I can talk about it

227
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
What's a better selection

228
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
So we can get everybody up to speed

229
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Nice very technical and

230
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Bazaar in

231
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Bubba pain in the ass

232
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,847
If we titled things other than like just the name of

233
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
The date then I would consider it but

234
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Coliseum

235
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,319
You cannot find the episode you are looking

236
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
We don't we don't want to draw people in

237
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Aesthetic

238
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Wrinkles

239
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
I just stupid

240
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
Yeah but we start here

241
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
The bankruptcy

242
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
It's informative showing

243
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Point

244
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Really I'm not good at it

245
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Something up

246
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
And building it up

247
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Information 2 weeks ago

248
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,639
That I mentioned on air and the days later was even the Associated Press

249
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
And then we got more information Friday

250
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
And now we've gotten part of the documents

251
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
We're getting more

252
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
But

253
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
You talk about racketeering

254
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
You talk about a league

255
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
What they're trying to do with info

256
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Record

257
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Is unbelievable

258
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
It's all poison.

259
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
So he's got some

260
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Is what I hear

261
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,223
From him I heard that but would I'm focused on his did he say he's bad

262
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Things up

263
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Well

264
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
I have a mixed feeling about that I was thinking the same thing because that is true and also not truth

265
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
He does it a lot

266
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
But he's good at getting himself

267
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
How to do it

268
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Nicholas Adams

269
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Execution

270
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Soros

271
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Is behind

272
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Is bankruptcy

273
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
There's some shady dealings

274
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
Walmart

275
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,975
This is just great

276
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Start

277
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
I can hear you not answering the

278
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
Do you hear from me right now

279
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Redding Dock of

280
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,223
Is whenever I hear anybody now on Infowars talk about we have documents

281
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
Taking the deposition of the corporate representative Daria car

282
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
And those documents with the most hysterical

283
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
I came with my case today inside

284
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Here's a Wikipedia printout

285
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,031
Wolfgang halbig

286
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
I don't know what the hell.

287
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
I know two things

288
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
One it's going to be really dumb

289
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
I've actually worked out what the document they're talkin

290
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,023
With me cuz this is all hitting me idea

291
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
The document Alex is talking about is

292
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Is Jeff

293
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
The u.s. trustee

294
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
To the courthouse

295
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
I think

296
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
It's it's that

297
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
The government was like hey come on man

298
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Come on

299
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Alexis Wright

300
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
He doesn't understand how Civic

301
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Specific thing

302
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,647
Is what we're dealing with right now is why I think George Soros

303
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Rusty

304
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
You made a recommendation from the court about

305
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
Thumbs up thumbs down on this bankruptcy

306
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Job to do

307
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
I can think of in terms of like what is a document

308
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,223
Autosource is behind all this week

309
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,831
It has been kind of generic and it's been kind of

310
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
It's been thrown more

311
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
Really recently than us

312
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
The courts

313
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
I'm laughing to myself and I'm thinking

314
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Well actually

315
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
That's pretty good

316
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,079
If people in my dream

317
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
But I'm the other mind

318
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
Is I keep seeing him say this s*** about our judge

319
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,807
Like really antagonistic hostile should about our judge

320
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
You know

321
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
Tubidy

322
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
She got to go in

323
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
Walk into the courthouse every day when arriving this trial

324
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
Yeah like I don't think she also has the power to stop

325
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
Miami I'm a lawyer who is currently

326
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,223
Suing somebody and trying to get them held legally responsible for the things they said

327
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Like your speech

328
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
If you were talking about that judge to do something

329
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,559
The moment you say oh well now he's crossed into Crazy Town

330
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,215
I don't think the responsibility falls on this judgment

331
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Counsel representing Alex Jones

332
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,687
People understand

333
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
Picked up by a new guidance of former US attorney

334
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599

336
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647

337
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
An Eric Holder

338
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
But now he's running the show for Alex Intex

339
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Think I need to get a leash on this damn flying

340
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
If he wants to come and make a big reputation of himself

341
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Representing some

342
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Proto-fascist

343
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,848
The least you could do is try

344
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
Rain in the conspiracy theories about what's going on with our judge

345
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
For fucksake

346
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Get your house in order

347
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
That would be nice

348
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
Yeah and it's not like they're be wavy

349
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
He could really affect

350
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
Actively like have a gag order about the case

351
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Without it like

352
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072

00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Did George Soros

384
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Publicly

385
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Arrogance

386
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,152
The Bravada

387
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
I would say

388
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
To say to

389
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
The people

390
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
If you

391
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Stop this

392
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Mistrial

393
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
George Soros

394
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Personally will sue you

395
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
What would it look like

396
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Is that

397
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
People have

398
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Before years

399
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Amazon

400
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
Certainly

401
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,104
I make some aggressive decision

402
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
It always pays off

403
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
And people were second-guessing

404
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,296
When I decided to send a letter to the United States Bankruptcy

405
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
George soros's controlling all

406
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,048
Bankruptcy Court

407
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Is controlling all of this in a few fuckaround you cannot

408
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
That was

409
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
That was a very aggressive

410
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
So I just I just want to

411
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Pat myself on the back a little bit

412
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,992
I mean like like look I don't mean to be dismissive she's about to put this manager this literally I think at this point

413
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Believing

414
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Not believing but winning is audience to believe

415
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Between the United States

416
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Justice my office

417
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
People I know George Soros

418
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
United States bankruptcy judge

419
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
To make him not have a bankruptcy

420
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,728
When it's actually the attorneys for his own company who aren't fight ye bankruptcy

421
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
That is actually exactly what

422
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,992
He does believe that there is a level of coordination that is almost comical

423
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
Between you and

424
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
Update on this Thursday

425
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
2300.

426
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
So,

427
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Half of that

428
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
Especially considering there's a number of states where the DEA

429
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Thesaurus would have to be like able to

430
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Control State commissions and governors and

431
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
You know the problem

432
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
With this is that

433
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
This the most

434
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:29,856
Unreasonable thing about this is that somebody would be such a good administrator that they would be capable of

435
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:36,256
I mean I would almost want somebody who had

436
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
To be empowered

437
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Shredded fight

438
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,896
I would guess that this is some sort of calculation based on

439
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
The number of DEA

440
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Candidates

441
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Who received some sort of donation from some group that in some way has money from Soros Regenerist

442
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Something like that

443
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
What's your hubby some

444
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
Usually bulshit

445
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
You two like some blog like a

446
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Breitbart

447
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,800
Progress for America or America

448
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Here's a list of DEA

449
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,920
And somebody Infowars will see that and then the story will become

450
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,552
George Soros runs nice headline

451
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,928
Something exactly like that and cuz cuz a Alex told me to write this headlines

452
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,256
But in this case what's weird about these comments that he's making

453
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
Is it seems like he's seen something

454
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Descensum

455
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
This is very boring there's nothing

456
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Ripping his ass off

457
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Take me to Subway

458
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
Personally involved

459
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
In the story that Alex

460
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
Because I just want to know what document

461
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
What document made him

462
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Loses

463
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Maybe

464
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
His maybe the kind of thing that ends up driving you crazy because I would that dollars

465
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
Is the donuts there is no.

466
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,480
I would bet you documents to Donuts

467
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,784
You remind me a lot of

468
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,184
Dan in the early days

469
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
And this argument used to get so excited

470
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
YouTube

471
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,912
And over the years he's realized it literally every time it's going to be a run

472
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Football away and down you go

473
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Interesting

474
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Misrepresentation

475
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,416
I think it's just that Jose Garza is the Travis County

476
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,768
And see when he was running in the election cycle did get some donations

477
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
Pictures of

478
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Yeah

479
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,360
Is that the extremely routine action

480
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
United States trustee for a banker

481
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
Filing a recommendation with

482
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Stuff that extremely routine action

483
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Absolutely

484
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Come on

485
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
You're saying it's

486
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
It's totally routine

487
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,328
I actually have some information here that might

488
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Put this in a different time

489
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,680
Okay

490
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
It makes me proud of who I am

491
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
It makes me really really

492
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Proud

493
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
I'm all of you show

494
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
The lawyers rated green light

495
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
But I already told you

496
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Part 1

497
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,552
Lawyers that don't get into much detail just

498
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Midshipman

499
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Called up

500
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
The federal court in the trustees

501
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
And said

502
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Department and the president

503
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
As policy

504
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,824
This is basically order it is the policy of the US government

505
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Executive

506
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
Don't sound so routine now does it

507
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Biden called UPS or assault Mary Garland

508
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,328
And we got to get this s*** done okay

509
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
Because only the executive can do this alright

510
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
It started when all the way up the flagpole it literally goes all the way to the top

511
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
America

512
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
So I don't know

513
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
Lake let me break it down to simple as possible with what the

514
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
United States

515
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
For this weekend

516
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,440
So you can understand what he did

517
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Infowars LLC

518
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
In any other

519
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Petition for a small business Banker

520
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
Hey we want to use a bankruptcy

521
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,008
Seaford businesses that conduct a little business but not a ton

522
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
What's the best way to scout

523
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
And then after they did it

524
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
United States

525
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
It's called schedules schedules

526
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
What

527
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
Business they do what their revenue is what they actually have

528
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Schedule

529
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
We ain't got squat we don't have anything

530
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
0

531
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Nothing

532
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
We don't do business

533
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
United States trustee files Rico

534
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,864
I'm not sure that this just bankruptcies appropriate for subchapter 5

535
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,472
Cuz they said they didn't do any business so we're not sure there's a broke

536
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Accommodating tone

537
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
The answer is

538
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,944
But I do appreciate its Mark leaving out the

539
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Gets involved

540
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
That's the thing here is that

541
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
Is revealing to me to do

542
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,816
I hear what you're saying when y'all think that Jones stinks in his mind

543
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
I still

544
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,960
Tuesday believe that Jones just thinks that anytime he can take something and twisted

545
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
Jamaica Teresa persecuted

546
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Victim of some sort of

547
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
And I think

548
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
He knows damn well

549
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
A store

550
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Where they try to do a double backflip

551
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Flip and landed on there

552
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
I think that he knows

553
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
And it's in a sick it's so sick to me to that

554
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
He is absolutely private up that on

555
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,592
Start this crap

556
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
This bankruptcy Hail Mary and I

557
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
No now I'm being screwed out of my home bankruptcy is like there's always another hat

558
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
So annoying

559
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Remarkable

560
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,960
I even if he does say he needs to get a green light from his lawyer so I definitely would have encouraged that to happen

561
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,200
Billion dollars to pay that bounty on a judge that I called for last time

562
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,856
I got the green light for my lawyers I don't think he was on Christmas or not $5 judge

563
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
So I mean like here's the thing though it's Jones's is on notice he knows that the FBI had to get involved because there were people making

564
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Threats against the judge

565
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
Connecticut on his website

566
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
He's known about Downhere Intex

567
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Texas

568
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Making threats online

569
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
We've had conversations

570
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,896
Absolutely nose

571
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
Look up of course

572
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
A hundred percent

573
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
These kind of things

574
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,624
The more I just cannot stand the kind of attorneys

575
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
I think that you have fun

576
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
You have to look at this from a different perspective

577
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
I am that is what Alex has a job create

578
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,448
A lot of these FBI agents were having to provide security for the

579
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,520
You know.

580
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Do you want them out on the street

581
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
Protecting like the house

582
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Houseless snow

583
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
Of course not you want them meaning rich and Powerful

584
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Is it is the truth it isn't because

585
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Because

586
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
When your Texas State judge

587
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
You look you've got the bailiffs in that bill

588
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
That's you protect

589
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
If you got

590
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,448
Credible actionable intelligence against

591
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
To investigate

592
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Exactly

593
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
There's just nobody coming

594
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Protect you

595
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
Particular Courthouse

596
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Right leg in this is they all know that

597
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
This is all been discussed

598
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
50

599
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
To say that I am like

600
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
You know involved in some sort of

601
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
Bohemian Grove conspiracy

602
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
I don't just keep

603
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Whatever

604
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
But the fact that he keeps directly Northeast

605
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Is that a US bankruptcy

606
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
F*** you

607
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
That's just insane

608
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
If you want to look at the

609
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
The points of this conspiracy we got Soros

610
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
We got B

611
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
We got married Garland in the entire doj

612
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,512
We got the bankruptcy judge we have the u.s. trustee we have marked we have the lawyer

613
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Pretty much

614
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
I mean what's great about

615
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
What was great about it once again

616
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
We're not mentioned just left out of it

617
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,224
Oh well I hope so

618
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
Trustee letter

619
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
This is this

620
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
That's

621
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
But mostly the documents

622
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
But he's talking about

623
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Future

624
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
And build it up

625
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
International news

626
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
The document

627
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
The Mummy

628
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Put together powerful articles

629
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
So soon

630
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
But if you want to see

631
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Department

632
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Getting involved in a mi EX

633
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
The federal courts

634
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Yeah

635
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
Show trials in

636
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,592
Bostitch anymore so I say okay will do an emergency we're going to station

637
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
That's not what you did

638
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
They are

639
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Crosshair

640
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
I hear you fear

641
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
That's what I get from you

642
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,536
Bankruptcy in the air

643
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
The reorganization of his business

644
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
I mean conclusion here though is that he should be able to reach the

645
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
Other conclusion of that as well which is when you asked

646
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
What's the question

647
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,616
Have you ever seen the justice department intervene in a bankruptcy trial

648
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
The answer is

649
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
That's how much of an a****** you are

650
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,064
I don't I don't know the answer is no

651
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
The Department of Justice

652
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
Bankruptcy Court

653
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
To act as a

654
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
A neutral

655
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,656
Third-party Observer

656
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
And so

657
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
You argue the government

658
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Physician

659
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,248
Argue what the government

660
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Position is as if he was representing

661
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
I mean he's almost like a

662
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:54,816
We have a lot of expertise

663
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Javar

664
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
Neutral

665
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
It is it

666
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
There's no doubt that

667
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,568
The position of the u.s. trustee token this case was aggressive

668
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
For the US trustee's normal

669
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Opposition

670
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
Tell much of an ass-whole he is

671
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
You're right because this Bank

672
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,808
Cookie was a sham from the start but look the problem is that everybody

673
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,672
The realities is why say bankruptcy is stupid is everybody

674
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Everybody knew

675
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
The bankruptcy was stupid

676
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
That's not what it was actually

677
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
Frowned upon in the bankruptcy world

678
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
What does

679
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
Was a stop of all the trials

680
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,824
And if it hadn't been done on the absolute evil trial might not have been that dirty

681
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
But didn't it stop all the trial

682
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
And then basically have a settlement offer

683
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,760
Everybody has to stop take a breath

684
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
Look at it and see if you're going to accept it

685
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
For a couple weeks

686
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
What the problem here is that they did that and then there

687
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Planned funding agreements

688
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,448
Was absolutely ridiculous they basically wanted every one of these all of the cases

689
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Couple hundred thousand dollars

690
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,336
An end to do that on the bond the assurance that Jones would

691
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,640
In the future continue to contribute

692
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Funds to a

693
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Bankruptcy settlement over the year

694
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Which means basically like

695
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,064
You've got to let go

696
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Invite him make money so we can give it

697
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Look here

698
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Reno

699
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
We know for a fact

700
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Fact

701
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,632
But there is 25 million dollars that Jones has sitting in a Family Trust

702
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
P2P Ark

703
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Free Speech adios

704
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
$11,000 a month

705
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
There is

706
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,016
Doesn't want to expose it to a federal bankruptcy

707
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
And what did you make that offer

708
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
Everybody

709
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,488
The hell knows what comes next

710
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
Absolutely

711
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,448
With some sort of Nefarious play in the bankruptcy court

712
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
I guess we're done that's it

713
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
And I'm Joe spinning this like it's saying

714
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
Being a part of this whole coordinated

715
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Apocalypse

716
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Stone thing

717
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Think about

718
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Apocalypto

719
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Check on some days

720
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:31,744
Apocalypse

721
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
Billion dollars

722
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,192
Randomly from a mysterious Anonymous donor

723
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Yeah that was me

724
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
I transfer that money I just felt like we both scared

725
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,992
I just left

726
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:59,648
Again biscuit

727
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,792
Again this is a bold move they don't teach at Law School

728
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Emily have a crush

729
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
Beat up front

730
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
I actually called George Soros and asked him to make

731
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
You said yes sir

732
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,968
In that clip their the

733
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
He said like

734
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
The doj opposes the bankruptcy that's what I was talking about earlier

735
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
That is an article about

736
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Trustee letter

737
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,096
Reggie talks about this bankruptcy stuff

738
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
Just got to be powerful articles

739
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
If you can't get it

740
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,855
I've always ever since you had that episode and suddenly it hit me like a lightning bolt while listening to your thing on that

741
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
No you can't

742
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
The shooting by that

743
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:09,023
What you're talking about following up on the story

744
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,583
Why the hell are you talking about

745
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
2017

746
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
But the idea

747
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
Right now there is somebody

748
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
Tapout a story

749
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
About what this big

750
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
I hope they come

751
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,063
I don't know what I mean like

752
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
People are so

753
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
I hate to say this to you

754
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
So many sour grapes

755
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,191
Over the course of this podcast I can't imagine this man satisfy

756
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
We do wish you the best

757
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
Stanza

758
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Come on

759
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
I know they're going to do

760
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
So we're going to jump off the lawsuit

761
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Situation

762
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
Happy Mother's Day

763
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,415
Newtonian physics teaches us

764
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
There is

765
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Unequal

766
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Is that what you

767
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
There is good

768
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Amazing crew

769
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Tonight

770
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
On Mother's Day

771
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Defense

772
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Yeah

773
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
I would love that music

774
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
Behind

775
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,511
I would just love to be like

776
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,911
Sohcahtoa tells us what the sign of a triangle is equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse

777
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,519
Comedian says if you get in a bath

778
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,335
Yeah just my science lessons

779
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
It's up over a hot beat

780
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
He's like I know you'll cry heard that Alex Jones folk music

781
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,111
Remix and all that where he's doing the folk song I have

782
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
Complex feelings about that

783
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
I'm telling you right now

784
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,119
Listening listening to Alex Jones over death punk is creepiest

785
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
Daft Punk Tron soundtrack

786
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
I don't know everything about

787
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
I appreciate you can

788
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
Pick out what that is

789
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
Because I can remember most of his music is I just don't have as good of a

790
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
St.Louis

791
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
Multiple songs from the Tron

792
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
Track that he uses bumper

793
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Music so that's fun

794
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Soundtrack

795
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Astonishing

796
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Best way to take a detour for a second to say

797
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,079
That's a f****** music score

798
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,223
Play the entire soundtrack

799
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Excellent

800
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Focus

801
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Mind music

802
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,791
You will never listen

803
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
Plutonium

804
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
It's weird

805
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
You can actually chart

806
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Departure of

807
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
And when he was

808
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Fully in control is

809
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
Old country

810
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
Amarillo by Morning

811
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,303
Oh yeah we used to listen to The Highwaymen Silver Stallion

812
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
Harrison Smith on the American Journal

813
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
He plays some wild

814
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
Music

815
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
The Valkyries

816
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Bizarre

817
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Mexico

818
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,271
Alex gets into talking about that

819
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Rally's

820
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,695
Which window

821
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
Supreme Court

822
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Opinion has been

823
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
45 years ago

824
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
George will use your big toe

825
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Pro-life Catholic

826
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Activist

827
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,519
He said why don't you just not criticize abortion on air

828
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,847
Why don't you come out and see if yourself so I want to play

829
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
People walk up

830
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Wow

831
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Milwaukee

832
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
Even blackbear

833
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Nobody wants these black

834
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
You going to take some

835
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
They were at

836
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
Thousand

837
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
The time

838
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,503
Leo and was out at a rally

839
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,807
Pro-choice rally

840
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Hundreds of instances

841
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Of people

842
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Being demons

843
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,951
And hissing about how no one wants

844
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,535
That's wack baby and carrying books by Harriet Beecher Stowe around

845
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Apparently

846
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Jesus Christ

847
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,679
I feel like if this stuff was really

848
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Accurate in any way

849
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Which I don't think it is

850
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,287
Be clear about that

851
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
If it was

852
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,127
Alex would not have the exact same examples

853
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
420 f***

854
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,223
Commuter cars

855
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
There will be new stories that aren't exactly the same

856
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Eczema

857
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,815
The problem with true

858
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
I wouldn't be surprised

859
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
From time to time

860
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
That some

861
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Either either

862
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Person

863
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,359
Spending time Parenthood from counter-protesters

864
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,919
Wilshire I like throwing up

865
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,391
Is like so I don't know the

866
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
The pathology of like

867
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Interior fantasy

868
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
Interesting place it is

869
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Interesting place

870
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Yeah

871
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:47,615
It's really hard to tell how much of it is sincere and it is like his

872
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
Perceptual distortions

873
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,223
I'd like the things that he's taking in the stimulus

874
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
And how much of it is kind of just like

875
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
Storytelling

876
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
And like lying

877
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
Like he usually does

878
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
Tiffany about Jones recently so like you up

879
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:17,055
Holy Angels music

880
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,383
Attracted

881
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:27,039
The grid I feel like I've always struggled with this idea of first it was this Jones believe what he say does he not believe what he say

882
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Does he ever

883
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,903
It's the package of this is Jones

884
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
The basic

885
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
Approximation

886
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,511
If you if you contain in whatever you're talking about

887
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,839
25% of the truth

888
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
You're free to run.

889
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
25

890
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
England

891
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,127
That you can anchor all the bulshit onto you can fly that kite

892
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,015
Who's that 25% of f******

893
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
R-Truth

894
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
You are toast

895
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
That is said

896
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,207
And unfortunately that's why

897
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Forcibly stop

898
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
That if you go

899
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Zach's bar in the b*******

900
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
That easily toppled his house of cards

901
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,751
You're going to get into trouble but if you always have the bar buddies body

902
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Body

903
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
If you think he learned anything

904
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
You're going to be disappointed

905
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,431
I think that I might agree with Jordan

906
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
Conceptually

907
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,111
That like you have to have some anchor to reality

908
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Just run wild

909
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
But what I would disagree with

910
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
25%

911
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
My birthday

912
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,559
Very interested

913
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Is generous

914
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,887
It reminds me of the Kid Daniel's deposition wood

915
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:51,519
With Bill asked him to rate his article on the scale of 1 to 10

916
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:56,895
Really

917
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,039
Estimation of weather and I do think you're right baby. Numbers like at about 5

918
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
Yeah I think so

919
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
You find a news article that has

920
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,935
Just listen as much as we would like

921
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Like to think

922
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
I think I think

923
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,775
Maybe some of the lessons

924
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
Are there

925
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
Probably not divorced

926
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
Right

927
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
B

928
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,991
I think we're listening to would leave me to suggest

929
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,623
Maybe don't say defamatory things about

930
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Non-public

931
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
A fact.

932
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:53,727
I put it at probably an 80% chance that he implies Sandy Hook did not happen

933
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,855
That's the wonderful thing

934
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
You think it's like

935
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:18,047
Strange things in deposition

936
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
Play the trial

937
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,911
When is the defendant themselves that you're not playing that does money

938
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Either he has

939
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:38,015
I block you in what you're testifying now is not what you just testified

940
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
Your your kind of flopped

941
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
He has to argue

942
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,719
That there are still anomaly

943
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Totally

944
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Cooper

945
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
MMA it's just going to fall

946
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,191
Balloons fall from the ceiling

947
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
You're you're still a

948
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
Under this assumption in this world

949
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,919
Alex Jones is going to show up

950
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
Assumption

951
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
Clear open court

952
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
Just afraid for the

953
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,327
Whatever

954
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,863
Talkin about

955
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:30,751
So you're going to like what are you literally talking

956
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Soros's really afraid

957
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,383
The big reasons they pulled

958
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,663
Does bankruptcy start and stop

959
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
None

960
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
And so they're like well do this sub buys leather

961
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Because we have

962
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,911
Mark already

963
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Jordan

964
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
We got Bobby Barnes

965
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
It's coming up in a little bit

966
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,823
About the case

967
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
Albert

968
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
We have to skip

969
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,479
Abortion protest

970
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
And that was kind of sucks his way of talking

971
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,599
Does religiosity show

972
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
Sure and he says this

973
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
And I think

974
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,743
This is actually a bottle of his

975
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,303
The notion that he's

976
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
People who

977
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,143
Have different religious ideas

978
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
You don't want to be turned into these crates

979
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
You don't want

980
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
The connection of the insulin

981
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,759
Because when you God's spirit

982
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
God's open hands

983
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
Except B

984
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,927
Choice

985
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Did.

986
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
And that's not

987
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
A spiritual

988
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
Group you want to be associated with

989
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
You do not

990
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
Want to be with that

991
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
You want to say

992
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,055
Theraflu if you

993
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
You know if you don't

994
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,151
Agreed to join up with that God as Alex

995
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Define zit

996
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
You have

997
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,575
My will to be part of

998
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:27,743
Join up with Alex's specific brand of Christian

999
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:32,095
Then you accept responsibility for every other problem that

1000
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,191
Ever happened

1001
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,751
Being able to live in a pluralistic

1002
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,799
6 different religious

1003
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
Beliefs

1004
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:47,967
Seems like you would be defining every other religion as being of God

1005
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:52,319
Isaiah boskin your city and you

1006
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
Claim that all that goes on in there is

1007
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
Demonic worship

1008
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,207
But that doesn't mean you can't hang out with them

1009
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,375
I think Alex has a short jump

1010
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
That's not good

1011
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,591
Revealing themselves as being out of touch

1012
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
The doors of the infinite just like

1013
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
Call Dollar

1014
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:30,207
Hang up

1015
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Messing around with

1016
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
The infinite in the doors

1017
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Perception

1018
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
You know what

1019
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,399
Yeah you don't know what you're talkin about

1020
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
Prime

1021
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:51,967
Being an utter freaking

1022
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,015
Is it seems to combine a bunch of life

1023
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
New age

1024
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:04,255
High place of the Kingdom of Heaven like he's basically equating

1025
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Joe Rogan doing DMT

1026
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
Weird

1027
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
It's almost

1028
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,311
Like your Christian identities

1029
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,407
Read a bunch of

1030
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,671
He's already

1031
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
He's already been heading that direction

1032
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,047
I don't I don't know how to hook different that would be

1033
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
I honestly I mean

1034
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Yeah exactly

1035
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,727
So we get to update on some media

1036
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,311
I don't know if you are somebody who keeps up with

1037
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,895
Former members of the cast members of Saturday Night Live

1038
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Mike Myers Mike Myers no I don't really keep up with him I'm more of a

1039
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,183
Lego

1040
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
I know he's about to talk about

1041
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,559
And I caught that on Netflix can I watch that the other night

1042
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
The first

1043
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,095
Antenna

1044
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,887
Did a bunch of characters and I'm going to tell you

1045
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
The showing

1046
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,543
Goddamn

1047
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
I'm excited

1048
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,127
To hear your review after this clip

1049
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Also on Netflix

1050
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
I got a bunch of calls about it

1051
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,319
Call deepen Tavern making fun of the Illuminati

1052
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
They tax me quite a bit the movie

1053
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,927
I thought we would just show out that's what these folks are

1054
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:46,143
He plays a clip of Mike Myers playing the character

1055
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
It when he says

1056
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,311
The folks are so desperate he is he talking about Mike Myers in the cast of in the crew and the producers of that show

1057
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,359
Is he talking about

1058
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:04,063
You betcha

1059
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
Absolutely

1060
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,303
Conspiracy

1061
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
It's the wrong Mike Myers

1062
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
If Mike Myers shows up

1063
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,871
Get in my heresy

1064
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,063
I think we did it

1065
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,135
Cuz I haven't

1066
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
This

1067
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,511
I study this kind of stuff

1068
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Even know this

1069
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
Existed

1070
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:53,215
This is the big broadside attack

1071
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,287
It's really easy to make fun of

1072
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:02,687
Yeah

1073
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,599
Sort of like

1074
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
No

1075
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,911
It is a recognition of like how

1076
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,239
Geez that people like

1077
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,079
This as a thing very clearly

1078
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
This stuff though I don't know if you remember during all my deposition he used to just obsessing about

1079
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,831
Really Broad

1080
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,975
Play nobody's f******

1081
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:51,071
Dumbass Rider in California

1082
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
You have a good doctor

1083
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:56,703
Obsessed with that for a little while

1084
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Come on

1085
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,055
He claimed the basis of The X-Files

1086
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Both exile

1087
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
So as promised

1088
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Earlier

1089
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
We have

1090
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
Buddy showing up

1091
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Hit someone I believe Mark you've actually been in a room with

1092
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Baba

1093
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Goodwill furniture sale

1094
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,863
I'm going to be

1095
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,911
Universal

1096
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Stop Crossing

1097
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,263
By Barnes I'll be in the room with him in the future shortly so

1098
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,799
Please get that give him our best

1099
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
But it's it's

1100
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Despite the

1101
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,391
The fact that Jones's corporate representative

1102
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,463
Testified that they're considering suing Barnes from Outback

1103
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
Marker

1104
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,103
But like it don't go tell him that

1105
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,895
That's why you still on the show

1106
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:13,247
What's funny is if you look at the Infowars LLC bankruptcy assets that they claim

1107
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
One of the few

1108
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
Set that they do claim they have

1109
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Is a potential mouth

1110
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
Disclaim

1111
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,671
That ain't we might get money in the future

1112
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,999
This case

1113
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
It looks funny

1114
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,863
Barnes got the hell out and I think he thought he was

1115
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,239
But the interesting part is Tucker Carlson's Daily Caller

1116
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,919
Defamation smear scheme against Pakistani

1117
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
IT workers in the house

1118
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
Frame them

1119
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
This is BS

1120
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
VIP

1121
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:57,023
Is that you do the work for

1122
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,583
Hardcore

1123
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
You don't have no idea

1124
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,191
But if you follow like right wing

1125
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,031
Mediaite

1126
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
You know

1127
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,175
Give me about a while back

1128
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,759
I think he was a little careful on that partially because

1129
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,975
The People's Republic and Ed Salem

1130
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
Reporting by Band-Aid

1131
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,863
We're trying to be a little more of the highbrow high-class info

1132
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Little bit

1133
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
Quite the same Circle

1134
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
Yes very pretentious Infowars

1135
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:45,663
K-Swiss

1136
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,967
The reporter this guy who wrote

1137
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:55,647
Daily Caller

1138
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
For whatever reason

1139
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:03,071
Surprise surprise

1140
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375

Goody was there from publicity you take that away from your job

1147
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
Let me ask you a quick question here by Barnes

1148
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
In person

1149
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Off mic

F****** sentences together without

01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Without ever taking

1158
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,735

But

1162
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,487
Whitney what's interesting about Barnes is he was so we had a moment

1163
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,327

1211
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
2000

1212
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:38,623

1213
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487

Geolocation data

1217
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
To prove that

1218
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,639
2000 people

1219
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,783
Like really obvious

1220
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
In the way that they

1221
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,855
Does putting together and I'll get

1222
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
Obvious

1223
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:18,815
According to Alex

1224
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:24,959
Camera on them trying to stack 2,000 mules on top of radar

1225
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Yeah

1226
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,567
You do that what you get bigger platforms like I don't know the weight

1227
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,847
Would be at 7

1228
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Being fed

1229
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,759
Dinesh D'Souza documentary on the recommended

1230
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Station of Alex Jones's most Schumann

1231
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,671
I can possibly imagine

1232
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
For most of his career

1233
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
I'm pretty sure Alex would have been

1234
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:53,887
Been staunchly opposed to Dinesh D'Souza Whole30 con matter of course

1235
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,959
The mainline conservative

1236
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Strange

1237
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
Understand

1238
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:03,359
Transformation about f****** party man cuz

1239
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,687
I feel like as soon as you get a pardon

1240
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
From Trump gear

1241
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
You're in

1242
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
Are you got to ask

1243
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,047
But at least for now yes

1244
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
The doc

1245
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,375
Kamari self is about sort of manual

1246
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
The manipulation of okay

1247
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,983
Menu Buell gas manipulation

1248
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,639
People going around and actually physically put it balancing

1249
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
As opposed

1250
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,735
Changing the Dominion machine

1251
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,415
From listening to our to the show as much as we have some

1252
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
The election

1253
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,255
Alex was very big into the electronic voting

1254
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
10 conspiracy

1255
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Is all electronic

1256
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:59,935
Was funding for a little while by Michelangelo

1257
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:08,895
We have to have paper ballots in order to maintain the integrity

1258
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,455
The election because of all the election

1259
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,087
The other Dinesh d'souza's documentaries

1260
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,671
Tomorrow's weather

01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207

For those who don't know tell us where it is

1264
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Who made it

1265
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,911
The foxes say we're not going to air it down

1266
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,959
You know totally documented as you said

1267
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,751
Electronic scam

1268
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,567
What's the Deep State red herring

1269
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,151
When you were all over the country for Trump proving it was mules

1270
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,735
Voting multiple times getting carpeting the fake valid

1271
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
Filling a minute in Arena

1272
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Improving

1273
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
You have been totally Vindicated

1274
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:03,167
So Alex you're admitting you got, they got calm

1275
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,567
This is the new thing if you're wrong

1276
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
It's a Honeypot

1277
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,967
You were but it's only cuz the Deep state

1278
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:21,599
To get you it's it's not really your

1279
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Track

1280
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,415
And you're going to miss this

1281
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,767
You going to miss 1,000 X 1,000 X

1282
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Cuz you were racist right like there's

1283
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
It's a red herring

1284
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,055
Misdirection

1285
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,127
This is the exact same thing they did with the birth

1286
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
Certificate

1287
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,479
The Kenya thing was a misdirection

1288
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,015
Did they put out in order

1289
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,575
To get us because they knew that we would be racist

1290
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
Jacob a.

1291
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
Frank Marshall Davis

1292
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:05,119
Essentially proves that they are what they say that their denial blow-dryer

1293
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,679
Could you get

1294
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,239
Their Jones isn't the only person who wiped

1295
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,543
The pizzagate should off his shoe

1296
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,407
GameStop

1297
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:27,135
What we do need actually paper pollocksville I guess

1298
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:32,511
He offers

1299
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
But you also need

1300
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,071
A specific

1301
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,095
Practice

1302
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
To be used

1303
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,447
You need to do a signature

1304
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,239
Because if you did a cig

1305
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Get your match check

1306
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
To this day

1307
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
On these back

1308
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
That's absolutely not true

1309
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,807
Barnes

1310
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:02,463
Almost all of them have some sort of signature matching as a part of their vote verification

1311
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,255
Often done by computer software

1312
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:10,399
Article in the New York Times per cent of all mail-in ballots

1313
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,703
In the 2018 election because of signature

1314
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
Mismatches

1315
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
Barnes is just straight of line

1316
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,591
The states but they scream about the most

1317
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
About being stolen

1318
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,687
20 election like Michigan and Arizona

1319
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,759
Place already

1320
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,135
A non-existent problem I really feel like we've got pieczenik coming down

1321
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,951
The pipeline and it's going to go right back to him and be like

1322
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:39,071
Listen Alex they were Watermark and now we got a double water bike

1323
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
The next one

1324
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
I will say that Rogers

1325
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
Conspiracy about the

1326
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:50,335
Coming into Maine.

1327
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
North Korean boat

1328
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
What's that ended up

1329
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,967
In Maine

1330
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Bugatti

1331
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,719
Boats

1332
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,791
I can't say anything bad about the people

1333
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
They love boating 11

1334
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,935
That's where a lot of the the fake vote

1335
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:27,711
Okay let me get on

1336
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,295
How old is the United States election

1337
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Okay

1338
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,135
What happened was

1339
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
Spider-Man the Democrats

1340
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,231
Realize they didn't have enough vote

1341
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
So they

1342
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,327
North Korean

1343
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
Because there are too many

1344
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,471
Stupid in one playing it would just go right right right

1345
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
So they got on

1346
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
Yeah

1347
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,591
Filled with bags and bags of watermarks

1348
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,663
Directly from

1349
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
North Korea

1350
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,247
To maintain the United States

1351
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
Yeah it's actually I can

1352
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
I see the confusion that's happening here

1353
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,999
Game with people to vote fraudulently

1354
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
It was paper

1355
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:19,679
Paperback

1356
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
What what

1357
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,383
Okay

1358
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Define

1359
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:34,527
Siri is not incompatible

1360
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,415
With the 200m

1361
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:44,511
Yeah we got to get desouza on the boat situation

1362
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
CPU definition

1363
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Do you like

1364
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,727
A sort of like

1365
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,519
I'm just I'm not sure I was ready

1366
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Jesus Christ

1367
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,335
Korean boats

1368
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:04,223
There's a lot of stuff that we have just internalized as part of our fix

1369
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,759
External reality event

1370
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:10,879
People who are

1371
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,535

1372
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:37,759
Beyond

1373
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
Future like real ass boots

1374
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
See this is where it gets a little bit sticky

1375
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,559
Because Rodger can't specify about the size of boat

1376
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,167
But then you think

1377
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,959
Will be much easier to catch if it was a big boy

1378
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
Destroyer

1379
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,479
Paddle boat

1380
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:20,767
Just got a giant amount of fighting

1381
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:25,119
It's in the water as paper do

1382
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
Set the problem

1383
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:34,079
Make any sense yeah you don't want to know where there's two thousand converter

1384
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
Set the alarm telling you right now

1385
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759

Trade it with with

1387
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,807
But tight.

1388
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:50,207
So I think it was just randomly where Rodger decided to

1389
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:55,327
Stephen King has Rodger

1390
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,519
Here is where we get back to your side of the street

1391
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543

01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Blueprint

1513
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,856
Jones has a way that he wants to try to make things right

1514
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
Heroes and

1515
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,232
Acrimony and avoided by the drop

1516
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:36,288
In the moment

1517
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,592
Forasmuch as this process can

1518
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,920
Work the process worked

1519
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
It works these everybody's getting off

1520
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
About

1521
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952
That's not Ed spinning

1522
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,280
That my trust has been called off

1523
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:01,376
Be able to like refute

1524
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,776
I know that a hundred percent.

1525
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
Schmidt is not talk

1526
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:16,736
Appropriate

1527
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,808
Yeah yeah and so what he just said right there is

1528
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,344
I'm not going to

1529
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
There's not

1530
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:29,024
There is not the chance that there is mouthpieces by former judge Smith that's not a thing that happen

1531
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,608
Is an outright lie attic

1532
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
Complete

1533
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:39,008
Complete contradiction of everything that I was arguing earlier that shows 25%

1534
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,944
Well I'm glad we've disabuse you of that notion

1535
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
How much

1536
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,416
Mark would you guess that Soros has spent

1537
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:59,488
On the case that you're the lawyer for

1538
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
That's such a funny

1539
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,840
Any questions

1540
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,056
It's funny because I'm usually involved in litigation that is kind

1541
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,896
Uno

1542
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,432
A good product

1543
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,968
Trial

1544
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,016
The product is going to take a lot of XP

1545
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,040
Testimonial

1546
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,320
It's really expensive

1547
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,416
How much does much is a quarter-million to half-a-million dollars

1548
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,120
Is that in Jones's case it's not quite as much

1549
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,656
Protest

1550
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:42,752
Texas lawyer traveling all over the country

1551
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,312
It's a lot cheaper

1552
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:48,896
I'll be I'll be really upfront cuz I want

1553
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,944
I went to Jones people to know

1554
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,736
I want them to understand this

1555
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
That this case so far soup

1556
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,832
$10,000

1557
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Money

1558
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
Has been paid over

1559
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
More than three times by Jones himself

1560
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
We've already collect

1561
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
He's paid for all of them

1562
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,800
And look

1563
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,480
Like driving itself was a risk of Lost

1564
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:31,136
We're doing

1565
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,536
Well we don't really

1566
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,096
This is not something for the pain

1567
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,120
Every takes

1568
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,680
To get the parents their day and at this point

1569
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,960
That's not a

1570
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
The factory

1571
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,288
Cause I don't need George Soros

1572
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Mark I pray

1573
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
Appreciate your perspective

1574
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,640
And I understand your

1575
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,920
Intimately involved

1576
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,712
With the case that you are

1577
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
Conducting

1578
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
However

1579
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
I have

1580
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
If what you're saying is true

1581
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:08,512
You're making a lot of this Soros money cuz next clip

1582
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
Wilson

1583
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Yeah if

1584
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
You're very rich

1585
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:21,312
Even trying to hide this

1586
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
Why are they

1587
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,760
Why are they so obsessed

1588
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,576
Have an associate come out soon

1589
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,624
I'm over 10 million dollars

1590
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,208
To do that what does he look like

1591
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,768
When all that comes out and it there now

1592
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
Openly trying to

1593
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,328
Threatened

1594
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Bankruptcy

1595
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
The justice department

1596
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,848
Purple

1597
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,872
Purposes

1598
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,408
So ten million dollars

1599
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
Soros

1600
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,552
Pride I think I think you're mistreating I think you're not understanding that Soros

1601
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:08,416
Is spending that money not on me but for other things maybe like he is

1602
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,024
Like like paying for hackers to manufacture an email to

1603
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:19,424
Jones saying your sources are batshit crazy.

1604
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:27,360
He conveyed listen I'm saying that he gave you that money up front and you've been Outsourcing all of your deep State sit for a while

1605
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Packers

1606
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:41,184
What's the New York Times

1607
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,584
That's what surprises me is the megalomania

1608
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:53,472
Thinking that it would take 10 million dollars to destroy you when you have engineered your own destruction

1609
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,568
Like that

1610
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,896
Did you take somebody like look II

1611
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,712
Me and a couple members my forever

1612
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
Decided we'd

1613
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,136
Like to kind of chill out a little bit

1614
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,464
Nice to see it happen

1615
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
It hasn't been like

1616
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Like we didn't need

1617
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
Deep State funding to do it

1618
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,120
Like we just needed a little bit of

1619
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,936
Time to be willing to say

1620
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,592
In the families know this to

1621
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
Very rewarding

1622
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
For them

1623
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,224
Be adequately compensated

1624
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,088
The moment of Reckoning

1625
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:48,000
Yeah to see it through and we're going to see it through and it's not that big of a deal like I don't

1626
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,560
I don't understand why he thinks it has to be like

1627
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,400
Like your house to be like in this this global

1628
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,192
I can explain this

1629
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
Very easily

1630
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,264
He's a narcissist

1631
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
He believes

1632
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Crazy nonsense

1633
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,432
That's really inconvenient for him

1634
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,480
So

1635
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:14,880
Andy has a tenuous if not completely lost grasp on reality

1636
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,744
So

1637
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
Thesaurus

1638
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
So much Crow I'm just going to be so embarrassed you remind me of the Soros antifa

1639
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,496
Contract

1640
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,544
From a 4chan troll post

1641
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,104
I think that might be

1642
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,128
Like

1643
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,432
Disappointing

1644
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,272
So Barnes has some thoughts

1645
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,576
About this case in and of itself

1646
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:47,648
Play Alex

1647
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440
That's what's going on here

1648
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,000
I mean the goal has been just pure intimidation

1649
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,280
The only thing they know

1650
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,304
Just like the intimidation

1651
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
Economy.

1652
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
Chipley weather

1653
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,496
But it's the complete

1654
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,032
Dangerous partisan

1655
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,784
I mean

1656
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
Escalating

1657
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,624
And the problem

1658
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,392
Had confidence

1659
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
In the merits of their cage

1660
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:25,280
Then they wouldn't be using these Shenanigans they would be

1661
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,304
Interfere in a bank

1662
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Mobile Manor

1663
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,168
To try to prevent a party from the legal right

1664
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
Rights and remedies

1665
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,752
Bankruptcy Ford which by the way is only a notch

1666
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Because the plaintiffs chose to sue entity

1667
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
The new

1668
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:48,576
Especially

1669
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,304
Apprentice Thana

1670
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
Sort of Mike Myers

1671
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,424
Latest version

1672
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,216
Delusional

1673
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
Eclipse

1674
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
This is this

1675
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,672
We sued entities that we knew had no ass

1676
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:31,328
Right

1677
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,632
The show will understand this

1678
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:39,776
The first time that robbed

1679
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,848
Is there trying to figure out what the hell it is

1680
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
And Free Speech those payroll the

1681
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,648
Robbed his first sanction for not Abby

1682
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,976
Any clue what the hell

1683
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
I think

1684
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:05,376
And then

1685
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
It's a thing

1686
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,752
It owns the intellectual property it's got the website

1687
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,640
In the part of like why Robert Barnes is no longer on the case

1688
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,920
Shenanigans

1689
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:24,832
This whole thing about enforce OST they were hiding it from beginning

1690
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:34,048
And saying that they're scared of the merits of the

1691
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
Case

1692
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,608
Pulling shenanigans

1693
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,888
Well in the Mist

1694
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,680
Apolina shenanigans

1695
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
Avoid a trial

1696
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,056
No that's why you for 4 years

1697
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:49,920
That because you're afraid of the merits of your case you guys have been pushing it back

1698
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,272
Shenanigans with bankruptcy judges

1699
01:36:54,528 --> 01:37:00,416
That's why you mess around so much

1700
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:04,768
This was a good Refuge when your argument was that the default judgement

1701
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,448
But now say that we are

1702
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,752
Are getting the US like

1703
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,824
He's not

1704
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,384
He's really really

1705
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,432
Out of his element

1706
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:27,552
Places

1707
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,648
U.s. trustee do whatever it was going to do

1708
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,416
No sir

1709
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,232
Hundred percent

1710
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:39,072
A decade

1711
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:45,472
Recline

1712
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:49,824
Giant

1713
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,872
I do think you're saying that Barnes

1714
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,176
Out of this element a lot of places

1715
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,224
He's in his element

1716
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,832
Public opinion types

1717
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:07,232
He was not adequately deployed as the person to be in the courtroom

1718
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:13,632
Doing what he needs to do right here

1719
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,728
He doesn't actually swing public

1720
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
It's there to make

1721
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,384
That's what

1722
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
Plug his ass

1723
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,272
Albert

1724
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
Alternative

1725
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
For people who

1726
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,624
Gabby responsibly on patreon

1727
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,024
What happened several years ago

1728
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,120
Giselle

1729
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,704
Splc that didn't work out

1730
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,984
I don't think so

1731
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,312
Alex asked Barnes

1732
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,104
Tabac him up man

1733
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
Hey man

1734
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,408
I'm broke

1735
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:02,016
No I'm broke back me up

1736
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
Anyone

1737
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,320
Pretend

1738
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088
Infowars

1739
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,624
Is this deluded audien

1740
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,352
Because I don't judge myself my money I spend it almost all I got a decent house

1741
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:19,680
Nice car Healthcare but I don't worship money

1742
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,800
How much money does Alex Jones have

1743
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,664
All of these entities

1744
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
Binu didn't have it

1745
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,480
Discover

1746
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,856
You should dismiss them

1747
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,416
Why is Owen Shroyer

1748
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,208
This is purely lawfare

1749
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,256
Politically-motivated

1750
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,584
Discovery

1751
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,376
He has like $50,000

1752
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Play the bank I mean

1753
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:55,264
Putting on Christmas on the street

1754
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,432
Also the reason

1755
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:07,552
Resources are not necessarily

1756
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:29,056
Oh yeah that is a good point to something about financial Paducah

1757
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
Deposition

1758
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,016
Bought a brand new Dodge Hellcat

1759
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
Fort Worth the price of water

1760
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:45,952
2 wildair that Barnes was like we sat down with them and showed them

1761
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,536
You didn't set down even sit down with anybody we had to file like

1762
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
6

1763
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,584
For sanctions over the course

1764
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
Sears

1765
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,448
Google Map for Alex

1766
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,776
Clips that he doesn't know what actually is in it

1767
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,616
And we just snuck in a clip of the deposition

1768
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,432
The business of December

1769
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,248
I have no idea what this business

1770
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,808
I don't know how to tell you what it does

1771
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Cuz I don't know

1772
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:16,160
Are you the only person

1773
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,744
Sure you really can just

1774
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Suppose this was like the things

1775
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,096
Osborne said in that do deposition he started getting up

1776
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
Talking

1777
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,144
To try to cover their ass

1778
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,704
Compare that to them today

1779
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,264
I don't know I do know I know you've done

1780
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
Deposition videos

1781
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,872
David covered their corporate representative Infante

1782
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,664
Weather

1783
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,968
Basically the s*** out of Robert Barnes

1784
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:46,368
Vagina Jones wrote in an affidavit form testimony

1785
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,208
I like rooting off a David in Connecticut saying yeah Robert Barnes botched

1786
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
The case please don't

1787
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Dismiss our case we got to like

1788
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,072
We got a new lawyer he's going to take care of it

1789
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
We 86

1790
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:10,688
Barnes probably knows about that he's not going to get sued

1791
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,040
Affidavit I'll bet you like honey

1792
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:19,136
Appetite loss

1793
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,184
Assume

1794
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,488
Let's see how well that goes I've seen your

1795
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,096
I don't think

1796
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:43,456
You f***** up your protective order we know how much money you have it's all been linked

1797
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,736
To the Press like that stop

1798
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,272
F****** what are you doing

1799
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:54,464
News according to

1800
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,280
That bubbles impenetrable

1801
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,096
So just just talk

1802
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:04,960
He would have a

1803
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,064
Illiberal

1804
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:20,832
Jury pool

1805
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,624
What are they scared of a liberal kinetic

1806
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,648
Jury pool

1807
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,184
Do you know that even those Jerry

1808
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,464
Bulls when they see the ACT

1809
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
True facts

1810
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Will not right

1811
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,280
Big checks

1812
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:41,312
Mary Hughes procedural tricks

1813
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:47,968
Do you have any response to these bankruptcy

1814
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:52,320
If it be cases are not a threat if there's some evidence is going to come out that's going to protect

1815
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,112
The absolute

1816
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
The first verdict

1817
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:05,376
Then you can probably weather the rest of the cases no problem

1818
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:10,752
You know that

1819
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
You didn't want a case on the merits

1820
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,944
Give me my level of frustration

1821
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,552
You don't need it that's

1822
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
That's a real shame

1823
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,904
Is is this cases of punitive Cason always has

1824
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,304
Actors you

1825
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,632
Just stopped a trial at its doorstep

1826
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,656
God

1827
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,448
Especially from the

1828
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:43,776
Who's literally ran away from this jurisdiction so I can stop

1829
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
Beating him like a redheaded stepchild

1830
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,408
It's basically a correct

1831
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,224
Metaphor to use you should not

1832
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,808
Beat red-headed stepchild

1833
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,344
Beat him like Robert Barr

1834
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,392
Twitches

1835
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
It's a

1836
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:04,512
It's just basically like a bully running away and then being running away

1837
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,048
Hold me back

1838
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,864
A hundred percent

1839
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:13,216
I do think that there is an interesting thing

1840
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,568
Kind of works for the presentation of Alex's show but it does it just

1841
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:21,152
It's so transparent the W / won't you

1842
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:24,736
A debate me you have the case

1843
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,296
No problem

1844
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:31,904
Conversations and

1845
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,232
Mark on the on the show

1846
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,792
I don't believe for a second

1847
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,608
The goal was a default

1848
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,632
Everything

1849
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
Would have led to a trial

1850
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,728
If Alex had cooperated

1851
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,264
And on his piece of it

1852
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:53,664
Very basics

1853
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,688
That's about what I said

1854
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:57,504
I'd love that

1855
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:00,064
You keep destroying all the s*** you said

1856
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,672
Challenge

1857
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,816
It's it's wild everybody

1858
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:14,144
But this is only a question of how

1859
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,192
Never a question of what you did

1860
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
If I come

1861
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,496
But the First Amendment

1862
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,104
About is the beginning of trial you're allowed to ask

1863
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,920
The court to say that certain matters and certain

1864
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:29,504
Allowed to be advanced

1865
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,552
Is that Alex's conduct was protect

1866
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,576
By the First Amendment

1867
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,368
Because it by law it was

1868
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
He said false

1869
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,232
Facts about these plaintiffs he's already got a default judgement

1870
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:43,840
It's already been found as matter of law

1871
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,632
First Amendment

1872
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:50,240
Life is not like a boring of the First Amendment

1873
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,544
It's already been determined that it's not rela

1874
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,616
Today

1875
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,088
If you got 4 years

1876
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,368
To do a First Amendment

1877
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,976
And he actually even though all of the like he talks about it being a kangaroo court

1878
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:14,304
The realities of even of all the bulshit he proved he did

1879
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,840
He got the go-ahead it in

1880
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,888
If you list all the way up to the Texas

1881
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,960
He got he got two layers on the 1st Amendment

1882
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,264
Any any any fell on his face in Boca

1883
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,336
It's so to say that like

1884
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,152
Oh this has something to do with he's being tonight

1885
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,432
Stop that s***

1886
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,272
Annnd ideal setting to their scared it's also dumb

1887
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
I mean at least I don't

1888
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,624
I don't

1889
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,720
Barnes anyway all clear

1890
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,280
Show right now

1891
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:49,632
Seems to be kind of trying to be in cover his ass mode

1892
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,776
His name is going to be somewhat tied to it and he's going to have

1893
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Why

1894
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,664
He was so unsuccessful why everybody else was

1895
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,064
Excuses

1896
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,160
Whether or not they match with reality is obviously

1897
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,536
PR propaganda

1898
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:21,888
You're too afraid to have a case on the merits of using all of these lofty or trick

1899
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,288
Regardless

1900
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
If there's anything behind it

1901
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,360
And you were correct

1902
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,408
Clip

1903
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,456
What tradition was correct

1904
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:41,600
Making some allegations that I'm going to need a response

1905
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
Sweet

1906
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,000
Dismiss

1907
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
And now

1908
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,168
A trial on the merits

1909
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,704
And now

1910
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,728
They're trying to deny

1911
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,080
Skateland scope of this

1912
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
Politicized

1913
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,128
Weaponize

1914
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
Mechanism

1915
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,712
Power

1916
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
His voice is

1917
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,016
Is falling apart

1918
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,552
He should take a breath

1919
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,576
Audrina

1920
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,648
Yeah that is scared me little bit

1921
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,488
The number of allegations

1922
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,536
These denials of motion

1923
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,328
Birthright

1924
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
Denied

1925
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,168
The ability to have a motion to dismiss

1926
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:30,496
Actually Barnes filed

1927
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,776
They had for those

1928
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:34,848
I know that I've looked at least

1929
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
Connecticut

1930
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
At least

1931
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
Perfume ocean

1932
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:42,016
Dismiss at Meijer

1933
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,064
Anyway they had four of them

1934
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:49,184
In fact one of them was so bad that they got they got fine like $35,000

1935
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,720
Completely frivolous motions

1936
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:57,888
Yeah they definitely had all that chance and then the second one was the Motions for summary

1937
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,424
Basically what this is is

1938
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,984
Once the case is gone through some discovery

1939
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,544
You're you're allowed to bring emotion to

1940
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,568
Have certain

1941
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Issues declared

1942
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,456
Overdose issues my community for my damages

1943
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,064
They have the ability to bring those emotions

1944
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
And then they just

1945
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:22,464
Mr deadline-day they had a deadline back in February

1946
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,000
Animated

1947
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:29,632
That was back with Brad Reeves was handling the case and they

1948
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,704
Like a switch over I didn't do it

1949
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:43,200
Yeah I was denied the opportunity to go into the NFL

1950
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,016
Bi-Rite

1951
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:52,416
So then they have these denied the ability Judy's anti-slapp motion

1952
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,464
That's just ridiculous

1953
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,024
Fantastic

1954
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
Because

1955
01:50:58,048 --> 01:51:00,352
A bunch of like really

1956
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,144
How would I describe

1957
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,192
Improper

1958
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:09,056
As we discussed

1959
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:12,128
And as a result

1960
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:16,224
Hey guess what I'm just going to abandon our motion to dismiss

1961
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,016
On the anti-slapp so I don't get

1962
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,088
In trouble

1963
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:32,608
They've been denied the opportunity Bank bankruptcy

1964
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,448
Like it's not my fault I didn't do anything

1965
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,520
Literally came apart at the seams

1966
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,312
I can't even take credit

1967
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,528
I don't I don't even use wasting everybody's time

1968
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,808
Congratulations

1969
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,832
What do you want like

1970
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:56,672
This list is more just like

1971
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,952
This didn't work

1972
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,744
This didn't work this.

1973
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
Ability what it means is we

1974
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:06,912
We weren't allowed to Whitby

1975
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,032
Is little bit like if you've ever

1976
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,312
The stairs that you just

1977
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,080
Your eyes

1978
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,384
And your legs missed if you trip going up

1979
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,152
The stairs

1980
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Very embarrassing

1981
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,248
People see you and your likes

1982
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:26,112
This was somebody else's fault there's no way that I just tripped like today would that be able to

1983
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:31,232
Absolutely all nearby accept responsibility

1984
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,000
Like an a******

1985
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,560
That's what it feels like

1986
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,448
Brings us to the end of our clip

1987
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
It's for this Sunday I feel like

1988
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,312
Is this cathartic

1989
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,848
Who's this

1990
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:50,176
Obviously not

1991
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,968
A normal case everything is half

1992
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,248
Totally absurd

1993
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,832
Couple weeks I've just been sort of

1994
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,112
Often

1995
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:00,160
For my life

1996
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,696
From everything from all of it

1997
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,744
And there is no chance

1998
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:12,448
To get all this out your anger back

1999
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:22,688
Put my head down and go to work I need a dose of bulshit Clips Jordans

2000
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:27,808
I just know I'm just a lot of straw dropping out of it is

2001
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
It's just

2002
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,600
It's it's

2003
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
Get to a point

2004
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:34,208
I mean everything about this case has been so unorthodox

2005
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
End and when you hear them

2006
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,608
Talking about the nice to be able to come on here instead

2007
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,888
Not just that

2008
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,704
Not just that the things

2009
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,520
True or whatever that like

2010
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:51,104
This is so far off the real

2011
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,640
It's Jeff

2012
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:59,552
Different territory

2013
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,600
End in so that's just how you have to treat

2014
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,672
It's nice to come out and talk with you guys

2015
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
I wish I could give you a more

2016
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,584
I just don't know I'm still

2017
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:13,120
Holding pattern

2018
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
I know where

2019
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,448
This bankruptcy stone is over but

2020
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:20,032
To say that that's the end of the stunts would be naive sower

2021
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:23,872
But at least I could do.

2022
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,152
Like we were saying it's kind of

2023
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:31,552
Results

2024
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,600
Deflated now

2025
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,440
Uncharted waters I guess

2026
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,744
?

2027
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,792
So

2028
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
Jumping over

2029
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:52,032
I don't know I'll tell somebody the other day I was outside happened to just

2030
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,568
You watch

2031
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,872
Apocalypse Now the Redux version

2032
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:02,272
Yeah exactly

2033
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:04,832
Robert Duvall

2034
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,624
The Napalm and everything

2035
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,512
Someday

2036
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,536
Nn

2037
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:15,840
God you start to feel better

2038
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,376
You start with feel that like

2039
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:20,704
You've been you've been living on this thing of

2040
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,240
It never ends

2041
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:26,592
It never is always something more and it's some point it will in

2042
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:31,712
Kind of left in the

2043
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,528
For my literature fans out there there's not going to be a good

2044
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,832
It's going to

2045
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,392
It's all going to be over

2046
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:45,792
Buddha

2047
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:50,656
This is never leaving my life that's the thing I've had to resign myself

2048
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:55,264
To do my normal life

2049
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,080
Devote

2050
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,896
To the absolutely most insane lawsuit in America

2051
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,064
Ten Years After The Alex Jones lawsuit we talked to Mark

2052
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,696
Getting involved him

2053
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:20,096
Looking at whether it's

2054
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:22,656
Didn't expect that we thought we would be

2055
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,704
And here we are

2056
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,008
Yeah

2057
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:30,592
I thought I'd be doing a jury in a year-and-a-half

2058
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:35,456
Never quite what what you think

2059
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:41,344
I'm getting you some getting ready for that moment where we switch gears

2060
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,160
This is the trout this is the Reckoning we can put all the

2061
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,696
Bulshit behind

2062
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,488
Actually dude

2063
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:50,304
Waiting for us to do for

2064
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
Before God damn

2065
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:55,168
