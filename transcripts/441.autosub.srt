Air Jordan

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,552
College fight

6
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I don't know why but suggested a little video for me

8
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
We're all in trouble

9
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
Guy's a big news about vaccines

10
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
They're bad

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
It was a video of its kind of a John R I wasn't aware of on YouTube

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
And that is

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
People who are experts in a certain field reviewing scenes from movies about those things

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Is a crime scene investigator or Detective

15
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,496
It's Fascinating People of just like a really specialized

16
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
That's accurate this is bulshit

17
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Is an animal a

18
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,736
Expert like I Wildlife behavioral expert really charming and like

19
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Had some interesting things to say about animals

20
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Through the Heart by started just thinking about how much I love

21
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Love animals like I love my cat

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
And I decided that as part of celebrating this new apartment

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm getting a second animal threatened

24
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,056
But I don't know what it's going to be

25
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
Maybe I don't like I don't hate dogs but I'm not I've never seen myself as being someone who would have

26
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
I'm not not a dog person in this

27
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,720
Although I could get used to it I've lived with jobs in the past

28
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,096
I was thinking maybe another cat but that also seems kind of like

29
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
I don't know if Celine is

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,288
Teambuilder

31
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Go to another cat is some kind of

32
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Like

33
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
But you can't write you can't

34
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,368
You can't get those. Let me tell you something

35
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Maybe I should get a bird

36
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,024
Do not get Coronavirus

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
They're too loud evil

38
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Many reasons not have Birds

39
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
I would think about like maybe a chicken or somebody told you eventually

40
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Chicken inside my partner

41
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm thinking about a hedgehog

42
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Chinchilla

43
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
I'm thinking about a pair of sugar gliders that are cool

44
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,512
I think they're probably too and I wouldn't have enough space without

45
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,608
Now I'm not entirely sure I've got up there's a lot of stuff

46
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
First of all for the

47
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
Removing like

48
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
You know

49
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Getting some more space for some plants Ryan also

50
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
For possibly another animal threat

51
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
Which is first off

52
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
Sugar gliders need a lot of sucrose and you don't have that

53
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
And they need space to Clyde

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't know if you have enough space for but if I get some

55
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,327
Glide all over the text

56
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Thoughts about animals

57
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
Fire to just live in the woods hang out and talk to Deer

58
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,111
Stumble through my shack

59
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
What I'm trying to get the most out of while still living in the city

60
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,327
I'll get a little tiny marsupial to sit in my pocket

61
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
For me there's only one

62
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
Right now and that is TJ Ford

63
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,615
And all that

64
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
And you can donate two of the best things that you can do right now listen to art

65
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Bj4 and give money to people

66
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
For those uninitiated that's run the jewels

67
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
Go to Broad audience

68
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Okay

69
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
They told you

70
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
You are not

71
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Alright they told you again on our team

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
RG. RG

73
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,311
I'm out over and over again

74
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
I always say that and sometimes I'm wrong

75
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
Congratulations

76
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
What happened.

77
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
What happened directions

78
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
See there you go

79
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Stretch of time kind of I guess not really

80
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
Feeling very frustrated a little bit

81
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,223
I don't think his narratives are going anywhere it's the oldest just like a guy who's

82
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Dunham's ad

83
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
Liquors are boring

84
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
What really exciting stuff

85
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Stop going on in the room

86
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,703
Right and you would think that I would be able to rise to the occasion with interesting stuff in his own propaganda

87
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,287
It just doesn't really like you just talks to a couple of

88
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Dead end

89
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
Congressional candidate

90
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
A guy who probably

91
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,039
Man I probably definitely doesn't believe the Holocaust is real

92
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,463
Yeah when you're limited by the dumbest man in history it really does kind of mess with

93
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
With your ability. You know exercise imagination you have to be the stupidest

94
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
There's a mainstream conversation

95
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Putting the military

96
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
Against protesters is a great idea responsibility of normalizing

97
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,831
Since the barbed-wire is allocation neighborhood to be the first building

98
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
You have to be the tip of the spear towards poking burlesque

99
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Responsibility

100
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Not

101
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
You have to also

102
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,799
Not be specific about violent threats Roshe run the risk getting in trouble

103
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,175
Inspired

104
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247

Is meant to provide some

130
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
The money is for testing

131
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
And for hospital bills that may come up

132
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,431
From people who made get coronavirus fantastic being out on

00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223

Necessarily go donate download is an option

135
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
There's a 100 things

136
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
You find the most important

137
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Do you personally I feel like you can help the most

138
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
A local

139
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,679
Locals going to be really important to build communities from the from the local up

140
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Get around the people that you're around

141
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,151
Take care take care of whatever you're feeling is your priority

142
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
So

143
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
I got

144
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
And I know it sounds like I keep saying that but I I've just been trying to get this taken care of

145
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
It's really

146
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
Getting to a point now where I realize like I got a bunch of Seltzer's already that I got it I'm not moving the seltzer

147
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,423
Drink one of them already so it's not like a new thing

148
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
View

149
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
If you were arrested arrested with attend

150
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Intent to deal yet its distribution levels

151
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
Bringing some of them and then I'm going to take the rest to the food bank

152
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
I'm too distracted to even

153
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
I try and bother with a bunch of filters

154
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Apace

155
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Will be fine

156
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
And once we hit the ground running

157
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
It's a new place

158
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
It'll be nothing but could be a f****** Seltzer Palace me and my goddamn sugar glider sitting here on my shoulder

159
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Talking about Seltzer's

160
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
Celtics

161
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
You don't know that

162
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,231
I did not report

163
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,071
Not soon enough my Seltzer heads up there

164
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
We start off the show and we get to start on June 3rd and this is

165
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,359
All that Mark esper Secretary of Defense has come out and said

166
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Let's not do that insurrection.act thing

167
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Job

168
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
We don't want the insurrection

169
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
And they're like no

170
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
Everyone I know either has been robbed

171
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Most the crew that had their mailbox

172
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
All the time now

173
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Covid-19 Asteria

174
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
But the crime he is

175
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
I told my

176
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
My son

177
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
17

178
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Alex is really overstating a lot of this probably to create a lot of fear

179
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,279
I can't imagine why he wants them to feel of the other

180
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
I also like your son was out after 8 or 9

181
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
I don't I don't know doesn't get much more you can't tell me what to do dad then beating a man to death at a 7-Eleven

182
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Just to be clear

183
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,391
Yeah I don't know I think Alex is overstating a lot of this stuff because that's in his best interest

184
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Create a sense

185
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,231
The fever generalized an overwhelming sense of fear

186
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
In the audience very much doubt that he's carrying a

187
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Gun with them

188
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
I think he's full of s*** on that too I mean I know that up to a certain point

189
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Being at least

190
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,359
Didn't have a carry permit

191
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
You probably have gotten one since then but he may not

192
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,391
Open carry a Barrett 50 cal never underestimate Alex's cowardice

193
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
So

194
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,535
You've got these tests that are going on around the country that are

195
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
You know motivated by

196
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Feelings of

197
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Police murdering

198
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
On our black people are outside agitators

199
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
From all the other 50

200
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Nowhere trading them between state

201
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Now that's

202
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,247
I mean some people will make that argument so you know where we're sending a good ones from New York

203
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
Chicago Chicago 7th of January

204
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
No people are people upset about the police murdering people and then on top of that

205
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Not having consequences

206
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
And such Anthony

207
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:06,239
Beyond kept going in a large part because

208
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Some of these protests

209
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
Have been met with police brutality

210
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
And that certainly is a vicious cycle that can continue

211
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
And I certainly upset people me I would say that if you wanted to end the protest about

212
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,671
Police brutality one of the worst ways to go about it would be with

213
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,535
Police brutality it tends to make the protesters argument become a lot more

214
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
It's hard to disagree with

215
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
Right it should be a good idea

216
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Yeah so you and it just so happens that the other day

217
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
For the situation that gave Alex the exact thing that you needed

218
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
In order to attempt

219
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
To invalidate a lot of this stuff

220
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Nashville news

221
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Walden security

222
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Store

223
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Black

224
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
I was very sad

225
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Disgusting

226
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Video repeatedly throughout the show

227
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
Incredible

228
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,999
That is a problem

229
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,351
We're all mad at the same tragedy

230
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Right that's an issue

231
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
I don't want anybody

232
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,495
Right and Beyond this is not so much

233
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,591
Applicable to our conversation

234
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
What's going on

235
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
I absolutely don't that I have any

236
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
Feelings of support for anybody who would do something like that

237
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
Nevermore fine for somebody to be murder

238
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,439
It's not fine and it's definitely not more fine for somebody else

239
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,303
Plenty of coverage about this

240
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
People bring this up weather peon

241
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,215
On Twitter or at least a few news stories about this

242
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
This guy David Dorn

243
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,895
No and I don't think anybody who believes in sports

244
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
What's going on in protest I don't think anybody

245
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,855
Is necessarily afraid of looking at this and saying yeah those those people who were looting pawnshop are

246
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,439
It's like an awful man is an awful thing to do.

247
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
In line with

248
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
What time we sporting with us

249
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Is it going for

250
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,679
But I do think that Alex incidentally can't do the reverse

251
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
He can't look at the inside

252
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,311
To the police brutality against peaceful protesters

253
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
And discuss that is like as if it's not happening at all

254
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
Cases of the police killing people which it happened

255
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,927
Sense

256
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Restaurateur

257
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,631
It's the he can't talk about go so he ignores those

258
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
Where is I don't think the people are ignoring

259
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Mr Dornan the same way that they are

260
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
It's just disgusting to see him exploit that's the way he does

261
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
He plays it repeatedly like God no one cares about this guy

262
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,599
Just it's it's just f***** up

263
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
So Alex

264
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
He has the credentials of

265
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,607
Noble Alex Jones gas tonight is that a video of him got popular

266
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,215
That's all you need do you need the video of him yelling at a city council.

267
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
Little more.

268
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Glamorgan

269
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
He's going to be

270
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Welcome

271
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
Trailer

272
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
Make him so bad

273
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711
Real mr. what

274
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,783
Doesn't respect

275
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
Video

276
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
Suck my dick and choke on it

277
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
He got his got out

278
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,223
Franklin

279
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
It just did to your s***

280
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,367
It's a little too close to Patton Oswalt yelling at Leslie Knope that's the problem

281
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
And not nearly as amusing

282
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
So Alex is going to interview this guy whose name is Tom special up because of this video of him is making the rounds and right-wing

283
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
Circles it's just him yelling at a city council meeting about how the Communists are taking over as all the Democrats

284
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
Resisted arrest

285
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,943
How do you sprain Jess candidates running for office is probably at

286
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
He thinks that Infowars is going to help him win the primaries

287
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
And this strategy up till this point has not been a good one I think it's 0% batting average

288
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
The last Iraq

289
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
No no no

290
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
I think that people like

291
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
Deanna Lorraine yeah those are Naomi I almost forgot her name already forgot

292
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
You're the only person who would

293
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,640
No she lost her primary when she was going to unseat Nancy Pelosi

294
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
Really very close really

295
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,696
Whatever is inside

296
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,328
Enrique tarrio dropped

297
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,424
I can't I can't think of anybody who's been on Infowars

298
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,496
Who has had a successful run in the primary

299
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Fine

300
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
We got one

301
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,944
What is a big knot on your bed

302
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Well he hasn't come back

303
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
EXO

304
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
We got some

305
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Good guys

306
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Becky's going to win

307
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Alex is going to get to that interview in a little bit but yesterday

308
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
Stream to the audience that we're basically out of town

309
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
There's no time

310
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
Wish we had more time

311
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
We don't have more time

312
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
They're going to go For Broke

313
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Stop

314
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Kuwait from prep in DC and fear

315
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Try to make the main move

316
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Running

317
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Operational

318
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Retired generals

319
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Hayden Clapper

320
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Obama daughter

321
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,912
You're never going to get away with this

322
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,240
Prison School

323
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,592
Show me how full of s*** Alex is going to make me realize they like this is a game

324
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
Yeah if you've been preparing for this for 20 years and this was the globalist big move and the Patriots are running out of time

325
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,344
Time he be saying it's time to start shooting nothing left

326
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
I'd like

327
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
This move doesn't like the Patriots

328
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Doesn't work

329
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Game is over

330
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:34,656
Big continuing of doing a show like Alex does in the middle of what's presumably the big one

331
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
Feels like it's just another publicity stunt for him

332
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
Because he's holding back in the same way he always does

333
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,872
Fully committed quote-unquote patriot who was looking to save the Republic

334
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Wouldn't do that

335
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
If time was running out

336
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
This is all just an act for Alex and it's pretty gross

337
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Be out in the streets

338
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
No more party

339
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,240
He says with a couple times I think he might be trying to Brandon ooshirts party's over

340
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:16,384
Decide what you'll be free or slave

341
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
What side you're on

342
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
June 3rd Wednesday transmission

343
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Pause the unrest

344
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
I got to call for his resignation or removal

345
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Fifth

346
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Is coming next

347
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
You can set your watch by

348
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
This is again why this is such a game he's been saying they're right about to do the 25th Amendment for

349
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
Years now this is just

350
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Bland

351
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
It's so boring I just want bring back polonium poisoning sure something good

352
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
Give me a give me

353
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Richmond style they're going to break into the White House pull them out to the f****** ledge and see if everybody wants to chop his head off

354
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Play real quick stuff

355
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,640
Dive deep into the they put a hundred bombs at construction sites

356
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,760
Keep going with that white stuff

357
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,880
Covered this territory over and over and over again even wrong every time

358
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
Wait I wouldn't set

359
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,048
Alex

360
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,400
Trump has come out and said that antifa should be a

361
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,264
Terrorist organization

362
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,592
And actually there's some rest

363
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Sprite plant

364
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Cantera stuff Alex's like this

365
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
The news

366
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Winger's

367
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Wingers are posing

368
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Looters

369
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
There's no looters there's no antifa

370
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Yeah we all meet at the Eagles Lodge

371
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
The publican

372
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
So dumb dumb

373
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Antonio news

374
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Staind

375
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
People he knows

376
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Fairy of the mobster

377
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
Because there was

378
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,824
Tweets flying around about Alex and Enforcer

379
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,456
Around the same time promoting a video of his son beating up a guy at a 7-Eleven

380
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
So it's kind of an easy mistake for someone to make I don't know

381
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
This is your fault Alex desk

382
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
Confusion is your fault

383
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Earned that can

384
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:16,352
But again this is a good demonstration of why you never want to give Alex these sorts of

385
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,168
Abilities to bring these things up as if

386
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
They are

387
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,008
Proof that everyone lies about

388
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312
Every single occasion

389
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,224
So it's hard to say exactly to what extent protests have been infiltrated by Bad actors from the white nationalist

390
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Accelerationist

391
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,576
Community or the Boogaloo types but it's definitely not

392
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Not at all

393
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't know

394
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
How you can quantify it or

395
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
To what extent

396
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
You would

397
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
The address I just don't know how you'll be able to

398
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Yeah it's

399
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
It seems like

400
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:54,496
There's a likelihood of some it is it is a

401
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,872
Tossed around concept people every time I see a protest there's at least

402
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
20

403
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
The kkk's been spotted there

404
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Avoid app

405
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,576
Play for the most part

406
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
It happened but to the point where it's really

407
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
I don't know what I mean

408
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,536
Yeah and m.j. yeah I think there's a normal human impulse

409
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
You saw it with Alex's seapak

410
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
Courtney eats with Enrique tarrio

411
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,776
Hey there's infiltrators in this route every does that

412
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
And so

413
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,872
I do I do think

414
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
But I know there is at least

415
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
One example I can point to clear as day

416
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:43,392
But it would be responsible for me to definitively say if one act of property damage

417
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
Another is being done by one group or another

418
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,304
Do not even going to try and attempt to thread that needle don't know what's going on

419
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Is prove Alex wrong

420
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
About his assertion

421
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,728
That there are no right-wing people infiltrating and pretending to be antifa

422
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,056
And I can do that based on Alex's own report

423
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,152
On May 31st Alex reported on a particularly menacing statements

424
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
That was said to be coming from antifa

425
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Put out on their Twitter

426
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Tonight's the night

427
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
My comrades

428
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Saf

429
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Remove

430
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Hilarious

431
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
White

432
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:34,592
When we discussed this our response was that it was pretty obviously that was a fake Twitter account

433
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
Determined

434
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Bitey white nationalist group

435
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
American identity movement

436
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,904
Formerly known as identity evropa who could have guessed that

437
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Pretty

438
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,488
Very simple as there was Maude

439
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,352
They might as well have had a neon sign flashing we're lying to

440
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
This is a very common right-wing extremist

441
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:04,800
Fake antifa accounts on social media

442
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
Which make left-wing protest look bad

443
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
They do this a lot because it's super effective

444
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,808
In the past days there has been so much conversation and hand-wringing

445
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
For showing up to your white man house and killing you and your family

446
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
It's a tool of delegitimization

447
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,768
We're by the right-wing socopa demonize the larger point of the protests

448
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,888
Imaginary organization that'll scare off the middle-of-the-road folks

449
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
It's more or less an attempt

450
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,032
The pool support in their direction from the center by scaring it away from the other side

451
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,944
Alex played right into this game and actually use an active participant and enabling a white nationalist group to infiltrate the protest

452
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
For him to say it's not happening is

453
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,392
But as we also seen that clip the downside of the accusation Betty bar in the matter

454
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,256
Nadia settings back pocket as an example of how the media lies he can deploy didn't

455
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Dances like this

456
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
You can't possibly believe that their right-wing

457
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
Extremist infiltrating left-leaning protest

458
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
You're the media says that there are

459
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
Please that I burn that mattress

460
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
So nothing is real

461
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
That's the danger that you can begin to see it

462
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,152
So now we get to Tom speziale

463
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
Anyway he says that

464
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
He says it Infowars is great

465
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Which might hurt him in the campaign

466
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Because of him

467
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,952
Because

468
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
Information

469
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
Family

470
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Challenges

471
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
The so-called conservatives

472
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Machine

473
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
Mentalities like this because

474
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Tom's right there when he says that they do is they challenged these

475
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
These narratives

476
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
I just argue that they do

477
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
General

478
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,992
There is a I mean yes absolutely there are many ways to

479
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,832
To challenge something

480
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:31,232
Is the other thing I was going through my mind.

481
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
Not going to like those cues

482
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
Tom gives me every reason to not like him by saying that if you like

483
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
A certain person you'll like him which means I would like him

484
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Jim Jordan

485
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
To you

486
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Go out

487
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Across the swamp monster

488
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
I'm sure you will

489
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:09,632
So yeah I got the father Son and the Holy Ghost right there perhaps

490
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
Yeah you got the guy who yells at city council meeting right corrupt lunatic real estate

491
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:21,920
College coach

492
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Abusing tons of students

493
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
I'm outside

494
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,816
So Alex has his guy on and it's clearly some kind of a situation where like Alex saw this video

495
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:44,704
It was like man that's getting some attention I got to get this guy on this guy's run

496
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
For Congress and he's like I got a boost my profile somehow set myself away from the pack of the

497
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,456
These losers been a Republican primary that Alex is good

498
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Play I don't give a s***

499
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,136
Find your way onto Sinclair buddy that'll give you a lot better probably

500
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,280
So Alex has another person coming up on the show here on the 3rd

501
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
Does have its a primary Bonanza

502
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
He's going through here another person is running

503
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Tough cookie

504
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Is she

505
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
She does support

506
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Organization

507
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
But you does

508
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,608
Laura Loomer is running for office in the 21st district in Florida and

509
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
She does have a chance at

510
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
Then he'll be surprised Republican primaries on August 18th

511
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
And even though she is raising a good bit of money for her campaign she's an embarrassing disaster and I find it very hard to

512
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
Imagine that any significant number of people would vote for

513
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
I think we're going to steal our computers at the

514
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:10,720
What are the main problems for a campaign is that she's already made a bunch of really good attack ads on herself

515
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Like every time he's been on Infowars

516
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
Twitter

517
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Anyone running

518
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
For an election

519
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,592
A wannabe at least six candidates in the Republican primary

520
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Who has a long history and government

521
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,784
Pringles in the Florida house from 1986 to 1992 then again from 1994 to 2000

522
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,416
Time to choose elected mayor of West Palm Beach in 2003 and served until 2011

523
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,768
At which point she ran for the US House where she has been since 2013

524
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
Frank was a strong track record of electoral competence whereas

525
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,704
Just really has a resume full of week shift and self-defeating publicity stunts

526
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,104
Mixed in with disgraceful islamophobia

527
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
Sitting to the children lock

528
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,272
You're so inexplicably to adore

529
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
And let's not forget

530
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,184
Laura Loomer was the co-star with Jacob Wohl

531
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,816
Stupid fake documentary where they where the ilham Omar was married to her brother

532
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
Like she is a disaster

533
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,592
216 election this District went for Hillary by a margin of 59% to 39%

534
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,200
Laura Loomer doing is all for attention if I had to guess to try and get back on Twitter

535
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,624
Yeah yeah give me a exemption for being a candidate for some

536
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
This very seriously

537
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
I was going to play later whenever I would look like a real dick

538
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
Berthelot and I are already on the show

539
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Pictures where Mar-A-Lago is

540
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,592
That's where Trump vote by mail

541
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
Motor belt mail

542
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:08,480
Voter fraud so she's like when I get elected

543
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
Trump will be one of my constituents

544
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Iowa

545
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,952
The president I am a big fan of delusions of grandeur

546
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
So Alex and the snakes flip discusses how like

547
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
He doesn't want to please stay

548
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Everybody likes

549
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,824
What's a police state police state

550
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
Borders control.

551
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
What

552
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Boils my blood will head

553
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Herein

554
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
You're so crazy I decided to extend the big sale we've had

555
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
Jer

556
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Gap

557
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Across-the-board

558
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Torrid.com

559
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
Decided

560
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
Take a loss of everything

561
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
This is just like

562
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,680
We can sell stuff now we probably can't

563
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,032
In three weeks no evil will not be as scared

564
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Yeah let's use it

565
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
So good good good stuff Alex I'm proud of you

566
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,968
Whatever

567
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,344
Whenever Alex says that he's Mister anti-police state

568
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
I love that

569
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,232
Think of who's that who's mr. Steal Your Girl

570
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Who's that guy

571
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
It wasn't that I liked it

572
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,288
Rod Rosenstein testifies

573
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
Was really taking him to the woodshed

574
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
What has Ted Cruz ever done anything

575
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
Grabber tool

576
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Oh

577
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Howdy Doody doll

578
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
This is the last

579
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Justice

580
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Was going after a

581
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
3-star General

582
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
The incoming

583
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
They already said they're going to dismiss

584
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
The case against

585
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
Predicate for all of this

586
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Is the Logan Act

587
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
What you know

588
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Perfectly well

589
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Is Imran Khan

590
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,696
Constitutional law that is never been prosecuted

591
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
History of the Department of

592
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
He should have been laugh

593
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Any response

594
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
If someone is sick

595
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Where can I go

596
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Security advisor

597
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
For violating the Logan Act

598
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Which says

599
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Consistent

600
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
See you today right now

601
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Violating Logan Act

602
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Suncoast

603
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
So who cares

604
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
Out of the room and why didn't you get

605
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
Answers on this

606
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
Why did you let the

607
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
Isle of partisan

608
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Why

609
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Consume the country

610
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Appreciate

611
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Cuz he's a criminal

612
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,568
He's got get away with way which person in this case

613
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:50,944
Really regular thing for propagandists like

614
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
You can see through this

615
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,344
Prism health hazard facilitated by people like Ted Cruz government

616
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:02,464
Wasn't asking Rod Rosenstein a serious question on that cliff

617
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,536
And you're shooting off a ton of ridiculous right-wing talking

618
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:10,144
This was done because Cruz knew that it would be red meat for the right-wing media sphere

619
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,520
It would take some kind of a creature of the deep state

620
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
However in the context of a

621
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,128
Congressional hearing does get to respond

622
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
Things like this and he did

623
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,064
You could hear them starting to respond right before Alex cut it off

624
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,416
Good for propaganda so someone like Alex just cuts the clip right there before Rod Road

625
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Steve has a chance to speak

626
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,304
This accomplishes presenting Cruz's words is the only reality of the hearing

627
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
He's framing of the situation is the only one that's real and by cutting off Rosenstein's answer you make it appear that he didn't have a

628
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Sponsor a rebuttal

629
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
In reality Rosenstein side

630
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
With regard to

631
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
The plan to take that particular issue senator

632
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,015
My understanding at the time that I arrived was the General Flynn had lied to the vice president

633
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
And that I believe was the primary issue that was under investigation

634
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
Oh that's seems really

635
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Right

636
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,559
In the context of the larger hearing Cruz's words look like a petulant Outburst that means nothing and it's clearly a performance

637
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,399
But if you isolate the comments and deprive them of any of that context

638
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:18,751
You can make him appear to be some kind of a meaningful Brave we're not going to take it kind of thing

639
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,383
And it's not it's just a child throwing a tantrum it's kind of amazing that on this

640
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Very same episode

641
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
He makes Ted Cruz looking

642
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Exactly like

643
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Especially

644
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
Or whatever it is like that literally open

645
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
Yeah okay I hate

646
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,743
But that literally like I'm already over my time

647
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
F*** off your dust you're just saying dumb nuts

648
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Yeah stop it

649
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,215
You're stupid.

650
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Kabuki theater

651
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
For a long time Alex is really in support of Donald Trump and his family and everybody

652
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
God dang

653
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Things have changed

654
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,183
Alex is already said that he doesn't like Jared Kushner cuz Tucker Carlson sets bad things about him and Alex Azar

655
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,303
Yep

656
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
Turns out this is spread

657
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
It's no longer Just Jared and Ivanka

658
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
People that know

659
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
What's going on and they literally make fun of

660
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Just like me

661
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
Yeah no s***

662
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Flaming liberals

663
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
Can't no s***

664
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
Who called

665
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Which building

666
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Chinese Donuts

667
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Problem

668
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Yeah

669
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Trump's daughter

670
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Space aliens

671
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Money

672
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Spoiled rotten

673
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
We have a telescope

674
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Get into politics

675
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
Walk-around

676
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
Yeah it guess what

677
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,847
What the only reason they have anything to do with White House is because of the guy you love so much

678
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
So

679
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:39,039
He's pointing the finger at Ivanka about her multi-generational money

680
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
A generation dad

681
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:47,487
It was a Multiverse subtracted generationals he's complaining about

682
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:52,607
Children of next-generation money who get into politics

683
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,935
Is that exactly the definition of Donald Trump insane

684
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,335
Weird blue-collar background

685
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
F****** nuts

686
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Shut up

687
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
God

688
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:11,039
I love the idea

689
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,439
They got to go about this shouldn't be involved

690
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
Got there different ways really stupid still trying to

691
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Find some way to preserve

692
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
Like Trump is seriously actually like does a good job but he put his daughter in some kind of a weird position

693
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:38,175
Vision that she had no business being at because she's related to him turns out

694
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:44,319
Turns out

695
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,903
Fullmetal Alchemist you guys ever heard Alex bring up Eric

696
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,999
What would you maybe that means Eric

697
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
Alex's Source never know Alex admitted that he was

698
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,751
Cernovich is sort of Alex

699
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
That might be why you never

700
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Does on the show anymore

701
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
I wonder if that's

702
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Okay

703
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:18,367
I mean I suppose burning your sources probably a pretty legitimate reason

704
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
Cernovich could very well have been on an episode that I didn't see

705
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,583
Where is it

706
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Is there a lot

707
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
Jared and Ivanka

708
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,495
Good. No longer Maga

709
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
The movement has turned

710
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Is the most

711
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
Thin-skinned

712
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Group

713
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,503
Elitist wannabe

714
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Custer is just one of them

715
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
About the present

716
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
Christiana Mall

717
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
They all are hedging their bets

718
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,519
Can you imagine how sad it would be if there was like

719
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
Some

720
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:14,175
Obama a put Malia into a official position at the White House

721
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,015
Obama supporter radio show

722
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,319
Listen I love President Obama butt

723
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:25,951
Malia is a problem she is a conservative hiding in the administration

724
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
Take a Bow

725
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,655
That idea of Malia Obama

726
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,775
Well we got a hedge our bets nobody's going to take my dad out

727
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,615
Fight with it and let's let's explore that a tiny bit more

728
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:49,759
Idea that Jared Kushner or Ivanka would think they have a

729
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
They're going to survive they're going to be in the New York Times next year

730
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,791
Sing their way through this if you can help us if you can publish some b******* the

731
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,607
W said without lighting them on fire first

732
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,423
Fine as long as going to have an opinion people listen

733
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,823
There is a big difference between having a position that could affect policy decisions

734
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
No chance that either of them will be anywhere near any kind of the power that they are now without

735
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,527
Are you running for mayor of New York

736
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,159
You probably would remedies lose

737
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,559
The idea that they're like

738
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
Yeah Biden's going to keep pushing around a special Envoy

739
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,615
Non-partisan there you got to work for multiple Administration comes inside

740
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,759
Cancel call

741
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,599
Cuz he's got a great track record this

742
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
And how this is so stupid

743
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,743
Just take a second look at the kind of b*******

744
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
He just says those things

745
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
Now it's now it's just

746
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,887
F****** Arch Democrats

747
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:16,287
And I couldn't her vice president

748
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Going to happen

749
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,967
So there's a war on religion early cuz only June

750
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,783
Until the end of the year the war on Christmas

751
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,623
Happens every year the skirmishes Breakout

752
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:37,023
For Christianity

753
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Search for photo op

754
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,143
So that broke out of War on religion

755
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Country

756
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,207
No you're right this is Laura Loomer said there will be right back

757
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,327
I completely forgot that I said that

758
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
Zero respect for her and she kind of just makes me sad you have zero respect

759
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,775
Fionna cuz I respect all people as human

760
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
Respect people's rights

761
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
Yeah and it's just a bummer generally to see what you bring to the

762
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,367
The table in terms of propaganda

763
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
I want to do dresses Point really quick ship

764
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,279
People are really offended by Trump holding up that bible the way that she's pretending they are

765
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,887
Some people are probably offended by how crass a publicity stunt he was trying to pull off

766
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,983
And apparently he's trying to hide his authoritarian Ambitions behind religion

767
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,311
Offended

768
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
We're so because

769
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
How that photo op happen

770
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:02,271
It's been widely reported both by people who were there and is out by Outlets like the New York time

771
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,623
But in order to stand in front of st. John's Episcopal Church and give his dumb speech

772
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,463
Peaceful protesters dispersed with use of rubber bullets

773
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
Pure Gas in Perkasie

774
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Renee

775
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
These were not people breaking into buildings and looting

776
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,727
They were peacefully assemble because the Optics of trump going to the church and

777
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,335
President acted State violence on them to get to believe so he can look strong

778
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:30,687
And undo the damage to his ego that have come from the news stories about him hiding in a bunker

779
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
This is what people are most offended by

780
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
And that includes Rev gini gerbasi

781
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,343
Who used to be a minister

782
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
St. John's Episcopal Church

783
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
Describe Trump's actions as a sacrilege for All Peoples of all face face that are grounded and peaceful

784
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,839
Honest and loving compassion reconciliation

785
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
Wholeness healing forgiveness Peace Love

786
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Compassion

787
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,263
Gervasi was there at the church when the police disbanded the people gathered there

788
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,823
Response to what you saw was quote

789
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,919
When I realized the people have been hurt and terrified for a political stunt

790
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,015
I like offended hardly begins to describe how I feel

791
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Also

792
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,087
Reverend Mariann budde

793
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
The episcopal episcopal Bishop of Washington

794
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
The DC was not so happy about this.

795
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:21,119
She told CNN's let me be clear the president just use the Bible the most sacred text of the

796
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Christian tradition

797
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,959
And one of the churches of my diocese without permission

798
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,543
As a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus

799
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
She also told the Washington Post

800
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,479
I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call

801
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,599
That would be clearing that they would be clearing the area with tear gas so they could use one of our churches

802
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
As a prop

803
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,487
No one's offended by just somebody being religious or at least very few people are

804
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:53,119
What people get kind of pissed off about is when people use religion as a shield to justify their incredibly evil Behavior

805
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
Uber knows that

806
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,543
She's pretending not to understand because it Riles her base up when she acts like people just hate Trump cuz he held a Bible

807
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,895
And riling the bass up and getting people all worked up is what she gets paid to do

808
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
You've everybody forgets the the verse at the end of Luke

809
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
Do you think that they move that giant boulder out of his way you can't move a boulder out of that way they're the boulder was too

810
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:23,839
So what happened Jesus started firing some bullets into the into the into the

811
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:29,471
In order to kind of softened up then he moved it using his superpowers and then he tear gases way out of there

812
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:34,591
All the Romans died he met with his f****** followers they created Christianity

813
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Next thing you know Trump

814
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,479
If you were a right-wing already told Alex that he would probably

815
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,551
Yeah that's probably true that's got to say it but

816
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
Alex

817
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
News going on

818
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,975
And that is that

819
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,839
Alex's read a Robert Kennedy article

820
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,911
That are being tested for covid

821
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
You got a interesting take

822
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Infowars.

823
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
You know

824
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,855
Another Network

825
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
Ashanti Southside on Hayden's television

826
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:38,591
So it's interesting story of Robert Kennedy Jr

827
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Just repeating

828
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
This is basically

829
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
Because it hurts the agenda of the vaccine pusher

830
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,879
That's weird and it's also not true

831
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:56,767
This guy eating Hayden had a story written about his reaction to the vaccine in Staten ooze back on May

832
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
26

833
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,375
Apparently he did get sick after getting the vaccine

834
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
According to his story

835
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:08,287
12 hours after receiving his second dose he developed a fever of more than 130 degrees

836
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:13,151
Stop medical attention and after being released from urgent care facility fainted in his home

837
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
You recovered within a day

838
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,783
So it was bad but not nearly the level of

839
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,087
Make the sound way way worse

840
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,927
Hayden said that he felt more sick than he has ever felt

841
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,255
But quote you was never afraid for his long-term health

842
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,351
He also went on to say quote I don't regret the decision to enroll in this study

843
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,263
What's really tragic is that when Hayden was discussing his decision to go public about his adverse reaction

844
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
You explicitly said quote

845
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
I hope it doesn't

846
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:47,455
Fuel any sort of General antagonism towards vaccines even this vaccine

847
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:54,367
Unfortunately that's exactly what happened just rewrote that Yakety Sax started crying

848
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:58,975
People like Robert chambless hacks

849
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,327
For that 100,000 most Deb they've ever been in their life

850
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
What's an interesting headline

851
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:12,543
So Alex predict that he's going to disappear and no one's going to talk about him anymore because he's no longer useful as a

852
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Vaccine

853
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
Care Share but more importantly Alex

854
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,663
Just you just

855
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Pete's

856
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Inaccuracies

857
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
From

858
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
This Robert report

859
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,831
It's important to recognize what's going on here

860
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
He was among the 15 ball

861
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
45

862
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
20%

863
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Hospital

864
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
You like it

865
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
Alex can't even remember it's moderna

866
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:52,223
So this is a perfect example of how Alex is Audience by never actually checking into any of the information

867
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:59,135
He and accurately as decided to Robert Kennedy is a trustworthy source so he just takes anything he says is accurate which is a bad

868
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
Hear Kennedy is talking about a moderna press release and asserting the three out of the 15 people in the highest dose cohort in this

869
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Study had severe reaction

870
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,655
But if you actually read the press release here's what it's

871
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,823
MRNA 1273 was generally safe and well-tolerated with

872
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
Consistent

873
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,895
With that scene in Prior moderna infectious

874
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Disease vaccine clinical studies

875
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,831
The incidence of a grade 3 adverse event in the 25 to 100 dose cohorts

876
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,647
Was a single participant in the 100 group

877
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,303
Around the injection site

878
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,423
Today the most notable Adverse Events were seen in the 250 dose level

879
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,519
Comprising three participants with grade three systemic symptoms

880
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,823
Only following the second dose

881
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,407
Adverse Events have been transient and self resolving

882
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,759
No grade for Adverse Events or serious Adverse Events have been reported

883
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,367
Alex wants to tell the story 23 out of 15 people in this trial were paralyzed

884
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,927
Who is employer

885
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
But the reality is that there

886
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
Were three participants who had reactions

887
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,607
Everything's like fever or dizziness with the loss of appetite

888
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
This is important in noteworthy

889
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,239
Because it helps to researchers better understand an optimal dose range

890
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
But it's not the sort of thing that's so severe that it ruins trials

891
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
For the vaccine being study

892
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,223
More than anything else that gives more information which is ultimately a positive thing

893
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,551
Particularly because all those adverse reactions were quote

894
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
Self resolving

895
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,159
Alex has no idea about any of the stories he's telling on his show

896
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:41,535
You just has a bunch of extremist sources that he picks headlines from and then he passes along as factual

897
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:46,399
If you were forced to he couldn't explain anything about this moderna study or press release

898
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,983
His knowledge literally starts and ends with the word cities cold reading

899
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,519
From Robert Kennedy's blog

900
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,847
And not just that he believes moderna means mother

901
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
In Spanish

902
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,895
It's true

903
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:03,551
Which is correct that's what I looked into that

904
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,367
Turns out there's a secret form of Spanish

905
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:13,279
Secrets created

906
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
The real Spanish

907
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:25,055
Are 33rd degree Mason

908
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
So

909
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Redwood on East 3rd

910
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
It's not

911
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
No not too much

912
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,343
Show me jump into the forest and he starts the show

913
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,183
It is the 31st anniversary of

914
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
When

915
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Pro-democracy demonstrators

916
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
Run over by Auburn

917
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Realtor

918
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
When the military comes in

919
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
Holy s*** you moron

920
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
Shepherd University

921
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
So there's some real comedy

922
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:15,999
At that time

923
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
The image of the protests in Tiananmen Square is really all Alex knows about the entire piece of history and he's just filled in the rest with

924
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,703
What do you want the story to be

925
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:31,359
You want some protesters to be America lovers and all this because it's an easy peeling story to tell us

926
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Complicated

927
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
The movement that was a part of this is a part of grew out of student unrest in Chinese college campuses beginning in 1986

928
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:44,927
They had a diverse set of priorities so getting into all that here would be a bit much to explain right now

929
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,743
Things really intensified after the death of

930
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Huyao Bang

931
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,095
A high-level politicians as a reformer

932
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:58,239
He died on April 15th 1989 and at that point protest became more serious

933
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,055
Approximately a week later rioting and looting

934
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:05,919
Various cities in China which led to the politburo feeling the need to escalate their response

935
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
The student movie

936
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
On April 26th

937
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,295
The people's daily released an editorial with the headline quotes

938
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:14,623
It's necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances

939
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,207
This is more or less a historical equivalent to Tom Cotton

940
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,791
Recent op-ed in the New York Times title quote send in the troops

941
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,119
Which nation must restore order

942
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,263
The military stands for

943
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,151
Is history protesters continued to organize a demonstrate even launching a hunger strike in mid-may

944
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:41,247
The state responded by declaring martial law and sending in military against the

945
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,319
Particularly the students occupying Tiananmen Square

946
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:49,439
This is all important context that led up to the iconic image of a man standing in front of a tank

947
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:55,071
These things that preceded the standoff can't be ignored when discussing the protest because of soda prizes

948
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
The real

949
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,423
When you look at the events that led to Tiananmen Square it's

950
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,751
It's easy to see how Alex would be calling for the deaths of the students

951
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,615
Breaking out associated with their movement

952
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,687
They were calling for an upheaval of the status quo

953
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,271
The stated made clear their argument for using Force against them

954
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
Many of these details you can draw a direct parallels to the current situation in our country and you see what side Alex is on

955
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
Now like 121 direct Paris

956
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,887
See Alex trying to take that Legacy

957
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
And pretend

958
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:37,567
Some kind of belief that he has that he wouldn't be entirely in favor of crushing the

959
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
The other two

960
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,663
The protest every conservative

961
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:48,063
Even contain if you say Martin Luther King Junior's name in your conservative you should be slapped in the face like it's

962
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Pathetic how dare you

963
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
So Alex

964
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
To make things even worse like

965
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
Alex brings Tom Cotton

966
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
IPad you seem fine with

967
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
Talkin about

968
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
You're being

969
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Official martial law

970
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
What

971
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
Pokemon order

972
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,455
Trump office lights

973
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Okay

974
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,087
Yes

975
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,623
Dcd's rationalization

976
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
Not a good idea

977
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,839
I don't know why that came to his mind.

978
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Not at all

979
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,703
Complaining about

980
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,751
CNN wants white children

981
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,311
To be sad about being white or something

982
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,407
I think there's a little bit more nuanced to what the argument is but

983
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
CNN

984
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Children

985
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
Low self-esteem

986
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Orders

987
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Border

988
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
For the original sin

989
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
The new religion the priesthood

990
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
Country

991
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,407
Police

992
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
Has anybody's premise

993
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
Human sacrifice

994
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
The field goal from the 20-yard line

995
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Out here

996
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
All police

997
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:11,423
What the f*** is that

998
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,447
First player

999
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
20 yard line kick a field goal

1000
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:21,407
Toss it out there alright Alex okay

1001
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,503
You're making sense

1002
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:32,159
Also I tried to find instances of the police killing white children with toy guns I couldn't find any

1003
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,951
All the time

1004
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,255
Alex's is way out of line here

1005
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Which is not surprising

1006
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,095
Aziz big old right

1007
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,079
Bellingcat has recently had a nice sub breakdown of that whole situation

1008
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
If you want to learn more about that

1009
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
If you don't want to learn more about what they're up to

1010
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,479
Don't worry they're fake

1011
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,783
Who is Justin

1012
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
Velasquez just use me

1013
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
We found it

1014
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:08,767
The anti-balaka store us things

1015
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,191
BFDI

1016
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,799
Victorious luxury Georgia

1017
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
That is outrageous

1018
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
Run

1019
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
We know the organization

1020
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Centrelink

1021
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,263
A civil unrest and martial law

1022
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
By Obama

1023
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Brennan

1024
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
Your fake ass porch and documents, logout of your relationship

1025
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:06,111
Presenting it as like such of the like the most concrete solid thing ever

1026
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,719
Something mentally doesn't exist

1027
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,767
For you people stop it

1028
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
They're just not they're not real

1029
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
The command-and-control structure run by Alexander Soros and George

1030
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
Soros

1031
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,943
That's not good I noticed something interesting actually number

1032
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Really interesting things

1033
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:36,831
The first is it Billy Weaver doesn't come back and break her big story

1034
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
Tons of documents

1035
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:47,071
That doesn't happen interesting James O'Keefe put out a new piece of s***

1036
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
Talk about that either

1037
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,543
I hope I hope everybody agrees to just not talk about it the Acme Brick narrative is gone love it

1038
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:01,663
That hasn't popped the other one yeah

1039
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,783
I got Devon's tweeted about our coverage

1040
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,111
Alex's theory that George Floyd

1041
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:16,511
I was mixed up with the cop game

1042
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:21,887
Watters on Fox News repeating some of these ideas

1043
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:26,239
Narrative is also Alex

1044
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:32,639
Isn't pushing back any further because it's made its way to where it needs to go it's made it

1045
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
Way through the pipeline without giving it access to farm

1046
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Then would have seen otherwise

1047
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,951
I find that really interesting these absences and terms of like what he is

1048
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
What he's doing

1049
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:52,351
Conspicuous very strange the Acme Brick one in particular I think maybe he does realize like

1050
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,263
I can't prove is that all that was a weird to an odd person

1051
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
Person

1052
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
S***

1053
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:07,199
Everytime I start trying to be a weirdo I find out I'm using these weirdos

1054
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
And it I think it is entirely possible that like

1055
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
You know

1056
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,575
That sort of talk

1057
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,879
Could lead to violence against

1058
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
Acme employees

1059
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:20,255
Well yeah that's fair because if you'd believe me brick

1060
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,327
Is putting these bricks around and cause all this trouble

1061
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,679
If you could see somebody who's unhinged and just believes it

1062
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
Like

1063
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,847
Seeing somebody who works for Acme rigging like you were trying to start a revolutionary war by 20

1064
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
Lawyer being like

1065
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
You can't you can't do that

1066
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,599
You can't because if you get pressed on it all you can do the back that up and point to the stunad video

1067
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Hurt

1068
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
You are fuc

1069
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
Yeah

1070
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
I think maybe that

1071
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,095
That might have been

1072
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,751
She's too busy working on the pulling a computer chip out of a homeless person

1073
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
What's a season finale dad

1074
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,991
So also another thing that happened is that

1075
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,367
Matt. He came out and said that Trump is a threat to the Constitution

1076
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,415
Good work assholes

1077
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
F*** him

1078
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,743
Pic of former Trump

1079
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,839
Blanc de Blanc f*** off you're not wrong to feel that way

1080
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,447
Day late dollar short

1081
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,519
You know to the trolling game

1082
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,919
A high-level General saying this stuff might be worth something

1083
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,479
We'll talk a****** barely even

1084
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
Address the story

1085
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
Coming out

1086
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
Even Alex can see through this b*******

1087
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
We Bennett

1088
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
Absolutely

1089
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Was that Napa

1090
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
Good rebuttal

1091
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:14,943
Yes I don't know

1092
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,759
Malaysian for butt

1093
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
I don't know if that's the case but yeah Alex going to just invalidate his comment with that and then talk about

1094
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Slavery

1095
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
No

1096
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
So in the next clip

1097
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,815
This is really funny

1098
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
William Barr

1099
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
Attorney general Barr

1100
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,983
Speech that Alex realized you'd have to cover live

1101
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,639
And a big part of that was Alex thinking that he's going to talk about antifa

1102
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:49,247
He doesn't really get to that at the beginning of the speech at all and Alex gets

1103
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
Super bored because we cannot allow people

1104
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,743
Lease to behave in the ways that led to George Floyd

1105
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
And Alex like this

1106
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,583
Is not working for me now so here's what he does

1107
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
That sounds right

1108
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
Nothing less

1109
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Is expected

1110
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Leading

1111
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
Can I drown robots

1112
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
What are we doing X-Men

1113
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
Watch watch

1114
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,767
Are the Sentinels coming is that what's going on

1115
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:40,191
Commercial

1116
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,799
Talking about there's a difference between protesters

1117
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
And Alex

1118
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
Custom-made Queer as Bill Barr is talking

1119
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
That even

1120
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
The peaceful protesters

1121
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
Alex

1122
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Exercising

1123
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Amendment right

1124
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,423
There's no real difference he thinks that anybody who's doing anything hate America so whatever

1125
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,263
Beyond

1126
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,103
So are we at the end of Bill bars

1127
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
Very frustrated for

1128
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
Because he's not getting what he wants

1129
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,807
Which is Bill Barr being like I'm going to arrest George Soros

1130
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,087
Tonight

1131
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
We are going to deal with

1132
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
With a Criminal

1133
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
Those two are involved

1134
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Hayden

1135
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,071
Okay well the Coppola George Soros

1136
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Obama

1137
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
General

1138
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Leadership

1139
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
Good morning

1140
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,079
Needless to say any

1141
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,455
I can't handle just turned off

1142
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,183
Won't they kill reimagined anime

1143
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
Is pretty mad about that

1144
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
Frustrating

1145
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,815
Told yourself that was what was going to happen

1146
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
True

1147
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:16,703
So in the next wave Alex's get them to one of his standard predict

1148
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:21,055
Can games whenever retentions get really high in the country

1149
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,591
You'll see Alex

1150
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,383
Predict false Flags

1151
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:30,783
What are the functions that this serves on sublevel Alex

1152
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,599
One of these right-wing groups one of these

1153
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
F****** dudes

1154
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,695
All my buddies know how to build bombs just going to go

1155
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
Crazy on some level knows there's a decent chance of someone to blow something

1156
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,167
Something

1157
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
So he's building that

1158
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
Assassinated presidents

1159
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Going to do it

1160
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,343
Obama's load up a fuel truck

1161
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Roundup on

1162
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
Hotel room right now

1163
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
Brainwash Looney tuners

1164
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Everywhere ready to go

1165
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,383
There's no way to stop

1166
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
Leadership

1167
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
Which is

1168
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,215
Everything

1169
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,847
Because the globalist are going to break your back

1170
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:11,135
Really trying to talk quick going out to break their

1171
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,439
Yeah like that's so boring

1172
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:18,559
Imagine right-wing gun nuts

1173
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Hey we're here

1174
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:24,703
To protect you so if any fake white nationalist come here with giant machine gun

1175
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,519
We're going to kill those guys doesn't seem likely

1176
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,311
I just

1177
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
I am so

1178
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:33,407
This stuff is like

1179
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
Is it's farcical

1180
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,503
In-N-Out Things Are

1181
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,855
You know I don't know things are changing but there is a mood

1182
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,903
In the world that

1183
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,719
Tends toward the possibility of a different

1184
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,767
Right there's talk

1185
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:52,095
I've seen some people wanting to

1186
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:57,727
Dismantle Police Department

1187
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
Floatin around dismantling police departments and rebuilding something that serves people better than what we have now

1188
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,663
Now it only took a few hundred

1189
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,711
Great but there is a very

1190
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:12,831
This wouldn't be possible without people coming out into the streets and the

1191
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,879
The conversations that this provokes

1192
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
AMV ideas

1193
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
We word

1194
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Lose our ability to

1195
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,559
Dream in such a

1196
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,031
Identity in his right wing

1197
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,383
S*** that huge be like okay they're going to be coming up

1198
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,431
Like he does every single time

1199
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,551
Like he's treating this like any other circumstance that is ever happened throughout his career

1200
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
As opposed to

1201
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,719
I don't know something that has the potential to be something far more

1202
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:57,887
I would rather this country burn to the ground then share my spaces equals with non-white

1203
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,679
That's what he might as well

1204
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:05,567
Where you coming from

1205
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,639
So Alice is another Gaston

1206
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
Quite a while

1207
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,551
Sucks and he's not running for office

1208
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,391
I'm really excited to have hotep Jesus whether the balance

1209
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
The hour

1210
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Social media

1211
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Real name Brian

1212
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,287
Hotep Jesus is a real piece of s***

1213
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:42,687
That's a coffee from Starbucks as reparation

1214
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,295
Videos of these employees are such a white Cox that they've just given

1215
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
Free coffee

1216
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:53,951
As someone who used to manage a Starbucks I can tell you that employees are trained to give free coffee to people

1217
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,255
I know that a lot of coffee is just going to get waste

1218
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
Did anyway

1219
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,327
Any amount of Goodwill they could be gained by giving

1220
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:03,167
Coffee to people in need is far more valuable then demanding payment

1221
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,823
At our store we have some people experiencing homelessness who would come in pretty much every day we give them coffee you say hi chat with them

1222
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
A little bit

1223
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
Never charge them

1224
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:17,247
This dude's video was based on faulty premise which is used to make a pseudo racist point so congrats

1225
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,063
You guys should really consider

1226
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,135
Calling in the cops to really escalate that situation

1227
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,719
You know that idea of giving somebody a free cup of coffee

1228
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,023
That leads to socialism Dan

1229
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,887
That is socialist that's why we need an overwhelming military police present

1230
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,191
To go in there and make sure that that

1231
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,751
-4 Cent cup of coffee Estates

1232
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:45,407
I mean the reason for his stunts in the first place was those two

1233
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,943
Boxer

1234
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
And they're like

1235
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:54,623
Set up a video of Starbucks is racist I want my coffee

1236
01:19:54,879 --> 01:20:01,023
Yeah whatever is everything is faulty and all of it is just counterproductive

1237
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:07,423
An article in The Daily Beast

1238
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,007
Holocaust denier was created truth

1239
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:17,920
He released a video earlier that year he said quote alright isn't afraid to call out the Jews and their implications in the destruction

1240
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
The black community in America

1241
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,016
It's just the truth you can't call me anti-semitic if it's

1242
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,784
The truth

1243
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
You don't want to be a guess

1244
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,392
Explicitly white nationalist Outlet red

1245
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:32,000
Gave a message to the almost certainly not existent black audiences that program

1246
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:36,096
Do not like you they hate you they think your s***

1247
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,240
He was a promoter V pizzagate conspiracy theory eyes that eating soy makes people gay

1248
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:48,128
Despite being an anti-semitic conspiracy pushing idiot hosted by people like Joe Rogan

1249
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
Laura Ingraham

1250
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,688
Men turning point USA

1251
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,784
Hotep Jesus was on Joe Rogan show

1252
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
What

1253
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,832
What

1254
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:04,000
I'm guessing that I returned his calls anymore

1255
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560
Some

1256
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Annie just

1257
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,448
Please give me a black person to pretend that what I say isn't insane

1258
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,752
I think that this is like

1259
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,800
Also like hotep Jesus is available

1260
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,872
Because it was awhile back that right

1261
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
Call Alex Jones

1262
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
Infowars

1263
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,064
A few media Outlets

1264
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,880
Media Outlets to reach out to me

1265
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
10 frame

1266
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,720
Yes less

1267
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,912
Let's start off by pointing out that no one wants to talk to me

1268
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:49,312
Start off by saying good-bye voice is not

1269
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:55,200
Censored there's no other explanation they are trying to silence me

1270
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
Let me start off by saying I'm glad you bought my book because I have sold literally 02

1271
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
Talking about how I feel

1272
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,584
Don't give money to Black lives matter right there somewhere battery

1273
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
You can give your money

1274
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
She said her friend

1275
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
Donation

1276
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,896
Black lives matter

1277
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,344
Is going to go towards the destruction

1278
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,536
There's only one group

1279
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
In fact

1280
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,312
All about

1281
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:57,408
You keep saying black lives matter what you need to know is black life matter

1282
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
MetLife

1283
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Is me

1284
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,224
Oh boy

1285
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
Weather

1286
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,648
Are we going to talk in here about something that is

1287
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
The reasonable

1288
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
Concern I guess what is being used

1289
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512
Unreasonably

1290
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
And that is a fact that these are large Gatherings of people and they're happening while there is still a concern about

1291
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,472
Covid-19

1292
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,800
And the weaponized this idea a bit

1293
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
What

1294
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,992
Social distancing

1295
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
The social distance

1296
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
I wish that were true

1297
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,120
Top scientists and governments are come outside with all basic and make lights

1298
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,960
Phase always know there's some

1299
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:13,184
Jordan honestly I can see in your face exactly what your response is going to be and do for it

1300
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,792
It's always going to be a messed up video of making the point

1301
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,352
Dying but making this way

1302
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,264
Thank you Alex male the problem

1303
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:32,128
But beyond that there's a baseline misunderstanding

1304
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:36,224
It's still pretty unsafe for people to be out protesting in these big group

1305
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,064
But I just generally speaking while they're still covid-19

1306
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:45,952
Steps

1307
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
Sunstate apart is much

1308
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,864
But the reality is that there's probably no way to fully social distancing protest like this

1309
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,216
And that there is a risk of people protesting that they have except

1310
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,288
Yeah because they believe that the underlying cause of the protests

1311
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,312
The movement Airport

1312
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
Are more important

1313
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
And

1314
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
Happy

1315
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
Agree

1316
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,320
I'd like to take a moment to compare these things to the stay-at-home order protesters that we're Gathering

1317
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,416
I like last month so I can illustrate why this isn't analogous at all

1318
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,744
These protests are built on a foundation of a Cause

1319
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:25,120
In the case of the current protests it's police murdering people at least not facing consequences when they do so

1320
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,776
As the protests have been going on there's been a rash of police brutality directed towards the testers

1321
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
The scope of

1322
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Complaints

1323
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Which makes sense

1324
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:39,456
Stay-at-home protests cause was their ability to shop and go get haircuts

1325
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,040
They weren't rallying for the right to go back to work they were rounding to send

1326
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:47,904
Others back to work so they wouldn't be as inconvenience to slightly as they had been

1327
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440
And felt they were at that moment

1328
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:54,304
I can understand them feeling intensely about that but I also really don't agree that it's a very strong

1329
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Point

1330
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,632
These two complaints matters

1331
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,936
Yaki protesting right now is risk

1332
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,800
So for people to commit to doing it's important they have a firm conviction that a meaningful cause

1333
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,616
From my position to current protesters do have that

1334
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Whereas the folks from a month ago

1335
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
I meant beyond that

1336
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
You have to consider the safety measure

1337
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,904
In the case of the protesters from month or so back there was a high level of virus denialism among them disregard

1338
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,696
Idea that there could be a problem

1339
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:25,024
In the current case that's not that's not so

1340
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
People wearing masks

1341
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:31,168
People have been very vocal about how people who feel sick should stay home

1342
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:36,544
I've seen a number of people imploring everybody who went to go protest to get tested

1343
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,944
It's a quarantine afterwards and like I mentioned our friend SNL cast member Chris red organized the GoFundMe

1344
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:48,064
Throughout these protesters get to pay hospital bills they come down with covid-19

1345
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,696
At the point this recording it's raised over $240,000 which will go a long way towards making sure

1346
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,256
And people who attend these rallies or able to get tested

1347
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:00,608
And thereby know what actions to take if they need to firmly Courant

1348
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
What have you

1349
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:07,520
Large group of people coming together like this for an important cause is not necessarily terribly dangerous thing

1350
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
Provided the people handle it responsibly

1351
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,408
We'll see how that plays out but the people who are involved in this protest

1352
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,944
Reminder

1353
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:19,552
There's a heavy streak of mutual Aid that runs through it and that extends each other

1354
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,392
Keep each other safe so I don't foresee

1355
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
The being as much of a

1356
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,720
Problem as some other

1357
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:31,328
Large Gatherings could be but it's it it would be foolish to

1358
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,144
Pretend but it's not a risk now it's absolutely

1359
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,192
And it's it's

1360
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,240
Really a bummer

1361
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,800
That it is or maybe it's actually Nessa

1362
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,592
Maybe the only reason that we can

1363
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,872
Can really finally

1364
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
F******

1365
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,432
Do this s***

1366
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,480
Is because we have been sold

1367
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Trapped and so

1368
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,576
Held hostage by the coronavirus in

1369
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,624
Everything is been exposed

1370
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Snow desk

1371
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,280
Maybe I don't know if I don't I'm so awful that it uses coinciding with the f******

1372
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:05,632
I don't know

1373
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,192
I just don't to

1374
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,752
I felt

1375
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:14,080
This cancer

1376
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:18,688
Really worried about the possibility that there could be a sharp increase in cases

1377
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,272
That would be unfortunate

1378
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
You know what I was thinking is the words of that dumb f*** lieutenant governor where he's like people if the old people are will

1379
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
Willing to die for the economy

1380
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,256
And in this situation

1381
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,840
A people are willing to die for the possibility

1382
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,144
That's finally having some sort of social Jay

1383
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,008
People are willing to die as we've seen on a daily nightly basis

1384
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,360
People are either under threat or they have been murdered

1385
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
This is too big

1386
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,200
To say no

1387
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
You know

1388
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,992
Sure

1389
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:59,392
Misunderstandings

1390
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,160
Coming from

1391
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,696
But I disagree

1392
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Using the

1393
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
Orally

1394
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,120
I've been this next clip though we find something that I just think it's

1395
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,680
Is more intentional and his misinformation

1396
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,592
Is he

1397
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,640
Lucy won this year

1398
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,432
Just Happening Now

1399
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Election year

1400
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
Cycles

1401
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,256
So Google Transit and interesting tool

1402
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,304
It's also one that's super easy to misuse

1403
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,864
Like how hotep Jesus is right now

1404
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:47,520
If you go and look at the trends for the term black lives matter you'll see a spike currently and wanted 2016 which he's asserting

1405
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,056
Is because it's an election year

1406
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:53,920
But the fun assumption to make but this biking 2016 happened on the week of July 10th

1407
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:58,272
What does just after Alton Sterling and philando Castillo were murdered by the police

1408
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:02,624
It's also right after that sniper in Dallas shot at the police killing five

1409
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:08,256
Good reason

1410
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:14,912
There's also spike in August 2015 that wasn't an election year had to do with the aftermath of the Charleston

1411
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,544
Also there's a very different dataset you can find if you search for black lives matter all one word

1412
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,872
So I've no idea

1413
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:28,480
This is an example of him taking some numbers and then writing a story about them it's based on nothing

1414
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:32,064
Conspiracy thinking run wild and basically doesn't mean anything

1415
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
You can do that with Google

1416
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,648
It's really easy to try and

1417
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,696
Come up with an argument based on

1418
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,464
Website

1419
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,488
Traffic and search

1420
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,256
Terms

1421
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,072
And if you don't do it responsibly and look for

1422
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:49,216
Context was like okay there's a lot of people interested in this thing at this point why is that the case

1423
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,288
If you don't engage in that level of context

1424
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,336
Trying to mislead people

1425
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,616
Pure

1426
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:59,200
And it's it's such that if you if you do

1427
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:02,272
The people listening to Infowars alike holyshit how do you even

1428
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
Find Google Trends in firm

1429
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,624
You know like it sounds like you're at

1430
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,928
Check this is Wizardry

1431
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,584
There's a lot of stuff going on in qanon circles right now

1432
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,960
And such

1433
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,240
Believe that

1434
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
September

1435
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
Yes

1436
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,128
September 9th

1437
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
Aaliyah ride

1438
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Yeah

1439
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344
So

1440
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,624
I want to say

1441
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,928
The significant date

1442
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
White Sox

1443
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,424
Yeah yeah.

1444
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,752
Look at this. I think something else happened

1445
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
Oh wait

1446
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
December 11th

1447
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
You see how they

1448
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
Put that date

1449
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:08,576
Right under something that are allowed in the disguise thing I see how you put that date

1450
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,392
Meaningless

1451
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:17,792
Nothing nothing is more obvious than 19 years after September 11th

1452
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:21,120
That's that's the golden hour for them

1453
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:27,520
Find information about Hillary having to testify

1454
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,312
The Buzz

1455
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,128
Links to anything

1456
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
Sure

1457
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:39,552
I found another blog called Josh WHO news

1458
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Who's being brought by Judicial Watch

1459
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:47,232
This article doesn't say the Clinton has to testify it's just that the case of currently adjourned until

1460
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
Templar Knight

1461
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,328
Story about this

1462
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,888
CNBC March 2nd

1463
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
This kind of

1464
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,936
O'Reilly's

1465
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:02,336
Apparently what happened is the Court ruled that Hillary has to testify in a deposition related to this lawsuit about

1466
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:07,968
It seems like what happened is that Hillary appealed that decision in the appeals court which is currently adjourn

1467
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,016
Pick up the case on September 9th

1468
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:14,368
Can't find any reliable evidence that says that she's supposed to testify on that day

1469
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
But here we are we see how these guys

1470
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Record on this stuff

1471
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
Speculation

1472
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,768
You're mongering any Logan 9/11

1473
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Impressively stupid

1474
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,656
Good stuff just all around Hillary was pretty short is like

1475
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
Come the f*** on you know these guys

1476
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,496
Stop it

1477
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,592
Exactly

1478
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:39,200
So Alex plays that video of hotep Jesus going to Starbucks

1479
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,904
You know nobody wants to come here the new stuff everybody wants to hear the hits

1480
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
Really

1481
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
Basically on

1482
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,512
Undercuts the entire point of video

1483
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Freak out

1484
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,664
Starbucks employees are trained to give people free coffee

1485
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,504
Things to do

1486
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:20,416
That datapoint really doesn't prove my earlier the kind of tends to indicate

1487
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:26,048
Just wanted you to go away

1488
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
Maybe

1489
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,400
Maybe that's part of the training

1490
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:36,800
Hotep Jesus is talking about how they're all out-of-towners in mini

1491
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Minneapolis

1492
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,384
He's not updated his story yet

1493
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,664
Still working on Old talking

1494
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,528
Governor said in Minneapolis

1495
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,600
95% of the people that were arrested were from out of town

1496
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:03,168
Did not get the update on that story

1497
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:10,336
The press conferences that had to be walked back

1498
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,616
I'm sure that

1499
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,456
These bail funds that are going around that are largely

1500
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,088
Her folks were protesting by the police there are tons and tons of those people

1501
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,416
Donating to bail funds right now

1502
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:31,072
Dakota Jesus believes that all of this money is just going to rioters and looters is not

1503
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
Baccarat at all

1504
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,912
And then based on his last

1505
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:40,288
95% of these folks being out-of-towners

1506
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,080
What do you say after this

1507
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Hilarious

1508
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,640
People that donate

1509
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
So basic what you doing is your

1510
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
Community

1511
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
This what happens when your

1512
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
Up-to-date

1513
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,584
Information that's available

1514
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
When you

1515
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,888
Cover your eyes

1516
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,424
And cover your ears

1517
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,712
Blind facts cuz you're not up-to-date

1518
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,296
It seems like he was trying to ironically claim hotep

1519
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,600
But man does he live up to being a hotel

1520
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,440
Really lives up to it he's going

1521
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,512
You know

1522
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:36,096
So Alex asks his daughter

1523
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:38,144
Alex's daughter who's 12

1524
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,472
This is kinda interesting because

1525
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,824
Twelve-year-old daughter

1526
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
Donate to Hotel page

1527
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
Tell her

1528
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,600
Media industrial complex

1529
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,184
Industrial complex in

1530
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,000
Make people believe

1531
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:09,888
So interesting Lee Jesus complained about the media when he was on red ICE 2

1532
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
But you see that shows a little more openly anti-jewish

1533
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:23,968
He said quote the only thing that makes white supremacy a thought in people's minds is the media and the media is controlled by who

1534
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,040
The only thing that makes white supremacy if thing is music and

1535
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,064
Control

1536
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,856
The movies Hollywood

1537
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
Controls that

1538
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,160
Control

1539
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:38,560
White people don't control that

1540
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,608
Who controls these Banks

1541
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:47,264
This is the world you that hotep Jesus espouses and he knows what to make his message palatable to Alex's broadcast

1542
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
Down a little bit

1543
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,616
All the Slick bigots do that when they come on Infowars

1544
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
As you see that from all of these people

1545
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,064
It's all these folks who are pretty deep into Holocaust denial will never directly say those things

1546
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,088
Show

1547
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,672
Because they know that there is enough of an audience that Alex has

1548
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:11,072
You could probably get someone over to you but if you come out and you're like six billion is a fake number

1549
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
That kind of s***

1550
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,656
You're never going to get them to take the first step

1551
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:20,288
Once they've taken three or four steps in your direction might be able to Spring that on them

1552
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,824
Hard water

1553
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,152
They were right all along

1554
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,736
If you're trying to open

1555
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,760
With the audience

1556
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:33,088
Alex's they are selling his audience to bigot

1557
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,136
Yeah pretty cast

1558
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,160
And you can't

1559
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:40,768
It just is unjustifiable if you come Out Swinging with bigotry

1560
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:46,144
Ratchet says to me is that Jesus hasn't listened to the show for the past 4 months

1561
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Because now

1562
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:54,080
Swing away buddy is that 80-yard field goal people other than like Steve

1563
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:58,176
Speak a little bit more carefully Steve don't give a fuk

1564
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,712
Just like

1565
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:06,112
I have humiliated out is unimaginable I can say whatever the f***

1566
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
Alex's

1567
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,000
It's over for him

1568
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:17,376
When do they sound really interesting I think Alex might have been eating or something

1569
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,936
But there are a bunch of times when

1570
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,472
Hotep Jesus is talking

1571
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
And

1572
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:28,896
Stop stalking clearly done with a thought and then Alex does not come in doesn't try

1573
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:35,040
Event start another thought

1574
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,368
Consciousness community

1575
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,232
Just on TV that supported by the Liberals

1576
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,768
Movies in Everett

1577
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
If you look at

1578
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:58,848
That's very weird for Alex's show was never here

1579
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:05,248
And that's not an instance of someone politely letting their guests for second pause

1580
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,320
Must not have been in

1581
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:13,952
Or something bizarre

1582
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,144
Here's hoping that he would keep he was hoping that he can ride it out for a little bit longer

1583
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,984
Yes sir willing to just talk and talk and talk for no problem

1584
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,288
Natural end

1585
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:35,456
Pause the starting of another cop

1586
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,016
Having a natural end of a thought that's true

1587
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,808
So we have this is a clip

1588
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,600
Episode

1589
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Episode

1590
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,208
Who is LifeWay

1591
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,328
I've Jordan This is 20/20 shirt

1592
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,568

01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
Give Michelle

1594
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Something really

1595
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,016
I'd like to do

1596
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
Something

1597
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,576
Studio

1598
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
Really awesome

1599
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:20,256
You name the time if you're ready to jump on a plane please come I'll Finance

1600
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,840
Dot-com we love you we appreciate it

1601
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,424
This might be one of the only instances where Alex gives

1602
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,776
I really like taking my body

1603
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
I would like to

1604
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:37,408
Deport you back to the very beginning of his interview

1605
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
No other media Outlets are calling situation

1606
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,344
T.i.

1607
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,648
I found this really interesting you know like you have

1608
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,416
Almost

1609
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:51,232
No very little progression in terms of

1610
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:55,840
Interesting things about the narratives that Alex is pushing or building around this

1611
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,656
Just an anger at protesters

1612
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,704
A resentment about

1613
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,032
Secretary of Defense esper not wanting to use the Insurrection Act

1614
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,872
You know that's kind of all the

1615
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:14,528
The same time there's a we're running out of time there is no time left that still intensity

1616
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,600
An interview with

1617
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,416
Zoo weird I was running for office

1618
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,440
