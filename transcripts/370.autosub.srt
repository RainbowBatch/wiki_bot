00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536

Jones Jordan

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,704
Have you ever been on the receiving end of a random act

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Kindness

8
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
Strange

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
Oh yeah

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Yeah I'm sure we've got some people who are

11
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
Random act of kindness song

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Journal Patriot

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,024
Wow I can't remember the exact Pacific

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
Would someone went out of their way to get my wallet

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
Oh yeah and I remembered

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
Just the amazing relief of that like it was crazy

17
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496

We lose your wallet you

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
Various things

21
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
They're tough to replace licenses

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Credit card

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
Security card my wallet for a while yeah yeah

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Card number

25
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
I just thought everything was over

26
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Went out of their way to

27
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
License back

28
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Nothing was missing from it it was

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Gerager moments like that

30
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
That I definitely of experience

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
But they're not

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
There's not it

33
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
Total Wireless stick out my head is much I can remember single heckler

34
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,880
B but there's some random acts of kindness and like man that was really nice

35
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,256
But that guy over there like

36
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Removing alarm Max's one guy who mildly inconvenience to me I'm going to think about for the next decade

37
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
That's not good value

38
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Nice moments more future

39
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,712
I'm so drunk today we're going to interesting episode 20

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,600
I must buy my memories random acts of kindness but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
So today Jordan of course

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
On Mondays we're generally back

43
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
In the past going over to

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
2013 has progressed after the Sandy Hook shooting and the boss

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
The bombing now since nothing important has gone on in the proud

46
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Alex Jones has

47
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Received

48
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Very bad piece of news

49
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
Rodger stone is going to prison

50
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,880
Has been found guilty on all seven

51
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Look at it

52
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
2 years in prison but of course he's not going to get.

53
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't know any static slow but I would be surprised if it's more than like

54
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah that's kind of where I'm at

55
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
How much time to serve

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
I would be surprised if it's more than

57
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,920
Kobe silly for us to guess at this point

58
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:07,296
So whatever what will happen will happen will learn along the way but if he gets 50 years in prison

59
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,136
That'll be the most hilarious

60
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
I don't think so kind of against that way too strong

61
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
Even as much as I hate Rodger I think

62
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
I'm against

63
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Long prison sentences I have to

64
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,567
Continue to be against long prison sentences despite

65
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
F****** awful Rodgers go to Shorter prison sentence for him I'm not positive

66
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
Productive Rehabilitation that

67
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,623
That's like saying Jim Bakker was rehabilitated you know

68
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
I don't know what you

69
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
To do cuz the issue is you got to take away or somehow mitigate his ability to be a you know as they say

70
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
I don't know I don't know what I've going to prison

71
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
Achieve that goal he's not going to learn a lesson

72
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
No there's no lessons to be

73
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,127
Knows I don't I don't like I don't pretend to know the right answer

74
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
But whatever the case is Alex

75
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Thinks he's going to get 50 plus

76
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
Whatever I'm so we have to go over this because it's an unfolding Saga and Alex's life so today we're going over November

77
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
14th and 15th

78
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Of 2019

79
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,911
Which is I guess what would that have been Thursday and Friday of last

80
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Antisocial

81
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Thursday the 14th

82
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
Is when Alex still doesn't know what's going to happen

83
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Rodger isn't setting

84
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
It's still Friday

85
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
So his behavior before sentencing

86
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
And after

87
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
I think you'll see

88
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Behaviorism

89
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Great okay

90
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
Right so what we'll enjoy that is

91
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,463
As we go along before we get down to business day we can take a moment to say thank

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255

93
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095

And unfortunately they are both

104
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,591
People who have maybe correct pronunciation

105
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
This is a Redemption

106
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
Thank you so much you're now

107
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
And I do thank you so much

108
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
What's the business that heroin

109
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Is freakishly large

110
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Cooking the books

111
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Indeed we would

112
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
So Jordan

113
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
Before gets out of business lets out here and I will contact drops

114
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Today Show

115
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
I was in court once it asked me what Tik-Tok is

116
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
I'm curious too

117
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,287
I don't like that when he was on the stand was he under oath whenever he had to answer

118
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Just been in the lake

119
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,687
The Halls

120
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Tik-Tok

121
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
What do the Daleks say

122
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
That he has his answer to that very pressing

123
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
Question

124
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,327
So Jordan today like I said this is The Saga of Rodger

125
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
Anza Alex

126
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
On the 14th Song of Ice and Fire if you want

127
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
All the 13th Rogers cases still ongoing

128
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
And

129
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Alex behaves in ways that

130
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
I think probably cause some problems

131
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Rogers trial

132
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
He's on Aaron his big position

133
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,855
Is essentially that this is going to be a railroading

134
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
They won

135
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
2

136
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Basically

137
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Will Rogers town as we all know

138
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
And once I set the precedent

139
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
That they think they're going to Railroad everybody else

140
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
And it's real tearing

141
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Miss Weldon lot of people up

142
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
And I learned a lot of really horrible things about the trial from the stone Camp last night

143
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
This morning

144
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,927
And this whole thing is a lot bigger than Rodger Stone this is about due process in this country being flushed

145
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
On the toilet

146
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
Because wants to process has gone if you think there's already tearing in this country

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Well wait we'll get as bad as

148
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,007
North Korea probably a lot worse which ended everything real big in America

149
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
I'd like to point out that the yesterday on his show Steve pieczenik was on talking about how do process doesn't work at

150
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
United States at the joke

151
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
What's the prob get rid of it

152
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
I just need a guy in the Department of Justice

153
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
He will throw people in prison I don't know

154
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Yeah it's already had a very trusted gas.

155
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Process in America and it's not

156
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
For me it's for them why is it happen

157
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
Alex's is primarily focused

158
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Stone Rodger Stone

159
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
But he's also

160
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Touching in on the

161
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Inquiry

162
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Largely

163
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
His take on it is dismissive

164
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
You know it's

165
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
It's more less

166
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Covering any of the substance

167
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
Bill Taylor

168
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Ukraine

169
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
They just sort of just letting a lot of that stuff I think go on that run reruns

170
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Pufnstuf

171
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
And all that stuff because they are

172
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
They are not really happy with what's going on

173
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,087
It seems like Alex is in the same camp he's not going to same route as a lot of these other media Outlet

174
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
But I've seen whether their coverage is it

175
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
This is boring shows

176
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,143
I'm so it in terms of the impeachment he has a weird.

177
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Ashlyn expace

178
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,031
Did the Democrats are now calling for their not to be a trial in the Senate

179
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Just give the house

180
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
Vote the impeachment proceedings initiated

181
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
Where are they have the trial they're claiming that do not work

182
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
Weather show trial

183
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
So the Senate doesn't need one

184
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Where do they have a real trial Trump

185
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Will be totally

186
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
And completely exonerated just like Rodger Stone would have been

187
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,095
In the center of town will be found guilty

188
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
I don't

189
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
Do if there's a lot of truth to it Alex a while ago I'm sure it was

190
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
A procedure needs to be taking people to be fine

191
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
And I don't think that I've heard many voices and

192
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Democratic or less

193
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Sides

194
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Have any faith

195
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
That the Senate is going to vote to remove even if the impeachment makes it through the house

196
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
He thinks that that's going to proceed that way

197
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Right will nobody does

198
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
The problem is

199
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Everybody on the right agrees

200
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
We can handle this

201
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
And Trump is really trying

202
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
In hard to make it today

203
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Like if Trump

204
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Would just be

205
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Quiet

206
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,615
I swear to God everything would be fine they they've you keep up they have 40 Senators vote to exonerate him

207
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,455
He be fine everything would go on he probably win the election but he keeps

208
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
What does it mean

209
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Where's David

210
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
We're trying

211
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Yeah

212
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
It's a it's a little weird he predicts Rodgers going to be found guilty

213
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Feel guilty

214
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
So Alex it goes on his predict

215
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Hiiraan

216
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
As you can see very conveniently sets up

217
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,359
The whatever the case even if he's guilty he's not guilty now

218
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
I am predicting other Rodger Stone will be found

219
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Guilty

220
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
The

221
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Rig jewelry

222
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Believe me is it rape

223
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
I'm major Democrat

224
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Official nearby ministrations husband work the Mueller probe

225
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Was

226
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
So I can put the journey when we suppose that said you should have Obama

227
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
Real rear anybody else that work for my level on a jury

228
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
They said I should be arrested for jury Tampa

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Totally legal

230
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
We know that they're bunch of other Obama officials Hillary officials and spook from the CIA or indeed

231
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
On that jury

232
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Bonjour clearly with supporting

233
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Stone

234
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
She fell down yesterday and hit her head

235
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
It was replaced by an

236
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Alternate juror as they call them

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
No you can't make this up

238
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,151
Alex later says that she was like in a pool of blood like a real sensational

239
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
I don't know

240
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
I was I don't know I haven't been following this

241
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
I just like that it's really easy for Alex to come up with whatever disparaging think he wants to say about something

242
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
These jurors because it's in d.c.

243
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
The odds are in the jury pool there were going to be some people with

244
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Full service perhaps

245
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Given that the last

246
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
Years prior to 2016 was during

247
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,847
The Obama Administration makes sense that some people might have some of that in their resume

248
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
Yeah you can make up whatever you want about any of these people based on a resume thing like I read a story that's

249
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Someone on the jury had had work to the IRS

250
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,439
Now we get to turn this into a text whatever you want to do you can do

251
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
The only Jerry they would accept is

252
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
Everybody was a long-haul truck driver but they were independent

253
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
And they all had Trump bumper stickers on there or not

254
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,103
So there's no indication that I can find if there's any foul play in the jury with Rodgers trial but it doesn't matter

255
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Alex made such a huge production and production out of trying and failing twice to identify the potential juror to work for the

256
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Obama Office of Management and budget

257
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
So now that narrative

258
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Verbally in place

259
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:56,511
That woman didn't make the jury Alex is completely wrong about everything in that story but because he established it as a

260
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Clear indication of railroading

261
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,631
All he needs to do to prove to his audience that Rodger was set up in

262
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Yell about that person who didn't even end up as a jerk

263
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Real flimsy work but it does work

264
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Yeah that's

265
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:14,431
I can't find any evidence of an elderly woman juror who is pro Rodger fell down and hit her head which I'm sure Alex is

266
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
Bring up to suggest was an inside job

267
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,879
I'm guessing this is just based on the person who collapsed in the courtroom on the first day of preliminary jury selection

268
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
That story went around

269
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,743
When Rodger was also getting food poisoning or whatever

270
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,071
She's turned into a woman who is ahead by a camp

271
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Lipstick and we've got

272
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
There's no reason to think that person was even a

273
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Potential juror let alone an actual one

274
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
I would say probably impossible they made the jury considered

275
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Collapsed and received medical attention on the day the jury would be collected so if that's what he's trying to bring in I'm not sure

276
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,271
Michael Jordan flu game that she came back

277
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
MC f****** mailed the jury questionnaire I'm not saying it's impossible that someone was replaced by

278
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,791
Alternate juror that is entirely possible but I can't find any real information about this

279
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
And later the only information Alex has

280
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
It's coming from Joe Biggs

281
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Right there

282
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Right he was there at the courtroom

283
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
And

284
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Guisados

285
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
That the woman juror who gets replaced

286
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,735
Was anti Rodger the other way around

287
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Right

288
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
I don't see

289
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Any real

290
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
Cuz he knows out Rodgers going to be found guilty and

291
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
I need

292
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Defense

293
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
So Alex

294
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Brings up any talk to rod

295
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
Like a night the 13th

296
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Credibly

297
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Important point in human history right now

298
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
I can tell you that when Rodger is convicted

299
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
And I'm almost always right

300
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Maybe a miracle going to happen

301
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,943
You know I talked to him last night he said only a miracle of God right now

302
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
It's going to

303
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Stop this

304
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Judging reason to

305
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
They'll even harder

306
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
But I talked to her in the courtroom and they said that the jury shakes

307
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
With hated him

308
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
And stares at him like they want to kill him

309
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
In their virtue signaling

310
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,263
To the media and the all of the intelligence agency operatives and Obama and Hillary officials

311
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
They're in there

312
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
Staring Rodger likes want to kill

313
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Alright

314
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
So you know this is not a fair trial

315
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,879
Irene if everybody staring at him like he wants to Caleb's taking with hatred

316
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,047
Only on this show have I took with her

317
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
I don't know if that's

318
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
The common phenomenon

319
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
I don't believe any of this this is just coming

320
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
From bullshits

321
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
Rodger fans

322
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
At the trial

323
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,127
We're just trying to come up with whatever narrative is possible to computer the

324
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
The trial that's all that's going on here

325
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
I could

326
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
Guess at human behavior assuming that most of these people don't have a wide breadth of knowledge Rick

327
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Rodger stone that weed

328
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Rather than shake with Jesus

329
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,327
Chick with hatred they probably all just got to roll their eyes a bunch of every talk they're like

330
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,167
That's obviously bulshit but guess what the court

331
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Rodger didn't

332
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Talk

333
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Nice

334
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Smart he didn't try and defend himself

335
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
Text messages

336
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,999
What does literal evidence of you'd witnessed a area

337
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Horse

338
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
You sent a note to one of the jury members that you'll give them $50,000 that's what kind of tampering you're doing holy thing

339
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
You have

340
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Lake

341
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
The only possible outcome of you testifying is being asked a question that you don't want to answer

342
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
Whatever just like

343
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
From everything I could tell

344
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,831
Rodger and his team were just alike let's get through this

345
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
And hope for a light socket

346
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,023
We don't want to plead guilty but we don't want to cause too much trouble

347
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
So

348
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Anyway

349
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Whatever

350
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Alex has talked to Rodger

351
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
But he has to be very careful

352
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
About what he says

353
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
All right I have talked

354
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Rodger Stone

355
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Last night in this morning

356
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Talk to Allah

357
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Reporters

358
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Work in the trial

359
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Today

360
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Where

361
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Are you closing

362
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
The defense

363
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
The prosecution

364
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Ended

365
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
At 10 a.m.

366
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Eastern

367
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
About two-and-a-half hour

368
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Play It Again

369
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Rodger hasn't violated

370
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Getting into the case with

371
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
He just said

372
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
God's hands

373
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Praying for a miracle

374
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
Porter's

375
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Not reporters

376
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
If he talks about the

377
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Obama officials

378
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Not just the one that weeks

379
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
And as soon as the verdict comes out

380
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
You're going to get to learn about what

381
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Is undoubtedly

382
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,399
The fakest trial I've ever heard of in US history

383
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
There is not a lot of information that he produces after the verdict approves this is the fakest

384
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
And I love the way this always works as like he yells about some

385
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Something natural obvious

386
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Real world

387
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Conclusion of the thing happen but he takes credit for it

388
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,671
Like that person wasn't going to make the jury obviously not going to happen

389
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
He screams about it knowing that

390
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
We exposed

391
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,167
We did it guys elotes Unfortunately they had more than enough

392
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
To convict him on account of

393
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
You did it

394
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Again

395
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
Saudia Airline

396
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
Tends to be that Rodger didn't do anything wrong

397
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
And the Trump obviously

398
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
Like Rodger got Trump elected

399
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
And like you

400
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
Come through for the guy

401
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Alex

402
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Trump

403
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Rodger they're all still connected

404
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Really weird

405
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Hell I got invited

406
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Allah going to go to the secret tunnel

407
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Is that a family emergency

408
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Rodger Winn

409
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
And I'm not telling a secret

410
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
We would not tell any secrets about the secret tunnel to describe that tunnel

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,672
Apparently I was got invited to go to the secret tunnel

412
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,280
Rules are not necessarily things that are very exciting except two children

413
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
Exploring around you find a tunnel very exciting

414
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,544
A way to what

415
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
It's good to know that our president

416
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Really does lead into the super villain James Bond style aesthetic even his marahlago state has Steve

417
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Ygritte f******

418
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
I would assume that makes some sense

419
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
Especially

420
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Now that he's the president

421
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Right

422
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
If you going to be there like you got to have some likes

423
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Secure area

424
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
That's got to put something someplace where you could go into lockdown or anymore

425
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
I don't I don't think that it necessarily being something like there's a secret

426
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Pizzagate basement

427
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
Or whatever

428
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
And I also do tomorrow

429
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
Mary's got a little pet way down there

430
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
Court sure

431
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
Like underneath the Willis Tower

432
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Sears Tower

433
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
If you're tired

434
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Yeah I don't know

435
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
I don't know how secret this is because I very little interest

436
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,288
And finding out about the architecture of Mara Lago and never have had much in

437
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
That might be like a like a

438
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Poorly kept

439
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Secret or whatever but

440
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
I've never heard about it

441
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Alex

442
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
The first person to bring it up to me so

443
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
I feel like he's revealing secrets

444
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
I don't know

445
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
But the truth is that the globalist

446
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Just hated Stone

447
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
Rodger

448
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Because he gave

449
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Great advice

450
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
Obsessed with him

451
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
He was

452
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
President great advice

453
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Is it Go Back 40

454
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
4 years

455
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Estonia to be prompt Swingman

456
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Dating

457
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Antrum

458
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Beard

459
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Antrum

460
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Not having a beard

461
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Homosexual sex

462
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Beards go the other way too

463
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Your body does a

464
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Girlfriend

465
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
When you're famous

466
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
People don't know

467
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
You're out with your girlfriend

468
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
That's what stone

469
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
The way back

470
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Okay

471
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
I love

472
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,800
I love that this is the level that we've reached

473
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
Brought this up before in the past

474
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Very focused on it in this

475
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
I got now that Rogers on

476
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Trial

477
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
Like he's really bring it up and I don't know if like

478
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
This is an attempt

479
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
To like

480
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Humanize Rodger

481
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
I don't know if it's an attempt to make us all think about Rodger and Trump both having slept with the same woman

482
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
Andy Gibb pretending that that's okay whatever it is is weird everything about this is a family show

483
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Tell anyone

484
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
What's the type of

485
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,872
You don't tell people because that's very unrelatable you had a date the same women

486
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
I get bigger

487
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
She f*** my girlfriend

488
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
Checks

489
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Spent all this stuff

490
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,984
Family show Family Show

491
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
I would say if they are adult

492
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,664
People getting in fights over girlfriends that they share they are children

493
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Yahoo

494
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
I don't think this is a good defense against makes Trump and Rodger both look really childish and

495
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
Little bit little bit territory little bit possessive I haven't understanding where they can both date the same

496
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
Same women been fighting over that woman is

497
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,656
Very gross that is an inappropriate type of behavior

498
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
If you're in for a penny

499
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,336
A pound woman that you're dating into a thing

500
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
They are fighting over it

501
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Man that sure seems to be something that

502
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Trump has a long track

503
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Seems like it might be

504
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
So I don't think this is good

505
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Defense

506
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
I really wish that there was

507
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
I really wish the mainstream media would twist

508
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Play story

509
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
So I could get a

510
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Fantastic Chiron

511
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,936
I have just Stone and Trump Eiffel towered say woman just moving it on or didn't

512
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
How to get ahead of the story

513
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
I got a

514
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
So like I said Joe Biggs was on the

515
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Rainbow JoJo bow

516
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:29,248
Rainbow Joe big band here is him contradicting Alex's narratives about the replaced

517
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
We're expecting it to be

518
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
It's not good in a we've seen it has been

519
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,952
From the get-go but we're all hoping for the best one of the jurors got sick

520
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
She was a lady that would actually kind of snarl

521
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
At the sight of Rodger so she's not been replaced with someone else

522
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
That could be good news he never know so I'll know Alex's position was that they replaced you're with someone who is pro Rodger

523
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,640
Apparently the person who's there on the

524
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,992
This woman snarled at Rodger so her getting replaced is actually

525
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
Probably a good thing yeah

526
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
What can't have it both ways

527
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
I guess you haven't you know what you

528
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
You can if you're Alex forgot

529
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
I forgot so Alex is kind of surprise

530
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Like how much he's

531
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
Worried for Rodger

532
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Which I think is strange

533
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
McKenzie

534
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
The two of them got very close over the last few years

535
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
I would be surprised if he wasn't really worried for Rodger

536
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
He's going to prison

537
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Yeah I know

538
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
Think Alice likely

539
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Alex is familiar with

540
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,992
Stealing such as like

541
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,808
Hair for another human being I still think it's

542
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
Primarily selfish in that like if Rodger goes down I'm an actor

543
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
Self-centeredness to it

544
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
But he surprised

545
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
I'm really

546
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Surprise

547
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
How much are

548
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
I like the

549
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
He knows the bed

550
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Dangerous Game

551
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
I just watch them

552
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
Systemically

553
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Riggs media

554
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
Rig the indictment rig the jury

555
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Learn the judge

556
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Snorting

557
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Witnesses

558
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
Rodger was not not allowed to have any Witnesses

559
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
The defense didn't call any

560
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
Right cuz then they would be asked question

561
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
Or the discussions would lead to

562
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Yeah he did

563
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,384
Or the people that Rodger could call he would want to lie for him like who would be his

564
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Randy credico

565
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
Testifying against him

566
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,880
Rodger doesn't want to call Jerome corsi to the stand so good

567
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,952
No but it's really good for the court of public opinion

568
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,560
Like it's really good for Alex that Rodger didn't take us and it didn't call any Witnesses

569
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Because

570
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,680
Externally you could look at that as the judge didn't let him take the stand

571
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
If only Rodger could have got up there he would have been Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men on trial

572
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,224
Admitted to the crime too so they're good about it not important to you

573
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
He would have gotten up there

574
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
And destroyed

575
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,904
But because he wasn't allowed to rise f****** Railroad

576
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
It's a perfect thing

577
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
It is really good

578
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
Yeah yeah

579
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
So Alex doesn't he talks to Rodger

580
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
And part of that is it now he's going to deliver a message

581
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
From Rodger

582
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
And I think that this is not good

583
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Anybody donate money to me

584
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
It gets to that

585
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Of course

586
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
But I think this is not good for anyone except

587
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:44,320
If you look at it from a game theory perspective okay Alex is the only person with a positive alcohol I like that

588
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Stand up for down

589
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Copperstone

590
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
And as soon as I was making some calls this morning

591
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
We don't want

592
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
She want she called

593
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Home

594
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,496
WoW professions that nobody gets totally legal this to Danger

595
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Question jurors

596
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Corinth

597
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:11,712
The entire law profession

598
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
But I can tell people

599
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
This is what Rogers wishes are

600
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
And

601
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
But not just me up here coming up

602
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Plan free ride

603
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Rodger Stone

604
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
That's Rodger

605
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
Do you want to meet you'll say it's not

606
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Partner

607
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
So Alex is introducing that he has a message from Rodger and it's really crucial that he's stressing that this is what raw

608
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
Rodger Watts

609
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Because the trial is still going

610
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Right

611
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,760
This is a murky territory

612
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm not sure anything is necessary illegal

613
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,624
I am that but it's a bad strategy

614
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,256
I really don't like how often in regards to so much of the stuff we have to say I don't think

615
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,888
Necessarily illegal it's a gray area

616
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
Probably should be illegal

617
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
In certain

618
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:11,872
I'm not a bit of it strains Elder the technicalities

619
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
You can just released

620
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,064
Somebody else's name who's not a potential juror for

621
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
And that's fine cool

622
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
Alex says Joe Biggs on the scene rainbow joke

623
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Rights and

624
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
Yep he apparently is a part of a

625
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,400
Plan that Alex is launching which is Rogers wishes

626
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
Aziz Express

627
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
And it's not a good plan

628
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Hyperbolic

629
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,336
Joe obviously you've been let in on the plan

630
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Even when he is

631
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Convicted

632
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Tomorrow

633
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Good news along the Route

634
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
We need

635
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Everyone to go

636
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,952
White House is surrounded for days we need more people to come there

637
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Forging process

638
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Attache

639
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Enchant free

640
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Rodger Stone

641
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
Again you just had Steve pieczenik on anti due process

642
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
But

643
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
I think there's nothing wrong with encouraging people to go to the White House and demonstrate but I don't trust

644
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
The Joe Biggs is going to be a responsible person to be involved in that

645
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
Seeing as he has posted videos with a spiky back or whatever running antifa

646
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
You got out with

647
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
Proud boys like I don't think

648
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
This

649
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
The indication that Joe is quote in on the plan leads me to suspect that this will be a very poorly care

650
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Carried out demonstration

651
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
You know I just always think

652
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
It's a good idea to put

653
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Notoriously

654
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Violent

655
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,616
People in front of it and leading them up I think that's just a great way to deal with

656
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
I think it's irresponsible

657
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,736
Okay it's done it's done with like

658
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,624
Permitting and people behaving themselves and no proud boys

659
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,024
I would like that the idea that people would go and just like hold signs and protest for Rodger to get a part

660
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,584
I don't really necessarily think that's a bad thing

661
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,424
Bad idea would be a bad thing

662
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,752
Which I don't think is actually likely at all at least

663
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
Not until

664
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
The possibility of trump winning in 2020

665
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
If you wanted 2020 then I think there's a good chance he would pardon

666
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
But then again you pardon Joe Arpaio any just part of guys who got convicted of war crimes right so I don't

667
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
No anymore

668
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,952
Well it turns out that America doesn't really care that much about war crime

669
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
People

670
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Essentially create

671
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
Internment

672
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
It really care politically about Rodger Stone

673
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,776
Do be a real shity feeling if you're Rodger and you see this news of trump pardoning

674
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
These guys

675
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Rogers like

676
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
Killed three civilians why didn't I kill anyway. Me what I

677
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
All I did was get you elected

678
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,904
F****** president's illegally committing all these right way I should have said that

679
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
So Alex

680
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Like you said already he has a message

681
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
Rodger but he hasn't said the message

682
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Ladies and gentlemen

683
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
To you

684
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
From

685
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
Rodger Stone who's got

686
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
Who is facing certain

687
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
My view

688
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,624
The hands of a

689
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Ford

690
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
And the railway

691
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Judge Jackson

692
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
The federal courthouse

693
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Present

694
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
For Donna

695
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
John Trump's longtime

696
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Wingman

697
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Why are you empathetic

698
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
Political advisory stat

699
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
But he is trampling me

700
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
What you get for being discreet

701
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
President wingman

702
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,112
He's trying to stress it because of I think he wants to really play up the idea that they're trying to attack

703
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Trump support network as opposed to being Rodger did things that are illegal

704
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Tubi

705
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,328
Punished for it

706
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
Selah

707
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Why do you keep bringing that up

708
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,336
It ain't like I said he has said that in the past

709
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
But it's real

710
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
Pushed on this episode he's really pushing that really hard

711
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
And I think it is to personalize

712
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
It's it's because

713
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,856
If you think about him

714
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,976
This is just Trump's buddy they go f****** hang out on the weekends have a good time

715
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,352
Pureref

716
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Helps reviews

717
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
Chaplin genocides occur in all of this

718
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,312
That Rodger Rodger likes to f*** with his buddy

719
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Yeah

720
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
So he keeps teasing this message

721
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,224
Very weird to me I don't know what I think about

722
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Dodgers Mets

723
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
To you

724
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
And

725
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Careful

726
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
About what I say

727
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Because they'll try to

728
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Prison Locker

729
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
But

730
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
And

731
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm not

732
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
Why would you tease me

733
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,384
Why would you say I'll get to it at the bottom of the hour

734
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Why would you do that if you had a message

735
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:40,064
A desperate message from Rodger stone that he wants you to disseminate to your audience

736
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Why would you do that

737
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
It seems like you would be like

738
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,744
Listen women leave the show with this this is really important

739
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Rodger is you know what the jury is

740
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Is deliberating as we speak

741
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
He is

742
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,960
Political prisoner that you would get to it

743
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
Got to be a big message

744
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
I suppose in

745
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,128
20 ft tall flaming letters on the planet

746
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
It's God's last message to his

747
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Something longer

748
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
I would feel like

749
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
The sense that this is

750
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,392
Teasing for the sake of trying to

751
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,024
Build anticipation try and get people to tweet about it get more audience tomorrow

752
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
It's going to be it's going to be something about

753
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
IC

754
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
I get a sense

755
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Of that because

756
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
An empty know what what's Difficult about it is like

757
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
The behavior of like

758
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,920
Getting to the news right ahead or teasing it is something that Alex could do with something with real or fake

759
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
Bright

760
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,808
Unpredictable player with this sort of stuff

761
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
They're like a normal rational human

762
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
I would see that behavior as

763
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
An indication that this isn't real

764
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Right but with Alex

765
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
I really don't know I don't know

766
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
Anything's possible

767
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Junkball

768
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
But he's going to get to that later

769
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Coming down the road

770
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
But for now he's got to get too big

771
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Important

772
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Rolling Stone

773
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Witnesses

774
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Calling it

775
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Bizarre

776
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Sacre

777
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Size parties at Redbox

778
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,368
Feds probe Adam Schiff dressed like a Gyptian

779
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Bizarre sack

780
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
5 parties at Ed Buck Smith mansion

781
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
I didn't even know that

782
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Rolling Stones

783
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,896
You're not understanding how news work

784
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,528
If you knew that and then you called him and even wears a pedophile

785
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
You can't just say it first into me like hey

786
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
Check that out it turns out I was right

787
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
First things first Alex is doing one of his old trick

788
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:01,120
Next year he's taking the story those publishing a shity right-wing blog never gets any stories right like troop on it and

789
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
Pretending it's a story in an outlet that has editor

790
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Operates by some standard

791
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
It's like Rolling Stone

792
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,824
This is just a story on true pundit and like most of the s*** on that site

793
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
It could just be ignored

794
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
But this story is actually really interesting

795
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,504
If you read the article it says that shift was Grace dressed in

796
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,856
Egyptian Garb of the FBI's probing him as part of his routine present

797
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Redbox

798
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Math party

799
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
Since the story is being reported you might expect a law-enforcement source you might expect someone with the FBI

800
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Given the comment

801
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
You might expect us supporting story out of literally any

802
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,752
Media maybe a local news Outlet something you don't get that

803
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,312
This entire story is based on one source

804
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
And it's a good friend of ours

805
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
Noted hard race enthusiasts Larry Nichols

806
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
This article. Larry Nichols

807
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
It was in October

808
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,000
Alright

809
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,400
This article includes a quote from Larry about the quote this guy is kinky

810
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,520
We're going to we're going to need to talk to Larry

811
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,408
You know he's old don't call him now closed will try and get ahold of him

812
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,968
We got Larry Nichols phone number but be you anymore

813
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,552
Beyond the sourcing problems here this article is just horribly written

814
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,904
Give him the chip was said to be dressed like an Egyptian the article literally says quote

815
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,000
We can make a leap year the partygoers were likely worshipping pyramid

816
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Kids of math

817
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
This is terrible writing

818
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
So-so

819
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,960
Spiders that correctly if you are dressed in Egyptian garb

820
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Going to a party

821
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Chances are

822
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,896
As we all know from our history

823
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
Clearly the Pyramid of Maslow

824
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
This is a perfect demonstration of something Alex does a lot

825
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,672
One of his associates often Someone Like Larry or John Rappaport and don't lie to another media Outlet

826
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
Let that has zero journalistic standards

827
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:07,584
That I was at with publish Alex's friends claims with Sensational headlines and no scrutiny

828
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,448
Then Alex gets to turn around and report this as if it's solid objective reporting that is

829
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Completely independent

830
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
It's an interconnected web of liars

831
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
But it's very interesting

832
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
You see Larry Nichols getting back

833
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,992
I haven't seen hide nor hair of him on Alex's shows in September 21st 2017

834
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:30,880
When he threatened to Blackmail Congress on air as a good day but it would make sense for him to start getting more active now

835
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
Clearly Alex and he's not alone in this

836
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,768
Was trying to create the narrative that Hillary is secretly running in 2020

837
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,328
If you need someone to smear people in Clinton's orbit

838
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,912
Larry is your guy he has got the fake receipts

839
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
For 30 years

840
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Hold what you got all the fakir

841
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:51,104
Anyway the point here is that the true pundit story is s*** until confirmed by anyone who knows

842
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
What confirming

843
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
For now this is just Larry Nichols

844
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Talkingshit

845
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
That's that would be that's a fun game

846
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
True pundit where you get to

847
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,183
So it seems like he was wearing an Egyptian outfit so we can assume it was pyramids of Beth

848
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
What kind of place give you the latitude to make that kind of

849
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,095
Got2b great jobs Punjab

850
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
If I was smart

851
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,703
I'll go work for that

852
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
That's it

853
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Professional wrestling storytelling right there but at the same time nothing they do can make me feel as good as

854
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,247
Is when I'm listening to Alex telestory be like

855
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,087
Moment of Revelation

856
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Decider

857
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
Nichols is back

858
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Nickelback

859
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
Well I think that what's old is New Again

860
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
You know and I think

861
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,583
As Alex is trying to ramp up into this

862
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
This pretending Hillary's running

863
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
Again what he's got to do or what

864
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
Ruby has to do this but it makes sense to do it

865
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
You got to start going back to what worked last

866
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,407
Do you ran a campaign against Hillary four years ago

867
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:02,527
What did you do back then well bulshit that Larry said was really helpful

868
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,367
Yeah start recording on other outlets covering lies Larry says

869
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
I'm at one of the other things that Alex

870
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Tries to pretend wasn't

871
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
What he did is pizzagate stuff

872
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
And so

873
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
What do you know we start to see

874
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Zpizza gate ship popped

875
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,775
Weird-ass toughman Hillary and her foundation had got caught shipping all those little black kids out of Haiti a bunch of ended up

876
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Dad

877
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Disappeared

878
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:33,247
Van Jones man Jones knows full well that got a taste for black

879
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Meet

880
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
Devil worshippers want that blood

881
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,535
I got to get the black baby

882
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
Nothing about her

883
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,423
Cuz he knows where he gets the money from

884
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,543
Thinking pointing meme say I'm the racist cuz I don't want to kill

885
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
Black babies

886
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Every other day I maybe they'll

887
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Get their hands on

888
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
Remember those Aleister Crowley sex rituals

889
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
They like the

890
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
Walnut sauce

891
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
What that is

892
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
And they going to get you

893
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
You're going to like them

894
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
There's a whole lot of very legitimate

895
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,519
Critiques that you can make about the clintons work in Haiti

896
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
And it would be nice if Alex were interested in any of those but he's not

897
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,199
Most of them are difficult to understand and he likes to keep those sorts of issues to a minimum

898
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:40,319
It's just easier to yell about dumb conspiracy theories about Elites kidnapping children to drink their blood

899
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,879
Wayless work goes into that

900
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:49,279
What else is talking about with that Clinton's in Haiti case it was a case involving an organization name New Life children's Refuge

901
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
And specifically the group's founder Laura Silsby

902
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,935
On January 12th 2010 there was a gigantic earthquake in Haiti

903
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:01,311
At least 100,000 people died as a result of the quake in the number is suggested actually be much higher than that

904
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Silsbee was arrested attempted to cross the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic with 33 children many of them who were

905
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Not they were not worth it

906
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Though they were heading for a makeshift orphan

907
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
She was arrested along with nine other missionaries she was working with

908
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
But charges against them all were dropped

909
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
Only she remained in prison

910
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:25,119
Though when she received the trial the charges were dropped from kidnapping to quote arranging a regular travel

911
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
He was found guilty and released having servers that

912
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Sentence already well wait

913
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Trial

914
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
This story is an offshoot p

915
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Narrative

916
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,639
When that whole thing was getting going it was decided by internet sleuths

917
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
But this is how the clintons got kids

918
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,783
Is that they would then use to harvest adrenochrome in the blood-drinking rituals in the non-existent basement

919
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
Comet Ping Pong Pizza where we can assume there were

920
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,183
Alex is quite literally just bringing back up

921
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
And again that's the same thing with the Walnut sauce

922
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
That was another pizzagate

923
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,375
It was something the internet sleuths decided sounded

924
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,215
Weird and podesta's emails so they decided it must be code for pedophilia

925
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,775
This behavior is what you'd expect from Alex at this

926
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,591
This point he's trying to run a campaign against Hillary again

927
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,151
Like I said in the last time that involved a lot of pee

928
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:16,319
He doesn't even realize how much of the stuff he thinks has to do with her like it came from Reddit and 410

929
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Bulshit from that whole pizza

930
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
He claims he never covered but here he is

931
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
We're going on about Walnut sauce in the

932
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
Kidnapping kids out of Haiti

933
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
We can't go into reruns

934
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,703
This is lame lame I don't want to watch

935
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Virgin

936
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Another

937
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,639
I want to watch Parks and Rec all over again Danny time for something new let's move on to the good place

938
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,503
We can't be doing this for but I think it's very interesting because he doesn't have good mines around

939
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,159
And not to save the buying to get around it before work good in the end it broad Center for creative

940
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Yes

941
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,767
In the last election cycle He Had a Brain Trust of some real

942
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Will

943
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,143
F***** up people you know he was working on all cylinders yet

944
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
Larry Nichols Rodger Stone

945
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
A lot of people real bulshit

946
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
And admit

947
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
Conspiracies that really stick with

948
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
You know there is there you got to

949
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Give him some credit for having some cancer

950
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
Where's the theories that pen

951
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,951
Betrayed into the larger Consciousness and I don't think he has as good a peoples around him now or incompetent people around

952
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,327
Found him now and so what do you do well what work last time just a revert back as best you can

953
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,935
Roger's going to prison

954
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
Smuggled some notes out on some ideas

955
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
Go visit him and write it down and crayon

956
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
But the Raptors

957
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Great now.

958
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,551
I hope it gets 50 years just a 10 years or now he can f*** with

959
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
Teri Garr

960
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
Alex

961
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,183
Teases that Rodger has an announcement

962
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
I've got a message from Rodger stones

963
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
World

964
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Bite me

965
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Yes I would say when you can

966
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Lady Gaga

967
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
Rodger

968
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
I'll do that

969
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
The phone shop

970
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,503
So he teases it again and you kind of get a sense of like what could be

971
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,599
The delay says that Rodger said to make this announcement after

972
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,463
So that could be why you push back

973
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
But

974
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
Alex does not wait

975
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,655
Wait until after the verdict because when he comes back this is about three and a half hours into the show

976
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
You just do that makes the announce

977
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
World

978
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
Rodger stone that message is your basic liberties

979
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,039
Four basic freedoms

980
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Due process

981
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,879
Under attack

982
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,743
Kenny Rodger Stone can be found guilty on any of the six-count

983
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
7

984
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,607
By this Kangaroo Court in this Obama

985
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Appointed

986
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Byron

987
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
Fake judge

988
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
No one in this nation is safe

989
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
So now what you have there is editorializing

990
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
That isn't Rogers message

991
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
But Alex has set it up as Rodger

992
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
Rogers messages

993
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,551
This is a kangaroo court it's an Obama statue

994
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,415
Jury so now those sorts of messages appear to be coming from Rodger

995
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
Whatever Rodger may or may not have told him

996
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
That's what Alex is presenting

997
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Alex is narratives of

998
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,167
About the trial are now intermingled with the presentation of Alex's mess

999
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
H Rogers message throughout

1000
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
Alex Watts

1001
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,079
All of it to be Rogers message

1002
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
Whereas in Siri

1003
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
This is

1004
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
Maybe what Rodger told

1005
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
So Rodger Stones message is this

1006
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,063
He expects to be

1007
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Convicted

1008
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,439
He said only a miracle can save them now that's his exact words to me last night

1009
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
And this morning

1010
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
And he said to me Alex

1011
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Barring a miracle

1012
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Appeal

1013
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
T'god

1014
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
I appeal to your listeners for prayer

1015
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
I appeal to the president

1016
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
To Pardon Me

1017
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Because to do so would be a

1018
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Action

1019
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
That would show these corrupt chords

1020
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
But they're not going to get away

1021
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
Persecuting people for their free speech over the crime

1022
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
The president elected

1023
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
We don't do that

1024
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
It will embolden

1025
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Their Criminal

1026
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Activity

1027
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,799
Alex is delivering this I don't believe it's an actual message I think

1028
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,895
It may be some of the things are things Rodger told him if he was talking

1029
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Rodger I'm not entirely sure what

1030
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
But

1031
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,039
If Rodger didn't know Steve pieczenik Korea

1032
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Appetite

1033
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
If Alex

1034
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Did talk to Rodger

1035
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,951
I would assume he would say you don't have your audience pray for me

1036
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,279
I would like it for Trump to Pardon Me

1037
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
I could see

1038
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
If he did communicate with Rodger that being what he said

1039
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,959
But all the way that this is being presented

1040
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
It lends itself

1041
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,799
To broadening what Rogers message was

1042
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
And that's really bad

1043
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Because

1044
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
The stuff that I was talking about is about who

1045
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
That last clip not the one we just play but the one about this being the Obama stacked jury kangaroo court that is

1046
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Discussing the case

1047
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
That break

1048
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Rogers gag order

1049
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
So if Rodger said to Alex

1050
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,583
I want your audience to pray for me I appeal for Trump to Pardon Me

1051
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
That might not be considered discussing the case

1052
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
But the way Alex is talking about this and the editorializing it takes it into a place where he could f*** Rodger over

1053
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
That's why

1054
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
I kind of feel like Rodger wouldn't do that

1055
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,223
Cuz he would know that Alex would do that absolutely

1056
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,039
I don't know what's going on

1057
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Cuz Alex is going to

1058
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
He's reading it off of his hand like

1059
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,207
Rodger says hi everybody

1060
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
Text Mom

1061
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,047
Please pray for me but I mean

1062
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:24,447
Can you imagine praying for Rodger Stone immediately following

1063
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,263
The verdict I don't know I don't know why he wrote that one

1064
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,639
Unreliable narrator giving us this message so I don't know what I believe

1065
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
I'm I'm suspicious

1066
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Let's say

1067
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,319
So here's the last clip from the 14th and it's Alex discussing how like there's a plan

1068
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
If Rodgers can

1069
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,975
There's a press release an article on newswars.com and infowars.com

1070
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
That

1071
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,167
Have the number to the White House on it

1072
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,079
And even when he is convicted

1073
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
By this jury

1074
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
It is

1075
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,199

All of the country travel to d.c. anytime

1087
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
For the week after this connection

1088
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
And encircle the White House with bull horns

1089
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
Demanding President Trump

1090
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Take action

1091
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
Do you see like

1092
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
That

1093
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
It's it's

1094
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:48,415
He's trying to control the narrative is Rogers Freedom or whatever

1095
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,815
And he's using it to funnel it into like advertising for Infowars bright like a we have this press release

1096
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,167
Nobody share it we have an infograph specific infographic that obviously is going to have

1097
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,239
Infowars.com

1098
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,311
It's going to be a great floors branded bullhorn

1099
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
A promotional Blitz

1100
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,895
I do I do see a little bit of that

1101
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
But whatever

1102
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,503
It's still not outside it's not totally in the realm of like

1103
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
Over the top

1104
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,135
Alex trying to profit off of Rogers but it is controlling

1105
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
The space

1106
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
What I hear is

1107
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
His hearts

1108
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,023
He just knows

1109
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
He knows Rogers to guilty

1110
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
And he's any the same time he's like

1111
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
We got to try this

1112
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
We got to try this whole like their railroading am narrative

1113
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,919
It's a tough song People likes about Rodger stone is how I obviously criminal he was

1114
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,199
Part of his

1115
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,063
Yeah he even talks about that how I keep plays up his villainous aspect because they're fun

1116
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Please like

1117
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,951
Well yeah really should probably go to jail we just don't want him to go now

1118
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,279
It's a hard case to make those like wow

1119
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:02,911
Should have been in prison long ago yeah alright alright you got them

1120
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Show me the regular

1121
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
Praying for Rodger

1122
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,311
Lord I just we thank you for this meal

1123
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,847
I hope Rodger Stones okay

1124
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
This sneaky

1125
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
Top-hat wearing

1126
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
Villain from a old movie

1127
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
Yeah it seems weird

1128
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,343
So we jump in on the 25th and

1129
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
The 15th

1130
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:26,207
And he is the sound quality in this is

1131
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Rochas

1132
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,631
Friday November 15th 2019

1133
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:38,751
I am your host Alex Jones as I predicted for weeks

1134
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
And as I definitively said yesterday

1135
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,151
Rodger Stone would be found guilty on all counts

1136
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,711
He faces 50

1137
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,247
Years

1138
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Ladies and gentlemen

1139
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Forethought

1140
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:57,183
Crime maybe the sound isn't obviously different

1141
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Yet but

1142
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
This verse like five

1143
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,583
Minutes or so of his shell on the 15th is noticeably

1144
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,727
You're getting it he's going to prison for 50 years got to make it as a

1145
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
Beers possible

1146
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
Great first. Cry

1147
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,079
Sakura

1148
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Do you know those

1149
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
Those thought that he had work rhyme

1150
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,527
That's true even thought about committing crimes

1151
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,599
Do Alex now pretends that Rodger is going to be on

1152
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,903
Michelle later ladies and gentlemen

1153
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,951
He was completely

1154
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
And totally

1155
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,071
Railroaded there's a good shop

1156
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah they don't take me to custody the hearing is still ongoing right now that he will be on the broadcast today

1157
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,751
They let him know that if he does speak out against it

1158
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,823
The judge will throw the book at him even harder

1159
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,455
The title of a clip Alex pretends Rodger is going to be on later yeah fukin right

1160
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
Absurd to imagine

1161
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
Best he's going to call in

1162
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,159
After the sentencing until gets a number

1163
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,695
He is not talking to Alex

1164
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:06,559
At all cuz that never goes out by a day every minute he talks to house

1165
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:11,935
It's conceivable that he's right about the juror

1166
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
Situation

1167
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,007
It's important because

1168
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,591
You did that in order to have oatmeal

1169
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Away into attack

1170
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,431
The trial whenever Rodger is

1171
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
Inevitably found guilty

1172
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
There's never been a rolling like this and remember

1173
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,879
We suppose that there was a jerk officially got the name

1174
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
And

1175
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,719
Mueller probe

1176
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,303
Exposed

1177
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
The judge remove her off of

1178
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,447
Somebody's trying to fix the hissing

1179
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
Yeah that's that's great

1180
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
That's the worst

1181
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,615
It's real weird like we got the name right

1182
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,247
Yo dude has terrible impressively wrong

1183
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
So at the new

1184
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
Point now

1185
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,695
Is that if Rodger goes to prison he's going to be murdered in prison right like episode

1186
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
That is the new angle

1187
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
And Alex Express is that

1188
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
This is a tyranny and it'll warm up for President Trump and President Trump hasn't gotten the sun's out of jail he could when he told

1189
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,495
Massage release the Wikileaks that's a big black mark on the present

1190
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,055
Pardon Rodger Stone

1191
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
Well then I'm and I got to tell you

1192
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
No matter how many good things Trump does

1193
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,015
Doing the Tucson gem and letting Stone Hangout

1194
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
He does this

1195
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,343
I just don't know what I'm going to do

1196
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,391
When you call the White House right now

1197
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,439
20-24

1198
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,255
5614 14

1199
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
Until President Trump depart

1200
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Him

1201
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:47,679
Don't let them get their hands on him they'll put him in solitary confinement God knows what to do with food

1202
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,239
These people mean by last night

1203
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Killing

1204
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:57,919
We hear their first indication of Alex being like if he doesn't pardon Stone

1205
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,271
Not going to be put in solitary confinement

1206
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,831
Who cares

1207
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:11,231
Against that cares I mean who cares about that stuff because that's secondary to me

1208
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,279
Then Alex's

1209
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
Point vet if Trump doesn't pardon

1210
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
I don't know what about

1211
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,679
I don't care about all the good stuff he's doing

1212
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
He's leaving

1213
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
Assange

1214
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
And Rodger Stone out to dry like

1215
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
I don't I can't

1216
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
Because I think it would Alex is starting to realize

1217
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,015
Is that he will also be left out to dry along with literally everyone you stupid f******

1218
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,087
Moron

1219
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Alex is starting

1220
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
He started to realize that there is no honor among Thieves

1221
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:49,119
There is no protection from her for him

1222
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:54,239
Man he will be tossed aside as easily as these other people are

1223
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
Guys have never read

1224
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
A f****** book

1225
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,151
All the Lord of the Rings series is about

1226
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:06,271
Tilex side now you saying that Roger's not only facing 50 years in prison

1227
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,855
He's facing maybe 100 making a prediction here

1228
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
I'm actually

1229
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
The seven charges

1230
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:18,303
And the judge I believe could twist it she may give him more than 50

1231
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:26,495
Because he's monsters want you to know they'll put you in prison if you stand up for America he is a modern thought Criminal

1232
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
Who has done nothing

1233
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
Come on and Trump told Julian Assange

1234
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
Release the Wikileaks he did

1235
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
Nicole

1236
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
I like Trump

1237
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,575
Way more than Hillary

1238
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
Is a lot of good things but I got

1239
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,487
I don't know what I'm going to do

1240
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
If Trump doesn't

1241
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Pardon Stone

1242
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Is 40

1243
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
Plus your wingman

1244
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,959
He's got a date of the same women

1245
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Whole Nine Yards

1246
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,455
They fix the hissing Trump policy is penchant

1247
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,807
Brian people have to drive that got him elected

1248
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
I don't know

1249
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
What I'm going to do

1250
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
I don't know.

1251
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,767
I think he's facing a moment of like

1252
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
I can

1253
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
This is this is the good

1254
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
Chance Yep this is how I can get out of

1255
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,959
This is how everything can change

1256
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,519
I can I can

1257
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Retain

1258
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,847
All of my narratives about Trump

1259
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,663
About how he was doing all these good things

1260
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
I can retain

1261
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
You can retain everything

1262
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
He doesn't have to turn on Trump

1263
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
He doesn't really even have to

1264
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:49,439
You can just say it like yeah you know what everything that we saw that was good in him was good

1265
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
We were right to do that

1266
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,303
Trump is just he's not strong enough to stand up to the swamp

1267
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
The Deep state is too powerful

1268
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
He can

1269
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,191
You can wreck on a whole bunch of stuff

1270
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
8 something

1271
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
The audience will probably see is acceptable

1272
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
He won't stand up for Julian Assange and Rodger Stone I realize that there is a real problem with

1273
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,479
The best I can

1274
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
I could stop supporting

1275
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
Or I can pivot

1276
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
Whatever this is

1277
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Perfect opportunity for him I think he's

1278
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
Yeah I see the light

1279
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,231
Window well I mean just

1280
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
Very obvious

1281
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,535
Verbal pattern

1282
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,607
I'm not trying to brag and then he brag

1283
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
If you saying I'm not saying I'm in a cult

1284
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
And then he changes in your life

1285
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Oh man

1286
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:40,895
Your word get it I don't know if you get it in your head but your subconscious is like I'm Sentosa

1287
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
Buckeye got the

1288
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,271
It's a Nigerian email Tim over

1289
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
Yep it is big a big picture

1290
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
The Rodger did nothing wrong

1291
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
The damn thing

1292
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,327
And these monsters

1293
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,911
We're going to use is a beta test with their jurisdictions

1294
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,471
To go after everybody's got to put them in prison

1295
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
I live in Travis County

1296
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,967
It's so funny to remember that Alex has big documentary endgame

1297
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:22,367
Literally ends with a shot of Alex bullhorn Rick Perry's House late at night accusing him of being a globalist

1298
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:28,767
And all they did was trying to get him arrested for something they made up his Mane documentary that he says

1299
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Who's all his claims

1300
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,351
Leave the viewer with a shot of him attacking Rick Perry

1301
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
But now the Perry isn't with Trump used good upstanding American wants what's best for the country so spineless

1302
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,919
As for the case of Alex is talking about this is what we talked about on a recent 2013 episode where Rick Perry

1303
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:51,039
He was trying to force a Democrat ba out-of-office by defunding her office if she refused to resign

1304
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
Which is not cool

1305
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:56,159
He was indicted for that but the charges were dropped after he appealed when he was out of office

1306
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
That's that that's

1307
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Okay.

1308
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,047
Talking crazy

1309
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Fine just go away

1310
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Sure

1311
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
So that's nonsense

1312
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,703
Whatever

1313
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,031
To try to use those as examples of

1314
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
Like this

1315
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
No

1316
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
Anyway you shouldn't like Rick Perry why do you like

1317
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:24,319
New process should be abandoned in this country.

1318
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,903
About due process and I don't know why I'm mad but I'm mad about both

1319
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
So Alex like I said I think he's starting to realize that Trump is a disloyal bad actor

1320
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Go stupid

1321
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
And President Trump

1322
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Adopted up for the rocket

1323
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,471
Independent president organized

1324
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,543
Coming after you the members of Congress and walking

1325
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,895
And I Know It Feels Right to sale Trump's wonderful and you know

1326
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Everything I do against him

1327
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,319
What about us what about the president protecting the American people

1328
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,135
Are they going to come indict me have another rigged jury

1329
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,487
Plays golf and talks about how he's a

1330
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Stable genius

1331
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,887
You remember what happened that night we all find a clip

1332
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,423
2 a.m.

1333
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Collapse

1334
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:24,735
You better get ready

1335
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,783
Achilles

1336
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
Guard yourself for true

1337
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
Mayweather

1338
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,303
Guard yourself for True another

1339
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,423
I don't know what that music is but they play it

1340
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
A bunch episode

1341
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:49,567
And I all I can make out from the lyrics as you keep coming back for more

1342
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,359
Which also seems almost

1343
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
Steamatic

1344
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
I don't know what store

1345
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,199
Is it what

1346
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,295
The people that work for him still don't know how to run his sound

1347
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
Still

1348
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,927
I don't know

1349
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:11,327
Somebody choosing the music who is clearly f****** with him from time to time plenty of evidence of them

1350
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,727
Very on-the-nose what makes they play that Depeche Mode song like you had something to hide

1351
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:23,103
While he was introducing the up the Rodger announcement

1352
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:30,271
Yeah there it seems like there's weird but how much of that is over analysis

1353
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,599
I'll get plays over and over

1354
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
In-N-Out of brakes

1355
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:40,511
To the point where it's very noticeable like I've ever heard and episode where he's played something more than

1356
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Twice

1357
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:45,119
I can sometimes happen every now and again

1358
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
But that

1359
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
Themes

1360
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
So

1361
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
On the nose and weird

1362
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
Totally see one of those people like accidentally deleting the Spotify problems

1363
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,687
Stupid industrial opportunities

1364
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
Conclusion is notable infected

1365
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,879
I'm so Alex is mad because Trump is

1366
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
Sweden but he doesn't want tweets

1367
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,231
Rodger Stone got Trump elected

1368
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,047
Blisters of the show got Trump elected

1369
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Matt Drudge

1370
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,351
Got Trump elected

1371
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
The truth

1372
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
You guys are doing great

1373
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,519
Like I said on your stay

1374
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
Show

1375
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
I said

1376
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,663
We don't need tweet from President Trump about this we need action

1377
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,807
Tweet from President Trump saying this is a miscarriage of justice and then and then nothing

1378
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
We need

1379
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
Action

1380
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
Now

1381
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,047
Ebenezer the b******* the trumps feeding

1382
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
He's realizing

1383
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
I'm not safe

1384
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Noah

1385
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,215
None of our allies in this propaganda game that we've been running

1386
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,031
For the explicit purpose of Defending Trump

1387
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
None of us matter

1388
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,895
None of us like no one's going to be there like hey

1389
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
Split Blast 3

1390
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,735
4 years of my f****** life

1391
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,039
Going out of my way to carry water

1392
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
For this f****** a******

1393
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Abandoning

1394
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,695
Everything that I knew except white supremacist was allowing

1395
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,999
Mike cernovich on my show

1396
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
You understand

1397
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
Purpose

1398
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,399
It's crazy and I like now there isn't anything

1399
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
What you get for it

1400
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
You will be

1401
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
You will be sacrificed

1402
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
If it is

1403
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
Necessary I don't know what it's like to have a kid but that moment I imagine of you having told this child

1404
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,967
Over and over and over again the same thing

1405
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,295
And then never learning and then eventually them coming up to you and being like

1406
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
You know

1407
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,391
I realize that this guy really

1408
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,439
Doesn't like me it isn't paying attention

1409
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,839
Anime and thinking that that's something that they're coming to on their own when you're like I've been screaming that at you

1410
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,399
For years you get it

1411
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,447
So at this point Rodger actually

1412
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Hasn't been

1413
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,263
Convicted yet but Alex is acting as if

1414
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,895
Write this is still like at the jury deliberation but it's like we all kind of weld

1415
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
Which is interesting because if I hadn't told you that you would have thought that he got convicted before the show

1416
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Yeah he did okay

1417
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,391
So Alex sucks now about the last time that he talked

1418
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,207
Did the pardoning you pardoned Arpaio we got the

1419
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
Yeah, I got to talk to Trump

1420
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
Naviga

1421
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,543
I'm like listen you know they're putting the sheriff in prison

1422
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:37,151
That woman's got a trial to know know the judge is doing it what judge can't do that

1423
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,687
Yes mr. president

1424
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
We need you to

1425
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,623
Pardoned him they're coming after because he released documents showing you were being spied on they got from the DEA we released the original in it

1426
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,927
How do you know about that

1427
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,743
Telling you about a year ago

1428
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,351
I don't need you to tell me how great I am

1429
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,655
They take you out there going to get me next

1430
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
I need you to go after him

1431
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,751
Do things about that last clip 1

1432
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:06,079
If that is true which I'm almost certain

1433
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,407
It's not then if I were drop I wouldn't talk to Alex again either

1434
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,199
That retelling is clearly an inch

1435
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:17,087
Expensive Alex line to the president in order to get a racist authoritarian part for crimes he was absolutely guilty of

1436
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,671
The documents Alex had were from Dennis Montgomery

1437
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,511
We didn't entire episode about that b******* titled the dentist Montgomery invest

1438
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
You can go and listen to that if you want to

1439
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Standard Foley

1440
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:31,935
None of these documents were real none of them proved Trump was being spied on and none of them were from the D

1441
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
DEA

1442
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,775
Why would the drug enforcement agency be involved in any of

1443
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,591
I'd be a good dead giveaway that Alex is just kind of make me

1444
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
3

1445
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,967
The reason that Arpaio was going to prison with contempt of court that is true

1446
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
But that doesn't really get to the heart of the matter

1447
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
Arpaio been the subjective

1448
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,343
Very thorough investigation

1449
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:54,207
And it was found in his police department in Maricopa County operated ways that violated City

1450
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
The rights

1451
01:10:55,487 --> 01:11:00,351
Is Department of the flagrant pattern of racial profiling that quote reached the highest levels of the agent

1452
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,215
And it was so severe that the department was stripped of its ability to legally identifier

1453
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
Detain suspected undocumented

1454
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
That's how bad their patterns

1455
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
Again I'm against

1456
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,175
Shorter prison sentences

1457
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
Arpaio's the only person that I can

1458
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,575
Think of right off the top of my head that I want to rot in jail go to The Hague

1459
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
He should rot in jail for the rest

1460
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,183
Do too many lawsuits involving his inhuman treatment of

1461
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,999
Detainees the court told Arpaio that changes had to be

1462
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
His Department

1463
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,839
Arpaio refuse to do with the courts that he had to do

1464
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
He was given many warning

1465
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,911
Bennie January 2015

1466
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,519
Years after he had every reason to understand that the way he did business violated civil rights

1467
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
You held in contempt

1468
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
Discord

1469
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:45,407
The case went on until July 2017 at which point he was found guilty of

1470
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,687
Criminal contempt

1471
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,247
But that charge is not just some minor chart

1472
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:54,879
That guilty charge is a front-facing mask that's covering of yours of racist and abusive police

1473
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,439
Practices that Ohio refused to change

1474
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,023
I know it goes without saying but the contempt of court charge means nothing

1475
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,327
The reason Arpaio got a pardon

1476
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
From drop the reason that Alex fought so hard to

1477
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
Protective was the racist abusive

1478
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Police in the characterized as

1479
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Career

1480
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,031
When they defend Arpaio that's what they're defending

1481
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,615
Not some kind of bulshit a judge can send you to jail nonsense

1482
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
You don't need a jury to hold someone in contempt

1483
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,223
The court because of jury already decided the case

1484
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
That contempt is based on

1485
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,783
Alex knost

1486
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,183
You just doesn't care cuz he needs to make his white identity believes look like a defensive rule of law in order to make it marketable to Allah

1487
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Larger audience

1488
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
All that's going on here

1489
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
F*** this

1490
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
Pakistan said another bad exam

1491
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
For him to tie

1492
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
B Rodger

1493
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
Now

1494
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Get to the point where I live

1495
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
Rodger his

1496
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:47,871
10 a.m.

1497
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,199
Baseball cap

1498
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,783
1776

1499
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Four-door

1500
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,879
Maybe 1776

1501
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
How many 76ers on the front

1502
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Wow

1503
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,511
Guide

1504
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,559
The Revolutionary War

1505
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Thought

1506
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,239
When they connect still today probably when I'm on are I'm going to wear

1507
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
76

1508
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
Hey I left it in my

1509
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,623
They walked in and handed to me they got Rodger Stone can

1510
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
That's not some psychic event

1511
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:40,095
That's like watching somebody in a bullfight get run over by the bull and the Bull's horn go right

1512
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,239
So that seems like a plug for his hat

1513
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Atwoods

1514
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
More

1515
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Hat Pinterest

1516
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,103
Then Rodger Stone news.

1517
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,151
I was worried about the Hat

1518
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,991
The long journey and took together

1519
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,551
It took us a while to get there

1520
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,623
Yeah followed by and see I'm not psychic

1521
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,671
Obviously

1522
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,255
I think we all knew that

1523
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
Be found guilty

1524
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:14,655
Something that I think is going on here is that Alex recognizes that

1525
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:21,055
Almost everybody hears the news Rodger Stone has been found guilty is immediately going to go to Infowars

1526
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,847
Immediately

1527
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,895
I was going to freak out

1528
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:31,295
Like I heard from people who was dark shadows like I've never listen to his show live I had to go immediately to

1529
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:35,903
Watch this

1530
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,207
Antique booster naughty I would be from

1531
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,767
Answer why not use that as an opportunity like

1532
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,423
Tell these great hats to wear this when Rodger was found guilty in order of the Revolutionary War

1533
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
The great hats

1534
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,983
Well made

1535
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,055
1999 1776

1536
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,335
You get a discount

1537
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Yep

1538
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,431
So Alex now has a situation where all eyes are

1539
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
His show

1540
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
He's probably

1541
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
He's probably at least somewhat aware of

1542
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,343
Yeah it's hard to tell how much exact

1543
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
He considered self-immolated

1544
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,719
He knew that enough people were watching that I could have really done

1545
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,511
I don't think that's the

1546
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,071
He's already said that Rodger might be

1547
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,375
But he knows that that's not true

1548
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,655
But he does have

1549
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,679
Some gas

1550
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,799
Barnes

1551
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,383
Very exciting things to just travel the big National sovereignty day

1552
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
Is he will now

1553
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
When I get to that

1554
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Next segment.

1555
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
Responded

1556
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,879
Starbucks

1557
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,671
Michael's who is the concert McClendon

1558
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
He's got big and tell on Adam

1559
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,255
Chef and

1560
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Ed buck

1561
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,327
And the Satanic rituals that went on there

1562
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
Holyshit Larry Nichols is back

1563
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,471
Larry Nichols is on the show Mary Nichols is back

1564
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,263
He's had cancer for

1565
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,799
45 years now

1566
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
Husband

1567
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
5 years

1568
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
John

1569
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,783
But I think you're free

1570
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Near me

1571
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,975
I don't know what the cases with that I don't want to I don't want to sit here in Bach what may or may not

1572
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
Not be legitimate

1573
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Illness

1574
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,351
I don't know what the deal is with that and I don't like

1575
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,935
I think there's so many other things you can talk about with Larry that's

1576
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
So far past what I'm even in

1577
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
Interested in

1578
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
He's back

1579
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:33,151
I mean just the day before on the show he started recording on bulshit

1580
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,711
True pundit articles that are based on Larry's

1581
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
Reportaj

1582
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,575
Get Larry back in here

1583
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,647
Reach out or did somebody did somebody from

1584
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,439
True pundit

1585
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,719
I got some b******* I need

1586
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,511
I got to check with Larry

1587
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,911
Or is Larry like sending out texts from time to time I know exactly how this works

1588
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,703
It's much less confusing

1589
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Like I said

1590
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
Get the sense

1591
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
That Alex recognize

1592
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
As if there's more people listening

1593
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,479
Because instead of covering Rogers s*** in detail

1594
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,759
Here's what he does

1595
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,551
Going to 2020 or so much happening

1596
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,647
We're here is your word-of-mouth getting around the sensors which is

1597
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,695
And buying products

1598
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,511
So I was going to before polymer came on

1599
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,071
Talk about DNA Force Plus

1600
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
Chicken stock

1601
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
Co Q10 and the pqq Atmore

1602
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
Barfly

1603
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,335
The product whatever we talk about properly

1604
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,431
Now this all happened so I'm not going to have time to get to it now

1605
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
Oh no search

1606
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,039
Just this morning

1607
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
But I printed off

1608
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
Mainline science

1609
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,159
Nobel prizes

1610
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
210 and

1611
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
I think you're cute

1612
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,863
Notice again he's using the Trope of the older guy got the full. I got a binder full of women that's

1613
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
This is a long

1614
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,983
But I wanted to play this just so you can hear the

1615
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,775
Mundane

1616
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,567
Banality of it

1617
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,407
This is the same segment of his Show when he announced Rodger got found

1618
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,295
Regrows mitochondria in the brain cells that nothing else

1619
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,303
Alzheimer's everything they will not tell you about this

1620
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
All here

1621
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,911
50% off it's the one thing

1622
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
Body should give themselves

1623
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
Anybody about 40 should be on

1624
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,663
The Pikachu the calcium channel minutes got all of the other things

1625
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,455
That was the Fountain of Youth by the

1626
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,991
Japanese reishi mushroom

1627
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
Astragalus root

1628
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,063
The Dragula

1629
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:54,207
G a lot of stuff in there huh

1630
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,655
The 40-50 $60 in Orange drawing or aren't from organic Source like these

1631
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Think about that

1632
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
Okay

1633
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
I'm thinking

1634
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,055
Similar formula

1635
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,615
Not a prescription by the doctors

1636
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,431
So if you going to jail Danner

1637
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,343
How long does it take delivery

1638
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,975
Because it cost so much racket lawyer have a statement

1639
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
Product

1640
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,559
And something will you not sell it for 203

1641
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,399
Marketing Barnes Road

1642
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:43,103
Contract on this we're still going

1643
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,175
Discounted right now

1644
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Nobody gives you this

1645
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,735
Prophetess quality

1646
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,039
7498 right

1647
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
The product

1648
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Attitash

1649
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,231
And if you're really the older.

1650
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
Issues take a lot of

1651
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:04,607
What happens what what happened

1652
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,911
Hungry

1653
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
Doesn't grow longer

1654
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
Nope

1655
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
This is insane

1656
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,464
Like that was a long clip yeah as long as it is show he dedicated to talking about

1657
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,048
Is DNA force in a in an infomercial way

1658
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,608
In the time when

1659
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,192
You would be most likely to have the most eyes on his show

1660
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,240
If I were looking at this cynically

1661
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,312
I would say that's an intentional decision now

1662
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:55,296
He just got through Rogers going to prison you got found guilty

1663
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
You say

1664
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,464
Going to prison

1665
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,000
Speaking a little bit

1666
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
Presumptuously

1667
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,840
All signs appear that you probably going to prison

1668
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:14,240
And Alex's first responses to talk about this great hat he decided to wear whenever Rodger it's a really good head

1669
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:19,872
DNA Forest it's f****** weird

1670
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
Also

1671
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:25,760
He's got a tie-in with Disney plus it's a whole cool thing but he does he's not going to announce that just

1672
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:32,160
Strategically it seems like hey we have the audience that we are unable to capture in any other way

1673
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:38,560
Let's see if we can move some of this stuff

1674
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Yeah it seems like that

1675
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
Can I get Paul Joseph Watson

1676
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:50,592
Who you mentioned went to that Independence March in Polish

1677
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
About within the con

1678
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,152
Text Stefan molyneux

1679
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,688
Right

1680
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Interesting because the

1681
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,760
The misconception

1682
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,576
I suppose around that and granted I haven't looked into

1683
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,904
All the Dynamics of this year's March

1684
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,928
As it related to

1685
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Fun

1686
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,488
He was going to whitewash

1687
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
Watch that because the year prior

1688
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,864
There had been a bunch of people with Nazi signs and

1689
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:18,496
And that was outlawed do you want to be sanitized version in order to create the appearance

1690
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,336
Your priors Bart

1691
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,640
Was all bulshit in the last being out of control

1692
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
I don't know what this year

1693
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,736
Is Buzz I don't know if Paul's doing there

1694
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,808
If he wants to just go to a Polish Independence Day Parade

1695
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,880
Care but I do see it as signal

1696
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,928
You know eyesight because of

1697
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
Stephon going

1698
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:42,048
And making a big deal of endorsing white nationalism after going

1699
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
Poland

1700
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,888
It has become a bit of a thing in this community

1701
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,168
So

1702
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
See that is kind of a

1703
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,240
Tip of the Hat

1704
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
There's no way that you could

1705
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,592
And I'm not saying that

1706
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,176
I'm not saying that nobody could want to just go

1707
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,200
To the Polish

1708
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
National Independence Day

1709
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
I will probably be fun

1710
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:06,112
Better yet know it's very cool is I've never even been to Poland I'd love to

1711
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,696
To see all those things at anytime you're at a

1712
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
That's very cool but Paul Joseph Watson does not just go to the pollinator in England

1713
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
It's not just go to the f******

1714
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:24,032
I agree with you but I also slightly disagree I don't I don't know I would say going not a big deal

1715
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:28,384
Talking about it and being like a everybody says it's a racist parade

1716
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
That's kind of like okay you're doing that a

1717
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,992
That part's a hundred percent

1718
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,088
I don't know I don't really care though I really can't I should stress I

1719
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,952
Not kept up at unlike I don't know exactly what's going on now with the Dynamics are

1720
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,256
So I'm probably not in the best place

1721
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,536
Think about it but

1722
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Paula Zahn

1723
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
And

1724
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
He does not see

1725
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,168
Very optimistic about Rogers Prospect

1726
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
Will we see

1727
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
This is

1728
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:09,088
They're saying we shouldn't criticize Trump into man what he said he would do

1729
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
Trump

1730
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
We got Trump elected dammit

1731
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:18,304
Friend

1732
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,704
I want him part now

1733
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,800
What song is back man

1734
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:33,664
Paul does not seem like he has any faith that Trump is going to do anything and Alex

1735
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
Nah

1736
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
Man

1737
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Paulding

1738
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,928
I did know that

1739
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,000
The only one here is like

1740
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:54,656
I know that I know what the score is I know what I'm doing

1741
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:58,496
Bring the little bit the done videos that have come out where he talks about life

1742
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
I'm not into conspiracy theories present himself as being Above This.

1743
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,176
And to an extent

1744
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,992
Like he's been far more willing to criticize Trump than Alex and

1745
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
The past

1746
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,808
He's had a sale on Facebook

1747
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
Whatever whatever

1748
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
Deanza

1749
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,672
A little bit more of a like

1750
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,720
A position to say like

1751
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,048
Come on Alex than anybody else

1752
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
But I still think

1753
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,656
It's weird to say he didn't get do

1754
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:33,056
Because you probably did somewhat but just not nearly as bad

1755
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,080
Therapy

1756
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
He kept Scott

1757
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,992
I just mean like on a general

1758
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,880
I would look at it as somebody who diversify their portfolio as opposed to someone who's all in on one stock

1759
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,184
I think you put a little bit of like

1760
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Some of his

1761
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,744
Steaks elsewhere

1762
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,352
And because he's so singularly focused on culture War

1763
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,120
Nonsense

1764
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:01,472
It doesn't matter too much about Trump for him

1765
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Sanity of the

1766
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,008
Left

1767
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:08,128
And all that it's it's still plays

1768
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,176
For even

1769
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
Far

1770
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
More

1771
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
Artificial issues

1772
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,368
Someone yelling on a campus so War on Christmas begins earlier

1773
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Yeah

1774
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
So

1775
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,952
Alex is seems

1776
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
Stuff during the breaks

1777
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,280
Apparently of people on

1778
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,840
MSNBC making jokes about how

1779
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:33,984
Rodger has a tattoo of Nixon Nixon's finally going to prison

1780
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,032
That's on Rodger

1781
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
That's his fault

1782
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
Alex is

1783
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:45,504
Yuri yes so you have to take those you have the pictures

1784
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,112
Willie commands in physical 1776

1785
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:55,488
From Summit. News here it is Gateway pundit. Commerce video

1786
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,144
Set up his impeachment inquiry as we look live inside the news

1787
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:11,872
Google

1788
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:24,416
If it's not that one

1789
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:30,816
He is mad mad

1790
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,168
Hey your bet you one of your best friends is going to jail I get

1791
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
Not wanting other people to laugh at

1792
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:42,592
Yeah they're making fun of

1793
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,384
In

1794
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,920
That is this a great

1795
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
Political

1796
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
Anyway

1797
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,088
So on are on the last episode

1798
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,392
Ye did that real muddy

1799
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:59,488
Reading of Rogers message if you wanted him to deliver

1800
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Now

1801
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,304
That the verdict has happened

1802
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:06,400
Alex gets a text allegedly Aram Rogers lawyer

1803
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
And

1804
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,216
This is one of the more ironic

1805
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,496
Clips that I've ever heard

1806
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:13,312
Let me hear show people the type of stuff I've got

1807
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
The phone number of

1808
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,616
My name on this

1809
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,456
This is the type of stuff

1810
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:20,992
That I get

1811
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:30,208
Almost got Rodger taken into custody immediately upon the verdicts

1812
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
Please be cautious about your comments

1813
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,376
Lawyers

1814
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,168
Think about this

1815
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,728
Everybody

1816
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:48,128
Nobama officials

1817
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,088
So what's going on here is that

1818
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:00,928
The way that Alex behaves on the November 14th show

1819
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:06,048
Could be argued to indicate that Rodger had broken his gag order

1820
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,864
So that is what the prosecution

1821
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,632
Was saying

1822
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
Terms of holding him

1823
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,192
Right after the verdict

1824
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,472
Which side

1825
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,240
The judge didn't

1826
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:18,592
Decide to go along with but did continue with gag order

1827
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Which makes sense

1828
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
But

1829
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,456
What I find amazing

1830
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,224
Think about that

1831
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,504
Is it this lawyer

1832
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,040
Contacting Alex

1833
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Apparently

1834
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
Google knows he's making this up

1835
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,136
I don't know if he's making it up because

1836
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,464
The framing the freezing of it is so like what someone would say

1837
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
Telling him

1838
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,584
Be careful about what you say about private communication

1839
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,400
Repeating this private communication

1840
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,496
Female I think I buy it

1841
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
Just because

1842
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,384
Of that line actually just because the liner is not

1843
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,152
Hey

1844
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,712
Shut the fuk up or

1845
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:01,856
You got to be quiet about this there's too many powerful people looking it doesn't work well enough for what Alex's narrative is

1846
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,648
Please please don't

1847
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,928
Reveal too much information

1848
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,208
Yeah

1849
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,232
Man

1850
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,512
What a f******

1851
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Yep

1852
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:15,424
So the funny thing about that though is that this is him not being able to understand it

1853
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:19,520
Like that's that's really interesting if that is genuine

1854
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,592
Then he's even turning a genuine

1855
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
Ostensible allies

1856
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:27,712
His words into the conspiracy theory reality

1857
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,784
As opposed to that Rodger Stones lawyer being like

1858
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Hey

1859
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,880
Be nice to your friend you don't want to go to jail right away

1860
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,184
You know yeah

1861
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
Conspiracy theory

1862
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,232
Yeah

1863
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
So at this point Paul

1864
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,888
Offended that Rodger is going to get 50 years in prison

1865
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
For this

1866
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
And then Alex

1867
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,848
Normally people would get about six months prison time for this but Rodger Stone

1868
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:01,760
Diaz which is basically a death sentence

1869
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Okay

1870
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:20,192
All right so the most serious charge that Rodger was convicted of his witness tampering which is the result of him trying to threaten

1871
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,752
Intimidate Randy credico into pleading the fifth

1872
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:27,104
Generally speaking people don't tamper with Witnesses unless they know they're guilty

1873
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,224
And looking for a way to subvert justice so I think it's appropriate for courts to take it pretty seriously

1874
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,784
I tell a whenever I tamper with Witnesses

1875
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:41,184
Cuz I'm like tell them I am guilty sometimes people only get 6

1876
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,048
Months in prison for witness tampering that's fair a lot of it has to do with the context of the underlying

1877
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
Crime

1878
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:51,424
Princeton stead clout was a GOP member of the South Dakota House of Representative

1879
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:54,496
In 2007 he was arrested for sexually abusing a

1880
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
Is foster daughter

1881
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
Among other charges

1882
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,920
I ended up getting a pretty steep sentence but in addition he got 10 years added for attempting to

1883
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,456
To tamper with witness testimony

1884
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,504
That's a super serious offense

1885
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,320
To tamper with Witnesses in that case is he deal

1886
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:13,184
In contrast there was a case in 2015 or a husband and wife got sick at 6 months

1887
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
Witness tampering

1888
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,000
What do surrounding a drug arrest

1889
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,328
Read the tampering was still serious and be the consequence

1890
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
It was not merely a series

1891
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,168
As a former state representative abusing Foster

1892
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
For children

1893
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
Deals with the witness

1894
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,544
Tampering on a sliding scale

1895
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Hey don't say I had weed

1896
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
6 MI

1897
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,640
Hey don't say I

1898
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:36,736
Rota f****** hell you there

1899
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,552
I think he was trying to subvert a federal investigation

1900
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:45,440
How to make all the arguments he wants about a Rodger did nothing wrong and all that but if that really were the case I don't

1901
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,000
Vicki will be trying so hard to get credit code to stay silent

1902
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,328
Rodger did that for a reason and the only plausible explanation

1903
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
Come to buy

1904
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:55,680
Is that he felt that Randy credico talking would be bad for him

1905
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,472
So I don't know

1906
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:01,312
The six-month thing yeah I mean it's technically fair but that is also just

1907
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
Intentionally obtuse

1908
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,432
About what the way these charges are added

1909
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,736
Whatever

1910
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:12,576
And that's the most series on that's the one that I carry the possibility of 20 years

1911
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
As I understand

1912
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,136
Not going to get all that time

1913
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,416
Nonsense

1914
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
It's a

1915
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,488
You know it's it's

1916
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,536
It's cliche

1917
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,560
To point this out

1918
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
But

1919
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:29,728
You can f****** steal it election and you're only going to wind up getting a few years

1920
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
Stealing an election is such a vague

1921
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,152
There's a lot of you know whatever

1922
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
They go to the Dakota

1923
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Alex Freeman

1924
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
Freedom or death

1925
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Whatever

1926
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
They come back from break

1927
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
And Alex is on the phone

1928
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,392
Paul Joseph Watson tries to cover

1929
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
In common

1930
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,464
Do some stuff

1931
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,000
But then Alex

1932
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
Jumps in

1933
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
And tries to reset wow Paul

1934
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,632
Is trying to

1935
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,936
Reset himself it's very strange

1936
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:06,336
He just jumps in his like shut the f****** all I got something to say not really trying to reset so he could throw it to Paul

1937
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,640
Even though Paul is already talkin Kaiser while

1938
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
Very strange

1939
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,552
We live and we'll talk about what happened in Poland while Alex Jones makes a very important phone call going to get back

1940
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,368
Breaking Rajasthan news

1941

40 facing all 7 channels totally rigged

1945

Has Paul just got back

Eastern and Central Europe

1947
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,616
Alright you can hear almost even a little laugh Falls

1948
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,640
Alright

1949
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:19,040
Whatever this is that indicate like that behavior also runs in line with me thinking that he's become

1950
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,832
Coming aware that he has a big audience

1951
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,160
You said the drudges top link to as we appreciate it

1952
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,696
He comes in because

1953
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:28,000
He's like okay people are tuning in expect

1954
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Fantasy Alex

1955
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,376
Paul is coming in from commercial

1956
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:36,960
Establish my present be back in a few here tall do squats

1957
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,776
Tell you all about these European problem

1958
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
Yep

1959
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,128
So Paul gets to talking about violence around Europe

1960
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
Ladies migrants

1961
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,944
And I don't really care it's all

1962
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
Go to the same stuff you always

1963
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:55,904
Prado's Auto by refugees show up.

1964
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
He's citing the professor here

1965
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,768
Who's talking about violence and sweet

1966
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,584
Right listen to the weight

1967
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,632
This professor because

1968
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
Infowars

1969
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,240
The Swedish state

1970
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
Itself

1971
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,544
Is in Japanese

1972
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:17,152
He said the state's Monopoly on violence

1973
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,480
So wait hold on

1974
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,088
The Monopoly on violence is the token of a sovereign state

1975
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:30,464
Because I thought that Alex hates the idea of the Monopoly of violence being in the hands of the

1976
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,512
The state I thought that he thinks that that's a

1977
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,536
Sign of tyranny

1978
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
I'm going to need

1979
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Okay

1980
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,960
The larger context of this is that

1981
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,496
There are like a people

1982
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,056
Committing crimes in Sweden to the to the

1983
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,384
Extent that these Monopoly on the ability to

1984
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,176
Violence and Power

1985
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,712
Is taken away from the sky

1986
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,552
Which is what Alex think what you think is good

1987
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:59,648
I mean not necessarily migrant people committing crimes or whatever

1988
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
The narrative

1989
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,952
Is here but Alex

1990
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,512
Is strongly opposed

1991
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
Do a Power Monopoly being in the hands

1992
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
Devastate

1993
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,888
That is something he talks about all the time

1994
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
Yeah

1995
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:17,056
Talk about that being the enemy of sovereignty as opposed to Paul is saying that it is a Bedrock of Saw

1996
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,104
Sovereign

1997
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:25,760
It's counter to the stated editorial position of Infowars yet doesn't make any sense for him to say

1998
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,832
What he does because he wants to make you more scared of Michael

1999
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,856
No I guess

2000
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
I mean I get that but

2001
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
He wrote that down

2002
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:40,352
Right because it's something that you folks an image of these migrants being overwhelmed

2003
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:43,424
The police and taking a ride

2004
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Lichen

2005
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:48,288
The framing of it is your right 100% counter

2006
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,592
Crazy

2007
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,872
Well I mean

2008
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,920
Potential your contacts is

2009
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,224
All of these hordes of non-sweet

2010
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,992
Right

2011
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,040
Are coming in and taking over Sweden

2012
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:04,672
So he's really really catching it as like a nationalistic like all these not

2013
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:09,536
White people are being taken over by black people and white people need to have control over all the fours

2014
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,584
As relates to white population

2015
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,632
There should be no power Monopoly of the state

2016
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,424
I have two non-white population

2017
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,216
The state must have a monopoly of power

2018
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
Yes so long as the state is white

2019
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
Yes yeah

2020
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,152
Seems to be what that the confusion

2021
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,944
Anyway Alex comes back

2022
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,992
He seems like he's really mad

2023
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
At the Trump isn't helping

2024
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,808
And a lot of folks

2025
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,368
Support

2026
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
Or others

2027
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,168
Everybody else

2028
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Add

2029
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,592
Power is in the right to do it

2030
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
My back's broken

2031
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,760
Being eaten alive in a pit

2032
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
Trump's up there

2033
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
Not getting me out

2034
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,672
He won't do anything

2035
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,584
My back is broken I'm going to pit I'm dying Trump has all the power in the world did it solve this problem and he won't

2036
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Do it

2037
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,144
Start to get real pissed off you can see

2038
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,496
So Alex Rodger

2039
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Is found guilty

2040
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,104
Put spent days on in the past

2041
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,896
Now there's

2042
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:32,736
And we bring up such huge news here all the time

2043
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,624
It all just trying to get lost in its intention to get broken up

2044
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,928
Coming down the pike

2045
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
YouTube

2046
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
20 years ago

2047
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,120
The store

2048
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,728
Confirmed object of what went on in court today

2049
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,520
Should terrify

2050
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,568
Everyone in America and the world

2051
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:00,640
We don't get control of our government and our judiciary

2052
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,432
Legislative very quickly

2053
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,248
We are going the way that all other nations go when they

2054
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,296
So

2055
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,880
Isn't about Rodger this is the decline of civilization

2056
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,208
I don't think I like your strategy

2057
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:19,072
No I don't I think he's I think he's going around it I think he's going about it

2058
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:23,168
I mean I think what he's trying to do is capitalize on all the

2059
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
The larger number of stores

2060
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:28,032
By increasing his ads and all that s***

2061
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
When

2062
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,872
That's not really going to do it what he should be doing

2063
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,944
Is taking this time now that all these people are watching again

2064
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
You're really f******

2065
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,760
Hammered like crush this s***

2066
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,808
You're like give the best

2067
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,392
Free Rodger Stone performance that anyone has ever given

2068
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:49,792
Andy should turn on Trump absolutely fire and brimstone We Begin the the

2069
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,656
New conservative party that we're not going to call the white nationalist party but here

2070
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:58,240
Today the one option that has the best

2071
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:03,104
At the same time

2072
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Break your fall break

2073
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:10,528
Like you have the most eyes on you people are interested in what you're doing you can now

2074
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
Open

2075
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
Good conscience

2076
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,136
Retain what you need to retain

2077
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
From your Trump years

2078
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,976
Move on to something new

2079
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
Because

2080
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,840
Like it's something that even people on the left

2081
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,888
People who don't like

2082
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
Which will be like yeah

2083
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,264
Dvi-d to Hubert turn on Trump because he realizes

2084
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,288
He's not going

2085
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,824
To save any of us

2086
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,616
That is something we like

2087
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:42,016
Yep you'll get some people being like we told you so you dumb a****** but at the same time you can't argue with that

2088
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:47,392
Conclusion of course you should have seen this coming but yeah of course

2089
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:52,000
Other things like when he dropped bomb to Syria now it's as I can

2090
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:58,144
So close that is a position where if you turn on Trump for that people would be like

2091
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:02,240
What what is that say politically what is there would be

2092
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Fusion

2093
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,848
Him turning on Trump for not pardon Rodger Stone

2094
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,200
There's no a political thing

2095
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,736
Bucking llamas

2096
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:17,600
In-studio to get publicity and the publicity he would get if he just

2097
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,160
Came out on Infowars

2098
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,952
We no longer support Trump

2099
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:25,024
That would be MSNBC headlines that's that's

2100
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,048
The type of s*** that

2101
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:31,424
Inexplicably would get everybody talkin gone too far with this

2102
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
What if

2103
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,264
Wayne Rogers convicted

2104
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,616
Alex

2105
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:46,016
Going to keep people coming back and one of the llamas Rob do does a ventriloquist act with him at the lava turns on truck

2106
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:52,416
Okay alright I'm in the other llama gets a tattoo of Rodger Stone on its back

2107
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,464
Is just a pain

2108
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,488
Very cute it's cute

2109
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,512
So Alex

2110
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,560
Freaks out

2111
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,584
Here a little bit

2112
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:04,960
And I think some of it might have to do with the pressure of their being way more eyes on

2113
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,032
Building up suspense here

2114
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,848
He said suspense Ali

2115
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,872

01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
So

2171
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,880
Well it is true that Amy Berman Jackson the judge and Rodgers trial was also the judge in the case of palm

2172
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:06,208
That is true but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

2173
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:06,976
This is up

2174
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:13,120
They're only 15 judges in the US District Court for the District of Columbia and it's entirely possible that this was a coincidence

2175
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
Timer

2176
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:19,520
What you need to do better than just to say Obama appointed her to prove any kind of concrete conspiracy

2177
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,848
That's a pretty serious accusation to make about a judge

2178
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:29,760
If you look up a judge Jackson's History Alex's picture of a leftist judge Towing deliver a line just doesn't really seem to ski

2179
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
Square with reality

2180
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:36,416
Princeton she presided over the sentencing of Jesse Jackson jr. who was a Democrat member of the House

2181
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
And the son of Jesse Jackson

2182
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,512
What he stole about $750,000 of

2183
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
Can pay money

2184
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,584
You'd think she was a damn Hatchet person

2185
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,656
Judith thrown out of sentence but instead she put him in jail

2186
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,008
As a relates to Hillary Clinton she didn't do anything crazy in terms of Benghazi

2187
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
All she did is dismissive wrongful-death suit against Hillary because it would have been illegal for it to continue based on the Westfall

2188
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:03,040
The Westfall Act is a 1988 law that made it to the United States itself is to

2189
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
Be substituted as a defendant

2190
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:11,232
In cases where a government employee is sued for something that was the result of something that they did in their official capacity

2191
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,256
In their job

2192
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,304
This act explains a lot of questions

2193
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,096
Why government officials

2194
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,120
Vicars RV

2195
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,400
Constantly suit

2196
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,448
It's because they have a form of immunity

2197
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,728
In terms of their official business

2198
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,592
Alex can say that this judge was protecting Hillary but to do anything other than what

2199
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:31,200
She did Judge Jackson would have violated this Freeport ruling and a law passed by Congress

2200
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,016
It would have been very illegal for her to allow that lawsuit

2201
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,064
Interesting life

2202
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,856
In looking at the judge Jackson

2203
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,672
I found a website that I had become fascinated with

2204
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
And I

2205
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,232
Too much time on

2206
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,024
It's called Patriot or traitor

2207
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:46,816
Don't

2208
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,120
Don't don't Jordan

2209
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:55,520
This is a Blog this is not tell me that you can just type in a name and it will tell you if there if it's been any name

2210
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,848
But there's a big database has come up with a list

2211
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:05,248
Traders and peppers

2212
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:08,064
An editorial position for traitor or Patriot now

2213
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:13,696
And I'm guessing who would create a website called trailer patriot.com

2214
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,720
I'm guessing that

2215
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
My guy

2216
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,072
Who I appreciate are probably going to lean more towards the

2217
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,608
The traitor side would I be correct

2218
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:25,216
I think that you can guess based on who would make a website

2219
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,264
Okay

2220
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,056
First one Amy Berman Jackson

2221
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:32,896
That was an easy LaVoy finicum

2222
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,456
You got shot at the Bundy standoff

2223
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,480
Patriot

2224
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:42,112
Mad Dog James Mattis General Mattis

2225
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:45,184
Pre 2018 or 2080

2226
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,976
I can't give you that information

2227
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
Going

2228
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
Updated to Trader

2229
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,608
It's not updated but he is a patriot on the website

2230
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
Okay here you go

2231
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:58,240
William Barr current attorney General William Barr

2232
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:00,544
God I need timestamps.

2233
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,408
People everybody is a traitor or a patriot

2234
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,968
Because they're all f****** shady as s***

2235
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,040
Okay

2236
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,928
I should have assumed it was trainer otherwise why would you even bring it up

2237
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,976
Representative John Lewis

2238
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,768
Civil rights activist

2239
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,792
John Lewis

2240
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,144
Is there a super Trader

2241
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,728
Bernie Sanders

2242
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
Timestamp

2243
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
There was a time when

2244
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,848
These people especially would consider burning a

2245
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,920
Patron but I'm going have to go with Trader you're correct trailer okay

2246
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
Edward Snowden

2247
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,296
Is it there's a couple here at the end that are a little bit too tough

2248
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,600
Interpersonal

2249
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
Even in the concern

2250
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,416
Community there people who would say that

2251
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,696
Snowden was absolutely a

2252
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,976
Traitor and there are plenty

2253
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,512
Patriots

2254
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,792
I'm going to go with

2255
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,888
Patriot

2256
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,680
Son of a b****

2257
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,960
And finally last one

2258
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:05,824
Justice Antonin Scalia

2259
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:09,664
Cub got a trailer

2260
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:17,088
I'm fine with it I did find if you go through this almost everybody who's the Supreme Court Justice

2261
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:24,000
Hell yeah cuz it is sooner or later you'll be able to find one Kaiser where you're like that's a traitor

2262
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:30,656
Honestly that site is not nearly as fun as the idea of it is it's mostly the walls of text and I should tell you there are

2263
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:34,496
Way more traitors that they preach

2264
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:40,128
Hey Waypoint is Alex needs to do better than this few wants to Superior judge just because she's going to send his friend to prison

2265
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:43,968
She had no legal reason to not dismiss the case against Hillary

2266
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:47,808
It's entirely possible it's a coincidence that she got both Rodger and manafort's case

2267
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:51,904
They're clear counter-examples in her judicial history like that of Jesse jacks

2268
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,464
Junior the temperature theory that she's a biased

2269
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,488
Set up kind of Judge

2270
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,560
You can really tell though he knows that more people are listening

2271
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:01,120
Detroit sound real smart and focus

2272
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,144
And I think it's

2273
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,472
He's doing it wrong you should be going full cravings

2274
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:08,544
Yeah probably

2275
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,568
Nobody wants to

2276
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,896
Listen to a professional broadcast your Alex

2277
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
F****** Jody

2278
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:20,320
So earlier you said that he's not building suspense right before he started freaking out

2279
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,112
It's because he has big news

2280
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,952
I talked to some of the journalists are scared to come on

2281
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,000
About

2282
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,792
What was said

2283
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,328
This morning and the trial

2284
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,632
When I tried

2285
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,168
Put Rodger in prison

2286
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,728
Until the February 6th

2287
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,312
Done and what happened there

2288
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,848
And what was said about

2289
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
Rodger

2290
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:47,200
And myself and you the lister's of this show

2291
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,224
You

2292
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,552
Building up the suspense

2293
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:54,112
I'm getting some documents

2294
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,904
Especially

2295
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,720
Erstatement

2296
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,560
Get this precisely the way it is

2297
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,496
About me

2298
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,896
Yeah so he's he's teasing you know he's asleep trying to tease this out

2299
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,456
Because he has a big things

2300
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,480
Happening on the show

2301
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:25,088
Isn't that what the real is really have anything

2302
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,416
So he's trying to make up something frantically

2303
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:32,256
Trying to find a way to spin whatever he's got going

2304
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:37,120
Yeah which is just basically that the people the prosecution was

2305
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:37,888
Arguing

2306
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,424
That his actions

2307
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,472
Were Abri to Rogers

2308
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:44,800
That's really all this this this holties is all about

2309
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,080
But here's the thing

2310
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,384
Alex does have something huge

2311
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,408
Going on

2312
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,224
But most people listening to his show wouldn't think this is

2313
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,016
Huge only I think it's

2314
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:58,624
And that is that he's got Larry Nichols coming on

2315
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
Join us again

2316
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:03,232
Sunday on the Sunday Shelby lot for 6 p.m. or Monday

2317
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,256
We get more time

2318
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:09,888
25

2319
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:13,472
For the clintons was Green Beret.

2320
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,008
Cih.

2321
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,032
He didn't help them

2322
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,848
Get elected

2323
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,808
Bill Clinton in a memoir gilded, very dangerous person

2324
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
Well he is

2325
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Stanford

2326
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,136
Crazy

2327
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:34,976
To my knowledge Larry Nichols has not been on Alex's show in over to you

2328
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:41,376
I can't say with absolute certainty but I know that I haven't heard him on the show since September 21st 2017

2329
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:46,752
Why would I remember very well because I was at a Larry threat to Blackmail Congress and Mueller

2330
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,032
If they didn't stop invest

2331
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,336
Navigating trough old crime

2332
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
Great day

2333
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:55,968
That was a good one there's something going on here and I think it's something that I've been sensing for a while now

2334
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,272
When Joel skousen started making

2335
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:03,904
Increasing appearances on the show I thought it was possibly an indication of Alex shifting things a little bit in his show

2336
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:09,792
Thousand made it very clear that he doesn't think much of trump and actually called him an idiot many times on Alex

2337
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:10,560
The show

2338
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:14,912
After the 2016 election when Alex was at the high point of his Trump infatuation

2339
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:19,520
This led to them not seen eye-to-eye and he really was around too much as a trusted source

2340
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:22,592
But he's coming back on the show now which is interesting

2341
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,616
More regular

2342
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,664
Then on November 14th

2343
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:31,552
Sorry on the 13th Alex it's deep pieczenik back on the show after him being gone for over a year

2344
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:35,904
And now here we have Larry Nichols brought back from the dead after a very long absence

2345
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:40,000
I think these three reappearing a very interesting and I'll tell you why

2346
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,120
Alex lost a lot more expert than just these three when he went full Trump

2347
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,912
Webster Tarpley hates

2348
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,960
And he would never talk to Alex again

2349
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
Wayne Madsen

2350
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
I hate Trump

2351
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,336
And now if use Alex as some kind of a shield most likely for is

2352
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,408
These were dudes that Alex built narrative

2353
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,456
Webster Tarpley was like 1

2354
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,504
Third of The Obama Deception documentary

2355
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
You were Central figures

2356
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,320
Annabi infowar

2357
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,392
Thousand Steven Lee rear import into

2358
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,672
But they're guys that

2359
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,696
Alex

2360
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,232
Has don't hate

2361
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,512
For what he's become

2362
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,560
Steven larrier into Trump

2363
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,352
But obviously for their own reason

2364
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:19,168
He wants to install a dictator and Larry just hates

2365
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:24,288
Thousand doesn't like Trump but he still respect to Alex because they're shared in Saint

2366
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,056
Communism

2367
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:28,384
These are the three experts from days past to Alex Cooper

2368
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:31,712
Credibly bring back into his roster while transitioning wafer

2369
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,736
From chop successful

2370
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:38,368
And that. Skousen to be presented as an expert who is regrettably right all along

2371
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,648
The trumpet body to great

2372
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,928
Promise for them but wasn't

2373
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:41,696
Coptic enough

2374
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,720
The follow-through

2375
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:48,096
You can make up stories about how Trump could have saved everyone but the counter-coup is just too strong

2376
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:51,680
Larry can connect any stories about any Democrat to the clintons

2377
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,496
And Whisper ominously about witches he is got

2378
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,776
You've got that

2379
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,800
Let's kill in space

2380
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,568
Witches

2381
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:02,688
It's like he's the best at playing Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon butt

2382
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,968
Instead it's always clean

2383
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,784
I accept that I'm probably

2384
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,808
Play overthinking

2385
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,344
But from where I'm sitting

2386
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,136
Seems very suspicious

2387
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:17,792
Thousands been reintegrating and then on the day of the impeachment inquiry starting the hearings Steve is back

2388
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:21,120
And now the day Rodger is found guilty Larry is back

2389
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,936
It could all be a coincidence I'm totally

2390
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,728
Find the Baddie look

2391
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
Various

2392
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,776
Find possibility

2393
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,848
But these dudes were regulars on the show years

2394
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,896
And just a few years back

2395
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:37,504
They were the people who replaced by the Gavin McInnes is in the Mike starcevic crowd

2396
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:39,808
For them to be making a resurgence

2397
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,088
Feels like it means something

2398
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,880
But I want to stress that I could

2399
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,928
Just be drawing conclusions that aren't necessarily there

2400
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:48,512
Another reason that I think this maybe might not mean anything

2401
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,280
Too big

2402
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:53,120
Is it Alex's in the middle of trying to pretend that Hillary is secretly running in 20

2403
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,912
T20 so why wouldn't he call Larry

2404
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,496
He's trying to run an imaginary Auntie Hillary campaign

2405
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,288
But it doesn't have Rodger this time

2406
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,616
So it makes sense that he would resort to whatever he remembers from

2407
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:06,432
That's the pizzagate narratives coming back

2408
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,736
And Larry Nichols dumbass showing back up to

2409
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,272
It makes some sense

2410
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,320
But it does also fit a pattern

2411
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,904
Of what you would do if you were trying to save what

2412
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
You could

2413
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:19,744
Bright-eyed what I see is that

2414
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,792
That

2415
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:22,816
What is it

2416
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,608
Common Sports narrative

2417
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,912
We're the guys hanging out with his friends

2418
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:30,752
We're from We're from wherever will always be from wherever

2419
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,056
Doesn't matter he goes to the big time

2420
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:36,896
Stops hanging out with his friends is like now I don't have time for you

2421
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:43,552
I got the president elected I'm above this s*** and they didn't get you went back to his routine he's got a

2422
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,880
Broken ankle and he's never going to be able to play again and all the sudden

2423
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,416
Now he's back home

2424
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,184
He's got a

2425
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:55,584
F****** fix the relationship

2426
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,120
View and it's difficult

2427
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,912
To tell how much is it

2428
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
Is

2429
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,008
Some sort of a plan like that

2430
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,288
But it feels like

2431
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:07,360
I mean we're hearing these indications of Alex being like

2432
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,408
Trump doesn't he's not going to

2433
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:14,528
Back. So you're not going to Pardon Trump Rodger I don't know what I'm going to do

2434
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,552
You have

2435
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,600
Simultaneously the recurrence of these

2436
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,880
These people who are

2437
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,416
The people from his

2438
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,184
Past

2439
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:24,256
That have drifted for various reasons

2440
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,304
Could reintegrate

2441
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,352
And and work

2442
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:33,728
I don't I just told man no here's with Eva ears with you and better and this is where I got it

2443
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:38,080
Alright he's he just came to La's been working his ass off

2444
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
Rodger Stone

2445
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,664
Get signed as his agent immediately

2446
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:48,064
Trump he's got that he's the head of the studio he's getting all kinds of pictures lined up everything is going

2447
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
When is wife all the sudden

2448
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
Stone

2449
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,720
Gets arrested in truck stops answering his emails and now

2450
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:58,304
That's where that's where I see it so that's where

2451
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,096
He goes back to his f******

2452
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:04,192
Missouri Hometown little improv theater

2453
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,752
Bang it out yeah

2454
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:12,640
Start a band whatever whatever the reality of it is I sent to drifting away

2455
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:17,248
I sense a possibility of it being

2456
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,344
More anti-hillary than Pro Trump

2457
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,392
Certainly

2458
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,440
These are the

2459
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:27,232
Three people that I can think of

2460
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:30,304
That aren't around or hasn't been around anymore

2461
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
That Alex

2462
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,096
Could still

2463
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,120
Douche it where

2464
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,960
Yeah a lot of those other people if you try to bring them into the show

2465
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,240
It would be confrontation

2466
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,800
It would be like if Webster Tarpley was on

2467
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:44,384
He would probably talk about how libertarianism is

2468
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:50,784
Is a gateway to Fascism and I don't know.

2469
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,832
Like what the f*** is wrong with you

2470
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,368
Then all those things would

2471
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,392
Turn

2472
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,440
Steve skousen

2473
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:59,232
Larry r

2474
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,256
3

2475
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,536
Ways to connect

2476
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,072
The past to the present

2477
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,608
To have a coherent

2478
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:09,472
Connection of Brentwood

2479
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,776
They're like a constant

2480
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:14,336
Stanley lost terminologies

2481
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,152
It's a bridge between the past and the present

2482
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,944
That he can use to work toward

2483
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,736
Future that is different

2484
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,016
Then what he has now

2485
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:26,368
I don't know I don't know. Just doesn't have Stones Rolodex

2486
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:29,952
Could be there's a there's a hundred possibilities

2487
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:33,024
Could just be that he's I got no one else or talk to him

2488
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,840
It could be nothing but

2489
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,400
I just sent trends

2490
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,448
P****

2491
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,728
The problem with that

2492
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:44,544
I don't see any way that it

2493
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,080
Because if you're going to stop

2494
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,384
If you're no longer

2495
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,152
Carrying water

2496
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:52,480
And if you're no longer defending all of the s*** he

2497
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,528
Then you've only got

2498
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,552
Anti

2499
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,600
Hilary stuff

2500
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,160
There's there's really nothing there

2501
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,208
So you all you've really got left from

2502
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:10,656
You do what you do have that to some extent I think that you have a tough time threading that needle

2503
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
But

2504
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,984
You could also really regroup

2505
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,264
And be like okay

2506
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,568
What we need is a trump but more competent

2507
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,360
And loyal and trustworthy

2508
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:23,456
Repeat shut up shut up about the whole f****** dictatorship

2509
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,760
You get the f*** out alright

2510
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,064
That will be another one

2511
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,392
Sorry Steve was just screaming in my ear

2512
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:35,488
You could you could see Alex trying again

2513
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:38,304
With a more principled person or something

2514
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,632
You can see him getting behind Jim Jordan as their new like Ulta

2515
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:48,288
Or something like the new figurehead trying to reconnect with Rand Paul

2516
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,080
Options

2517
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,360
You could go to it right

2518
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,128
Cool

2519
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,920
You look too right

2520
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:56,480
We talked about this a hundred times Alex's show works at

2521
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:59,552
The counter to something as opposed to a supporting of death

2522
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,344
So it doesn't matter

2523
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,160
If he has somebody fully to support

2524
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:07,744
You need to get that Albatross off his neck

2525
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,512
And get back to

2526
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,280
To just attack

2527
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,328
Attacking Hillary

2528
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,120
Is something and the Deep state

2529
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,656
Can't be done without

2530
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:15,680
Anybody can

2531
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:17,728
And skousen Larry

2532
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:18,496
And Steve

2533
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,264
AR

2534
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:20,800
Great tools

2535
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:25,152
To have for him in terms of furthering that goal getting back to what works

2536
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,456
As opposed to sycophantically

2537
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,224
Praising

2538
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,760
Your God

2539
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,320
Yeah and they're all what is it done for him

2540
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,112
You got Carpe donktum hanging out

2541
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,392
Yogi's got there

2542
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,976
He's got all these meme dicks

2543
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,584
It's deathly alternative yeah that is

2544
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,864
That is so

2545
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,656
That must be so disheartened

2546
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,704
Just like that whole like

2547
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,752
The reason that I joined the truck

2548
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
Cuz I was prey

2549
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,824
Elevation

2550
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,360
And all I've got left

2551
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,384
Is

2552
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,408
Carpe donktum

2553
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:02,272
A guy with stuff with a hammer I don't know if he's going back on the Shelf

2554
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,040
I doubt it

2555
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
He's a little bit big

2556
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,344
Do you know who isn't

2557
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,136
Larry f****** things

2558
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:11,744
So we get to hearing this raspy ass voice.

2559
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:15,072
What is the Rodger Stone situation

2560
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:22,752
About 25-30 years ago

2561
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,872
Rodger

2562
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:32,736
Attack

2563
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:36,832
So Rodger Larry wants to bring

2564
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,600
Soros

2565
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:42,208
Into a conspiracy here but it's really funny because of this next clip

2566
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,488
UCare come up with Soros

2567
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,792
He's like I know there's a bad guy

2568
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:52,192
Nobody's talkin about

2569
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:55,776
What's his name

2570
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:04,480
Tell me you're saying Mana

2571
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,552
It's okay Larry stay there

2572
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:11,392
I don't I don't think that that is like an aging

2573
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,440
Memory loss kind of thing

2574
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:16,000
I think that's just not at Larry heaven

2575
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:18,560
Seriously but not really knowing what he's talkin

2576
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,328
Yeah yeah

2577
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,632
That's why I don't remember this guy's name

2578
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:23,680
8U juggling too many bad guys in it

2579
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,984
Yeah probably

2580
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,032
So many Boogeyman

2581
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:30,336
Who knows which one supposed to go where

2582
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,616
Soros

2583
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,176
The Rock

2584
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,224
So

2585
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,808
Alex comes back we heard that music again

2586
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:42,368
I'm telling you it plays throughout most episodes

2587
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,648
He hates his crew

2588
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
So much I would too

2589
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,232
Do they come back in Alex gets

2590
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:52,352
Talking about how he's really mad about the fact that his name came up in the trial

2591
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:58,240
I'll probably get destroying the process here the next few years

2592
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,776
You know what

2593
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
Because

2594
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,456
Are you

2595
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,248
Cannot do along with these people

2596
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,904
Department of trump

2597
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,280
Entitled

2598
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,864
But they really believe I should be in a jail cell

2599
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:27,424
Because that which war criminal Hillary didn't get in

2600
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:32,288
Nichols Lake Hughes breaking things

2601
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,056
Also

2602
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:35,104
Well he's back soon

2603
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
Do you really get into all this

2604
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,968
Please remember what recipe

2605
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:48,928
So what Alex is talking about there in that clip and it's basically just the big news that he had to deliver it it keeps teasing

2606
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,232
I already thinks that the court wants him arrested

2607
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:53,536
Yeah this is neither true nor is it big news

2608
02:05:54,304 --> 02:06:00,448
I was trying to find ecliptic out of him talking about this but honestly the deliver of it delivery of it when he gets around to it is so rude

2609
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,240
Rambling and incoherent that I felt

2610
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,288
We just talked about it

2611
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:07,104
On his show on the 14th Alex reported to have that message

2612
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:07,872
Rodger

2613
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:12,224
That message was largely felt like he was going to be found guilty and he wanted Alex's audience

2614
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,016
Pray for him and for Trump to pardon

2615
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,320
This is unfortunately wrapped in messages

2616
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:20,928
From Alex that if Rodger got found guilty of what needed goes around the White House and bullhorn them

2617
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:25,024
And that it was the end of freedom

2618
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,816
Caught up in it already

2619
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:30,144
So because of that you know they did

2620
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,168
Just felt like we've already

2621
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:36,288
But that's the new talked about in court that Alex

2622
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:40,128
Might have been responsible for breaking the gaggle

2623
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:43,200
So ultimately you know

2624
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,992
Holding Rodger after

2625
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:49,088
The sentencing after the verdict

2626
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:58,560
Is there any thinks it's the fact that they retained the gag order is something that is very responsible to do

2627
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:01,888
So while under the gag order Rodger posted an image of Judge Jackson

2628
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,168
Lacrosse hair

2629
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:08,288
Alex has a habit of targeting people for harassment and that behavior has been particularly badly

2630
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,080
It is to botched attempt

2631
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,128
Suggesting Rogers potential juror names

2632
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,664
Particularly notable

2633
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:17,248
Plus the case Rodger was being tried for involved Witness

2634
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,040
Tampering and intimidation

2635
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:24,416
Putting them under a gag order is like spending someone's drivers license when they're awaiting trial for a DWI

2636
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
You show me

2637
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,488
Did the behavior response

2638
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,304
More importantly you can hear

2639
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,352
Italics this frustrations grow

2640
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,704
His buddies are out here on the front lines and either doing everything they can

2641
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,472
Trump refuses

2642
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Active support

2643
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:41,312
Alex's TV turning on Trump so many times

2644
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,592
I can't really trust anything

2645
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:44,640
But I think that like

2646
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:47,200
His Petty feelings about being abandoned

2647
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,480
Are the most plausible thing

2648
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,784
You are

2649
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:53,600
If this is a situation that could easily

2650
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,624
Create those feelings

2651
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,928
That's the only reason why I take any of this like

2652
02:07:57,184 --> 02:08:00,512
As a possibility that's worth discussing

2653
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:03,840
Like his behaviors so well

2654
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:07,168
He could trample all over any political position that Alec

2655
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:07,936
Alex has ever had

2656
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,984
Obvious but he go but if he's

2657
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,008
If he's like

2658
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:14,848
Oh no sorry Alex I don't care about you what are you what have you done for me lately

2659
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,896
I don't remember you being that important to me

2660
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:20,480
Your actions were great but they don't deserve any

2661
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,248
Reward

2662
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,272
Is

2663
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,808
The recipe for him

2664
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:30,208
Yeah so in the next clip Alex is talking to Larry and makes an interesting caveat

2665
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,256
Just get into the impeachment

2666
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,168
And what you think her next moves are going to be

2667
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,264
Front bolts

2668
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:49,664
Anything I say Alex is not responsible for it's from me and that the prosecution won't come after me come out

2669
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,344
Rodger Stone go to jail

2670
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,704
He won't be there a week

2671
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:24,992
Why is Larry saying that Alex is responsible for his work

2672
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:29,856
Is that because the last time he was on he blackmailed Congress okay so there is that

2673
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:33,184
And you don't want to have any of that masks the boilerplate

2674
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:39,584
They're definitely does sound like there was a feels like

2675
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,864
Talk a lot of s***

2676
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,936
I don't want to get too I'm already getting soon already places

2677
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:46,240
Everybody everyone yells at me

2678
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:49,312
Me for things that my gas say can you please make a disclaimer

2679
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,360
I wouldn't be surprised if every guest

2680
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:54,432
Going for it doesn't have to put some sort of that Bart

2681
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:58,528
Yeah so Larry has a theory and it's not well fleshed out

2682
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,552
In his

2683
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,576
Words

2684
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,880
But I know from looking into this.

2685
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,952
And he'll get

2686
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,232
That way

2687
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,280
LOL spelled out those words

2688
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:12,096
Talking about the impeachment

2689
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
Deep

2690
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
Thanks

2691
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,704
That it is very notable

2692
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:18,752
That Adam Schiff

2693
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
Is a screenwriter

2694
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,336
Yasso

2695
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,872
What's going on

2696
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:24,640
Is

2697
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,176
That Adam Schiff

2698
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,712
Is screenwriting

2699
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:28,736
A play

2700
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:30,016
In real time

2701
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,040
That is the impeached

2702
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:34,112
That's basically the long and short of his beer

2703
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,184
Impeachment

2704
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
Play one

2705
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,608
To the prosecutor

2706
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,144
Which one

2707
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,008
Is that it turns out

2708
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:00,992
This whole script is going through now it's a subpoena crap

2709
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:06,624
Figured out that the moment case

2710
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,232
About halfway through the Mueller investigation

2711
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:20,192
Adam Schiff

2712
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:27,872
Thought about that hobby when we're back in 2 minutes with Larry nickel cuz I'm going to shut up for a while let him break it down

2713
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,920
I mean to make this

2714
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:35,040
You've literally saying it's a screenwriting getting it's not metaphorical

2715
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:43,232
He's he's doing it as like a f****** Twilight Zone episode where the mystery novel writer

2716
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:45,792
The Mysteries become real

2717
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:48,096
She's at so Larry is on

2718
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:50,400
Primarily probably because

2719
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:56,800
He had this story about the Ed Buck being involved with Adam

2720
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,568
Gets to that

2721
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:58,336
And then

2722
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:04,480
I don't know if you can make more sense of this than I can but Larry literally says in the middle of this clip

2723
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:08,832
Adam Schiff went to these parties at bucks house dressed like an Egyptian

2724
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,624
Because he's a screenwriter

2725
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
Okay

2726
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
Flummox

2727
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:18,816
Dancers going after the ringleaders crimes exposing them and that's

2728
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,632
Withered confirming

2729
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,912
Knows that Adam Schiff

2730
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,472
Good bodies

2731
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,240
Asbach

2732
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:28,800
Is there any 16 x bizarre sex parties

2733
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,384
Ritualistic mock human sack

2734
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,152
Sacrifice

2735
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,456
Diaries

2736
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,248
Black man

2737
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,552
Someone crawling begging is he

2738
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:40,832
Punch needle

2739
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,648
Sacrifice

2740
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,416
Purportedly

2741
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,696
Nichols getting back

2742
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:48,000
What you were saying longer saving coming up

2743
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:51,840
Please continue with the hobby of

2744
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:53,632
What your sources are saying

2745
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:08,480
Back off your receiver a little bit

2746
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,088
Verification 27 times

2747
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,392
He was at a party

2748
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
It's always up in evening

2749
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,144
7

2750
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:34,336
Battleships

2751
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:40,224
Like you said Egyptian type

2752
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,504
Demon

2753
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:47,904
Freaky weird Egyptian type demon outfits because he's a screenwriter

2754
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,208
Now

2755
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,744
I mean

2756
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,280
Diagram what I think

2757
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:55,328
He's saying so you're taking some notes

2758
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:57,632
So if I understand this correctly

2759
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:58,400
Yeah

2760
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:03,520
In order to further his screenwriting career

2761
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:09,664
Head of the house Judiciary Committee Adam Schiff his dressing

2762
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:12,736
Egyptian outfits

2763
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:15,552
To go to ritualistic sacrifice

2764
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,832
Yes and it's

2765
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,880
Important to note that they must be

2766
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,672
Because he only goes in the

2767
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:21,952
Evening time

2768
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,720
Alright

2769
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:29,120
So I want to get this out of the way up top nothing I'm saying or any takes on this story that I have should imply that I have

2770
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,656
Any interest in defending Ed buck

2771
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:33,984
I hope his case is Thoroughly investigated and he's punished to the fullest

2772
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:38,848
I think it's good for people to talk about that case as long as they stay grounded in reality

2773
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,408
However I don't think that's what Larry is doing

2774
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:45,504
Larry's been pushing this Adam Schiff narrative since at least October 11th

2775
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,088
When he made a startling allegation on the YouTube show crowdsource

2776
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:49,856
The truth

2777
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,392
It's pretty complicated

2778
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:56,000
Describe what that show is but I think it might be fair to say it's a bargain bin Infowars

2779
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,792
Where Alex's guest go when Alex

2780
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,560
Is too busy

2781
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:04,704
Like when you get kicked off Twitter you go to gab it's kind of the same thing when a guest is no longer welcome on Infowars

2782
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,544
It still has an itch to lie to people they end up going to crowdsource the truth

2783
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:12,384
Jerome corsi and Larry Nichols are two of the show's regular guests

2784
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:17,504
The host Jason Goodman is also welcome to his show some of the more unsavory character

2785
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,552
Who popped up on Alex's show over the years

2786
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:23,392
There's Robert David Steele the guy who told Alex a globalist

2787
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,928
Can kidnap children to Mars base

2788
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,024
I do think the two of them have had a falling-out though goodnight Robert David Steele

2789
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,304
There's Laura Loomer

2790
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,608
Larry klayman

2791
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:34,400
Playsuit Alex along with their on Coursey

2792
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,680
Is Jack Pacific

2793
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:41,568
Project Camelot overlap in which Jason is head Kerry Cassidy on at least once

2794
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:42,592
As well as her big

2795
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:44,896
False flag expert

2796
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:49,504
We haven't covered because it was episodes are not Project Camelot fun

2797
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,088
Reviews on Project Camelot Circle false-flag along with

2798
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:56,160
Jim Fetzer sometimes the guy who wrote the book no one died

2799
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,720
So much

2800
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:02,304
That if Adam Schiff and I don't even care if it's true or not

2801
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:07,424
Adam Schiff likes to write screenplays and it's off time and that's evidence that you

2802
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,216
Some sort of a

2803
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:14,336
Evil whatever it is but Kerry Cassidy tried to write screenplays

2804
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,360
But

2805
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:19,968
She's the only one who's exposing the real truth now

2806
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,784
Nothing matter

2807
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:29,184
So hilariously the thumbnail image on one of the videos of this crowdsource the truth that was interviewing old lady

2808
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,208
Is just

2809
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,744
The Illuminati card game

2810
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,888
Okay of course and has the title quote our globalist Elites Playing Our Lives as a game

2811
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:44,288
Honestly I've considered covering that show as a Wacky Wednesday option but every time I've tried I just find the host so boring and

2812
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,824
Content very unengaging

2813
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:50,688
With Larry coming back into Alex's life I might have to reconsider but I probably won't will

2814
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:57,344
Jason Goodman himself has been at least featured on David Knight show but I'm not sure he's ever made it to the rarefied air of being on

2815
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,112
Alex

2816
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:01,184
You also sometimes talks to people who Alex doesn't ignore

2817
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,232
Like Mike Adams and Owen Shroyer

2818
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:07,328
Also Jason Goodman was one of the journalists who attended Alex's weird press

2819
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,864
Back in April of last year

2820
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:11,680
It does show the traffics in all the real dumb

2821
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
Cool conspiracy theory

2822
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:14,752
Like pizzagate Seth rich

2823
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,032
The Las Vegas shooting

2824
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:18,592
He's even down with the dump Dennis Montgomery Village

2825
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,384
My point here

2826
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:24,736
Is it this is basically a junior varsity Infowars and it's not a good

2827
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:30,112
That's where Larry Nichols started putting this information out after which point it gets repair

2828
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,160
Repeated ad nauseam in The Fringe

2829
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:32,928
Right-wing media

2830
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:36,000
It's really easy to get this narrative cooker

2831
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,536
Larry's a lunatic

2832
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:39,584
The 20-something year record of making

2833
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,120
Shut up for attention and money

2834
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:44,448
But he can just go on a dumb YouTube conspiracy show say so

2835
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:45,216
Stupid s***

2836
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:47,776
Then sites like true pundit will report

2837
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:51,616
Well breathlessly calling Larry a consummate Washington Insider

2838
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,152
Clinton confidant

2839
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:57,504
Jacked true pundit post articles and headlines like quote

2840
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,784
Whistleblower

2841
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,112
Investigating Adam schiff's Disturbing Behavior at Ed bucks method

2842
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:05,952
Sex house with no confirmation or evidence other than Larry saying it

2843
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,256
Sites with real smart

2844
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:10,560
Sonic games like Global Intel hub

2845
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:14,656
Get your report on the story linking to the true pundit story saying quote

2846
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:17,216
Officially ship is under investigation

2847
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,032
His story get to the added Flair

2848
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:24,128
Of credibility because there are pictures of Schiff and buck at events together

2849
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,664
Because Buck was a huge

2850
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,432
Political donor

2851
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:29,504
And because of that of course bucks crime deserves

2852
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,528
Particular attention

2853
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,296
I don't disagree

2854
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:37,696
Or any other politician is they turned a blind eye to Bucks actions because of like financial support

2855
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:39,488
And they should be held to account for that

2856
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,864
But the simple fact of buck donating to shift or ship being seed with buck at a public event

2857
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,656
It doesn't prove anything on its own

2858
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:49,728
What Larry and Alex are doing is completely unacceptable

2859
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:54,592
Because they don't care about bucks crimes except how they can be used to further their political ends

2860
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,872
I find that shity

2861
02:18:56,640 --> 02:19:00,736
Is any of the stuff can ever be proven in any way I'm fine changing my position

2862
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:03,040
For now I have a standing position of

2863
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:05,600
Of not believing a damn thing Larry Nichols says

2864
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:08,672
Nothing could be confirmed by someone who isn't a career liar

2865
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,208
Yeah that picture that

2866
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,256
But you seem kind of pic

2867
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:14,816
Picture of trump with every Democratic lawmakers

2868
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:15,840
Does that mean they're all 8

2869
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,656
So do you understand though this pipeline

2870
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:23,776
You have Larry in October going on crowdsource the truth which is a dumb

2871
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:24,800
Conspiracy YouTube

2872
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:28,896
Joe he says this b******* on there it gets picked up by a Blog

2873
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,944
It has no goddamn

2874
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:34,784
Editorial stance or standards at all

2875
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,320
And then it gets repeated

2876
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:42,464
I like a game of telephone from the are confirmed in the mainstream news

2877
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:45,280
It's about blog post on true pundit

2878
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:46,816
It's based on Larry

2879
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:48,096
Just talkingshit

2880
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,400
Yep this is how the pipeline work

2881
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:52,448
CFI High School pictures

2882
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:54,496
Throwing 95 miles an hour in a

2883
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:55,520
8 month

2884
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,288
What's there in the maze

2885
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:57,824
Sure

2886
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:01,664
Larry has an interesting position about these

2887
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,200
These hearings that are going on

2888
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,736
The impeachment inquiry

2889
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,016
This is crazy

2890
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:09,600
You'll notice what they're doing they're using this

2891
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:10,880
Siri

2892
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:18,560
Come out

2893
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:22,656
And as we found out with them

2894
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:25,984
If you don't have anything to report to get hold of us

2895
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:29,568
And Chip will scream apart

2896
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,616
Want to say

2897
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:33,152
And of course

2898
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
They're making it very clear

2899
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:42,624
They'll never touch you will protect you

2900
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:47,488
Open casting call Leeza in impeachment inquiry

2901
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:52,352
Another way of saying that is he will include you in

2902
02:20:58,752 --> 02:21:00,288
I know

2903
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:02,848
Even if it's literal that's why God that's

2904
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:07,456
Bulshit Larry Clary

2905
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:13,856
Hardrace from you not this soft bulshit know where is usually this week

2906
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:19,488
Story right you will park at very dumb so what the other things Larry is bringing

2907
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,256
This

2908
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,536
Mentality

2909
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:23,072
Now that Rodger is going

2910
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:23,840
Prison

2911
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,632
We've got to be the voice of r

2912
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,728
No

2913
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:31,776
Your info on Snap

2914
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:40,736
We stand behind out tonight or anything like that

2915
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:58,144
I'm just like so he's going around to the United States and their down-ballot funding

2916
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,448
Skuter gin County Sheriff

2917
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,032
Anybody stand up

2918
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:07,104
America

2919
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:13,760
Just like anybody else

2920
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:14,784
So

2921
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,832
Larry is saying that we

2922
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:19,904
Voice of Rodger Stone right now

2923
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:24,000
We have to be

2924
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:26,816
Now that Rodger can't speak on Infowars then

2925
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,120
We have to be Rodger Stones voice

2926
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:35,520
Suspicious I think we do and now he's remembered soros's name is remember the narrative you supposed to push and that is

2927
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:37,056
That they're trying to

2928
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:37,824
Hippies

2929
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:41,408
Prosecutor is in in rural areas in order to

2930
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:43,712
Camp down rural descent

2931
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:44,992
These f****** dudes in

2932
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:46,016
County Sheriff

2933
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:53,184
Where do the highest Authority why why would that even cross your mind is not a crazy

2934
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,208
Nothing to say

2935
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:57,792
Soros is funding new County Sheriff's in order to

2936
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:03,168
Well it's because I think they recognized that the largest

2937
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,960
Share of their base

2938
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,728
And their audio

2939
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,544
He's probably people in rural areas

2940
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,592
Disconnected from

2941
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,872
Barger

2942
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:12,640
Communities

2943
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:13,920
Who are County Sheriff

2944
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:20,320
I am so like it does serve their interests to try and make them more scared position

2945
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,112
That's just so slow

2946
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:25,184
But Larry is insistent

2947
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,464
This isn't about Rodger

2948
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,744
This isn't even about Trump

2949
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:28,768
Thank you

2950
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:30,816
They know what they're doing

2951
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:44,384
Change

2952
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:47,456
Did you commit all those rides

2953
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:50,784
Beers Ago

2954
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,344
That would be a cool

2955
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,256
Ian

2956
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:01,792
Look

2957
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:03,584
This is all like just

2958
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:06,656
You know trying to personalize this to the audience

2959
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:09,216
You know whatever it's exactly what you'd expect them to

2960
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:11,776
And also what you would expect them to do

2961
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:12,544
Is Larry

2962
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,824
He's coming back

2963
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:15,104
Pay the bill

2964
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:19,968
And everywhere you turn

2965
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:26,112
Big words and everyone in submission

2966
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:29,440
It's a blessing to hear you Alex

2967
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,512
Commission

2968
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:47,360
Don't do it

2969
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:48,640
Stop it

2970
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:10,144
This is part of the arrangement upon his return

2971
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:11,680
Wow

2972
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:14,496
Or even if it's not it's just Larry knows the game

2973
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,032
He knows what he has to do

2974
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,824
And that Harkins all the way back to sir

2975
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,104
Ted Anderson

2976
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,128
Gold sales

2977
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:21,408
Oh yeah

2978
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:22,176
Apparently

2979
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,200
Bulshit

2980
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:25,504
Alright you might as well be reading off

2981
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:26,528
Totally

2982
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,088
So do you think Larry thinks that Hillary is running

2983
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,392
You know what I mean

2984
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:34,464
How to say that Larry thinks that there's no way Hillary's going

2985
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,744
What she

2986
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,768
Trying to do

2987
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:38,048
What is orchestrate

2988
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,608
Actual candidate and then when the

2989
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,888
Candidate wins election

2990
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:46,496
She will kill the candidate and assume the role of president that would be better you just

2991
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:50,592
What I'm seeing what you see on it

2992
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,640
Going down

2993
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:58,784
She needs to be the head of it and she plans to be bad of it

2994
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:08,768
In the past if you have me on again

2995
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:12,352
I'll be glad to tell everybody exactly

2996
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,888
What they're doing

2997
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:22,848
Yeah you do let's flashback to when Larry was saying that Obama was going to run again in 2016 and then

2998
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:27,712
Declare himself America into a Muslim country

2999
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:28,480
So he would be the

3000
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:34,880
Baby king of mobile Islam right well it was either that or

3001
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:41,280
Trying to ruin his legacy as much as possible to remember when Larry was saying that they were going to launch a FEMA permit provision

3002
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:44,096
Government state of emergency because

3003
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:48,192
When the clintons do that if they're in charge

3004
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:51,776
Write the president when now that goes into effect

3005
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,312
And there are no sun

3006
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:59,968
Congress members who are coming out telling you the truth because when that s*** goes down baby come to me

3007
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:03,040
Yeah well it's either that or

3008
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:05,856
Great

3009
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:12,256
If you accept that there are only two possibilities each time he only was half wrong on boats

3010
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,280
Sure

3011
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:15,072
So did like when he says

3012
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:18,400
And she sees that it's going down that's what he's talking about

3013
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:24,800
Whatever government that where we get Kings and Dukes is about to start and she better be in

3014
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:25,568
Charge of that

3015
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,104
Liberty talking about this is like

3016
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:27,872
Horseshit

3017
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:28,640
Oh yeah

3018
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:29,664
So anyway

3019
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,200
You know

3020
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:32,224
Alex

3021
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,784
Try to talk about this

3022
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:37,856
So he

3023
02:27:38,112 --> 02:27:40,672
Alex starts telling a story that Rodger told him

3024
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,696
Free guy

3025
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:45,792
It's okay for him to tell the story no I'm going to go with

3026
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:49,632
Err on the side of caution man but it's about Rodger getting threat

3027
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:51,680
If you didn't do what the globalist wanted him

3028
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:54,752
Err on the side of caution Alex has also been threat

3029
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:56,800
But there's a weird reason why

3030
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,568
He doesn't talk

3031
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,104
Specifically about these threats

3032
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:01,408
I was told this before they

3033
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:02,688
Goddamn

3034
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,784
And so I can say it but he did have people reach out

3035
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,600
Talk to him from the system to turn against Trump daily Malone

3036
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,928
Add cigar SWAT team raid

3037
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:15,488
I've had the same stuff as well

3038
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:22,144
The closer than things like that and I and I and I

3039
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:24,704
Occasionally

3040
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:28,032
So I don't ever break those deals that's not criminal to meet with

3041
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:28,800
The criminals

3042
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,152
Meetings with the mafia people's Representatives

3043
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:34,688
And there

3044
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:37,760
Basically like I'm ever going to kill you I might well just go ahead

3045
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:40,064
You're going to get it after that politically

3046
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:45,184
The Alamo jackasses I will

3047
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,464
You understand

3048
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:48,256
You're going to get it

3049
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:57,216
Blood running down both sides

3050
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:03,616
Music again

3051
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:06,432
And so if I understand

3052
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:10,272
Sanders correctly tell me if you have a different interpretation haha

3053
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:16,672
He has been threatened by these globalized talk about it specifically more but he agreed to

3054
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:23,072
Confidentiality is confidentiality cuz he still likes to take meeting with these global

3055
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:36,640
I don't break these NBA's with

3056
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:42,528
Literal demon vampires who just having a meeting time to kill me

3057
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,880
Cuz then what would I do maybe they have some

3058
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:49,440
Something important to say sometime you never know

3059
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:51,232
Keep your friends close dead

3060
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,840
But keep your enemies closer by never violating their idea that's so stupid

3061
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,424
I can't believe someone would hear that be like that make sense

3062
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:04,544
Everybody

3063
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:05,824
Sofa

3064
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:10,176
Do you understand now they're like when I was telling you they keep playing the music

3065
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:12,224
Pears like this seems weird

3066
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:17,088
Do you agree with me because you look use I've never heard this I've never heard the same song this many

3067
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:20,672
How to be a little bit hesitant

3068
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,464
To accept my

3069
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,000
Conclusion that it seemed weird

3070
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:26,048
Okay

3071
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:30,400
Well I get the point that I'm safe disappointment up

3072
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:35,520
It doesn't seem weird to me because the level of incompetence is

3073
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,848
Is established at such a high level

3074
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:41,920
Man that they just don't know how to change the

3075
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:45,760
I can't tell what the explanation is but there's something

3076
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:52,928
Speed accidentally put their iTunes on repeat and they didn't know how to change it the problem with that is that it's not the old

3077
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:53,696
Calming music

3078
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:55,744
Play it played a lot

3079
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:02,144
But there's other music like in this next clip Alex comes back from break listening to music from The Good the Bad and the

3080
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:03,936
Arabic some say something

3081
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:10,336
Really f****** weird question

3082
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:16,736
Perfectly. The really great movie reality

3083
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:19,296
So that's

3084
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:24,928
Alex clearly articulating this this weirdness that he has about fiction and reality

3085
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:28,512
There's this there's an unreality to the movie that makes it real

3086
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,304
It makes it real

3087
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:31,584
House

3088
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:33,120
Yeah

3089
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:34,912
Larry is gone but

3090
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:36,704
Alex is still talking about the

3091
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,472
This Buck thing

3092
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:38,240
For a little bit

3093
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,776
They can't stop

3094
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,056
Muppet Chef

3095
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:46,432
That's not just Nichols and that that's in the news he was in all those party for that boss

3096
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:48,992
Drug addict

3097
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:50,016
Look at chef

3098
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:57,440
It's not just nickel saying that it's news articles that Larry is the only source saying it

3099
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,488
News

3100
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:03,840
Newsela true pundit the news is doing a dance

3101
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:08,704
We can believe in the media which I've course have been screaming that you shouldn't believe

3102
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,008
At all.

3103
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:13,312
Never believe the media they're all lying

3104
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,848
To you they are always lying

3105
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,640
You cannot trust them

3106
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:18,688
Embarrassing

3107
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:22,016
This is this is a good to Media

3108
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:24,576
Amin is only bad if they affect

3109
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:25,600
That's good point

3110
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:27,136
So Alex

3111
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:29,184
Rambles a bit about evil

3112
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:32,512
How do you not into it

3113
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:36,352
That's the description on every one of our four April Fools

3114
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:41,472
You should go back and edit every one of those pod cows Rambles about the devil

3115
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:44,544
So he's moving away from the Devil

3116
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,568
Anything corrupt

3117
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:47,616
Evil

3118
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:48,896
That was a joke

3119
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:54,528
Accelerating away

3120
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:55,552
Satan is behind

3121
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,600
I just want

3122
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:58,624
My children

3123
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:00,672
Your children and all these wonderful spirits

3124
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:02,976
They're good gentle creatures

3125
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:04,512
Witnessing to the universe

3126
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:09,120
And Justice and freedom and away from the Fallen Twisted in

3127
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:20,128
Gone

3128
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:23,712
Away from Adam Schiff

3129
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,992
Aleister Crowley

3130
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:34,464
You want to go away we want to leave you we want you

3131
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:40,096
I want to give you guys a chance cuz

3132
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:57,760
Get ready to sell my house so I can finally project which is I'm glad to do

3133
02:33:58,272 --> 02:33:59,552
It's just that with that energy

3134
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:07,232
Want money because it's a weapon system

3135
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:11,584
And it's because I can block his enemies attacks with it and then I

3136
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,120
Open carry out operations against

3137
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:16,448
Products you need everybody should get the force

3138
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:24,896
Lawsuits are not going well I know I'm sorry he's funding new projects I apologize

3139
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:26,944
Soap for a long time Alex is said that it

3140
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:29,504
He has to be willing to sell his house to fumbi infowar

3141
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:32,832
But this is literally the first time I've heard him talk about it as something

3142
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:33,856
He's actually doing

3143
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,648
I don't know if I believe

3144
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:38,976
Because Alex is a liar and it's in the middle of him doing an ad.

3145
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,608
Possibly pretty likely to create more incentive for people to give him by

3146
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:49,472
But assuming that that's not a lie this is a very very bad sign for Allah

3147
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:54,080
There's no way that selling his house could provide enough capital for him to run Infowars

3148
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:54,848
For very long

3149
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:57,664
This would just be a matter of him trying to buy a few months

3150
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,432
Set best

3151
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:01,504
The reason I say that is because Alex has made it clear that cost

3152
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:03,808
Tens of millions of dollars to run Infowars

3153
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:07,904
It's a complicated business with a gigantic Studio or rent it

3154
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:08,672
It's not low

3155
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:10,208
Tons of bandwidth costs

3156
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:13,280
Entire supplement business with a warehouse and distribution

3157
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,048
Connected

3158
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:16,608
A bunch of lawyers working on a ton of cases

3159
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,680
I don't know if tens of millions that figure is correct

3160
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:23,520
But I feel like it could be closed given how many moving Parts in Vellore

3161
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:30,432
The most expensive home sale ever in Austin with a gigantic mansion that went for 21.8 million dollars

3162
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:33,248
And currently the most expensive house on the market

3163
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:35,040
It has an asking price of 40

3164
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,320
18.9 billion dollars

3165
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:39,904
Alex obviously has a nice house and I bet it's worth a lot

3166
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,952
But it's nowhere near the top end of Austin

3167
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:43,232
Luxury property mark

3168
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:47,328
If I had to guess I would be surprised if his house was valued at more than a few mil

3169
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:51,168
Alex's said that his family owned some land

3170
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:55,776
I have a hard time imagining that his parents were still alive would allow himself acreage

3171
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:58,336
Been handed down generation Ali just so he can

3172
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:00,384
Can keep up paying the legal fees

3173
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,176
His Radio Show his rack.

3174
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:05,504
Plus I think if that's what he was saying he might phrase it differently

3175
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:08,064
Ultimately I don't know what to think here

3176
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:11,136
If he's saying that he's selling his house when he's not

3177
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:13,952
It's been it's just a crass and manipulative marketing ploy

3178
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:14,976
I think that's possible

3179
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:17,280
If he's actually selling his house then

3180
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,304
His show is going

3181
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,352
Not it's not going to make it another 6

3182
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:22,144
It's not like Alex

3183
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:22,912
Is Justin a tough

3184
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:25,728
Matching needs to get through it and then everything will be fine

3185
02:36:25,984 --> 02:36:26,752
You fuc

3186
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:29,568
In the long-run whether you makes it through this crunch or not

3187
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,360
His reach is non-existent

3188
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,640
His best friend

3189
02:36:32,896 --> 02:36:34,688
He changed his career for is going

3190
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:37,248
Prison he's crawling back to Larry Nichols

3191
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:38,272
Steve pieczenik

3192
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:41,088
Is attempted to dodge the Sandy Hook lawsuit or all failing

3193
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:44,160
The president has made the center of his career is getting impeached

3194
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:46,976
Those aren't little obstacles in the road

3195
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:49,536
Their major problems at six million dollars is

3196
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:50,560
Probably not going to

3197
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:51,328
Basalt

3198
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:52,352
Again

3199
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:53,888
I still think it's probably full of s***

3200
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:55,424
But if he's not using

3201
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,448
Serious trouble

3202
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:58,240
And I would probably advise him a

3203
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:00,288
You know this

3204
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:06,688
You need the house recorded podcast in trouble

3205
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,736
This is such a one of those moments

3206
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:09,504
It's like when you're being

3207
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:13,088
You got to admit sooner or later that

3208
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:16,672
Whatever it is that they're they have on you is

3209
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:17,696
Not as damaging

3210
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
Continuing

3211
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:19,744
Call game

3212
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:22,560
Just get it out get it done

3213
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,096
You'll be okay

3214
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:26,400
Let's let's look at this

3215
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:28,960
Let's say you've fallen for the Nigerian scam

3216
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:32,032
Fair enough. Is it good way of putting it

3217
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:33,568
Keep going

3218
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:36,640
You're in the sunk cost fallacy

3219
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:37,664
Genuinely

3220
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,712
There's a way out of this world

3221
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:43,040
It's it's probably not outside of like

3222
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:49,184
Scaling back and seeing if you could regrow a little bit somehow I think that's probably the only real ploy

3223
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:52,000
Dumping money into Infowars at this point

3224
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:55,840
Short of finding an angel investor who will give you million

3225
02:37:56,096 --> 02:38:01,216
Into dollars millions and billions of dollars to keep doing what you're doing

3226
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:02,496
Is a fool

3227
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:03,264
Pools game

3228
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,032
Yep

3229
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:06,848
So Alex at this point starts

3230
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:08,128
To speculate about

3231
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:10,688
So when I was talking about this stuff in like

3232
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:13,248
Alex bringing these guys back in

3233
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,528
Seems indicative

3234
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:18,112
Of a move away from trump it was a feeling that I was having

3235
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:20,160
And when I got to this point new episode

3236
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:21,184
I really feel like

3237
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:23,488
Maybe it's baby it's more than

3238
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:24,256
Then just

3239
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,024
My feelings

3240
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:26,816
Are you pissed

3241
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:32,960
Trying to sabotage

3242
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:34,752
I know that

3243
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:39,104
WeChat these people

3244
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:51,136
Hospice

3245
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:54,464
Yes

3246
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:55,488
Yes because

3247
02:38:56,768 --> 02:38:59,072
True

3248
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,888
That's true also

3249
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:05,472
God you're so close

3250
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,312
Always you know

3251
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:14,688
Let's not get distracted by the details stay on there

3252
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:16,480
Stay on target your doing this

3253
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:19,296
Come on

3254
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,232
Because

3255
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:29,280
Watertown did nothing wrong except

3256
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:32,096
Well it is legally there

3257
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:37,216
So you here this year

3258
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:41,568
Introduction of thoughts about a you-know-what maybe Trump

3259
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,848
Was put in

3260
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:43,616
In order to

3261
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:47,200
The pacify a neutralized elements of the right-wing

3262
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:48,224
That are anti-gay

3263
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:53,344
That's what you need to get there that's fine because if Hillary was in office

3264
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:59,744
Not we would put up with this s*** you now that you absolutely nailed it come on put two and two together only doing it because we're holding out hope

3265
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:03,328
You going to enact the white nationalist dictatorship that we will

3266
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,096
Where is it

3267
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:09,216
I mean it's still the end result still isn't good thinking it is what it is

3268
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:13,824
So I'm he's just at the end of this episode he's just starting to recognize these things

3269
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:16,896
You called me

3270
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:18,176
Have a message for

3271
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:19,968
Doing

3272
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:22,784
Calculus

3273
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:26,880
What's going on his brain about Rogerstown this is a lot bigger than Rodger Stone obviously

3274
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:30,208
Not good

3275
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:35,072
Rodger stone is not a fart in church

3276
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:36,608
That we just try to put

3277
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:40,448
Ninja Run

3278
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,472
Chords this

3279
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:43,520
Pardon Stone

3280
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:51,968
Talk about Stone

3281
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,600
Just like about Julian Assange

3282
02:40:58,624 --> 02:40:59,904
Call Julian Assange release the info

3283
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:05,280
The lack of loyalty

3284
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:13,216
Everything we told Trump

3285
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:15,776
All the moles everything Indiana

3286
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:17,824
Daddy

3287
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:25,248
Play it safe while playing it safe goddess

3288
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:26,016
Where We Are

3289
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
Stop playing

3290
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:31,648
I mean that's also illegal

3291
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:34,464
It's got the

3292
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:37,280
Political power

3293
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:40,096
Twisting out the wind is not good

3294
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,936
Right there you start to get the feeling that it's

3295
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:46,496
What Alex is doing it soda waking up

3296
02:41:46,752 --> 02:41:52,896
From a being manipulated to recognize like

3297
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:56,480
None of this s*** that I thought was going on is going on

3298
02:41:56,992 --> 02:41:57,504
Now

3299
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:59,296
Some of that could be

3300
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:01,088
The way you soft-launched a parody

3301
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:03,392
Piano like you soft launch pivoting away

3302
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:09,536
By pretending that you're waking up this deception that you

3303
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:12,608
Or it could be real I don't know what it is but you can

3304
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:13,888
You can clearly see

3305
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:18,752
That Alex is starting to weigh more explicitly talk about like

3306
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:21,568
Probably is not good

3307
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:22,336
My theory

3308
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:24,896
He is in a cult

3309
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:28,736
This is as close as he's as he's going to get in the next

3310
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:30,528
The next week is going to be him

3311
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:36,928
Get right back, cuz it happened over and over again. But also you have to recall when he did that thing after the

3312
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:38,464
We know

3313
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:41,792
From going over it Alex turned on Trump

3314
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:47,424
Drunkenly on air that night let's say he talked to Rodger who got him back in line

3315
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,984
Rodgers not going to do that this time

3316
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:52,032
Who does he have around him

3317
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:54,080
He has people like Joel Sanders in

3318
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:57,152
Don't get him back on Trump's team

3319
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:01,760
I don't think

3320
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:04,576
I don't think which is strange because everybody knows you listen

3321
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:07,648
Right I don't think the reintegrative

3322
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,672
Trump Network

3323
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:10,208
Whatever is there

3324
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:10,976
2

3325
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:12,256
Like get Alex back

3326
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:13,792
Into the fold if he starts drifting

3327
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:15,072
He doesn't have the cult

3328
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,120
It doesn't seem it doesn't

3329
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:18,656
Seem like that influences

3330
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:19,680
Is necessary here

3331
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:21,728
And for that reason I think it's

3332
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:25,056
Possible that some of these feelings will grow more than

3333
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:26,848
With Rodger prison

3334
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:30,944
Yeah if Rodger was there he would have been like Trump and I go way back we sucked

3335
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:35,296
Same ladies together not weird it's not weird like that we've

3336
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:40,416
Some fights in the past has made up but we didn't double team

3337
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:47,840
I have no comment

3338
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:48,608
That

3339
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:51,936
It is entirely possible that this is going nowhere

3340
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:53,728
Yeah and Alex will get back in life

3341
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:55,008
That's entirely possible

3342
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:58,336
Cuz I could see a situation where Trump does some sort of Overture

3343
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:03,200
Yeah Alexandra

3344
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,736
Back if possible

3345
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:09,856
But I also see it is entirely possible that this will be enough and Alex will get where he needs

3346
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:10,624
To go

3347
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:12,672
One of the reasons

3348
02:44:12,928 --> 02:44:13,440
Speak that

3349
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:14,208
Is

3350
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,488
Very often

3351
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,280
You'll see Alex's

3352
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:18,048
Narratives

3353
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:19,328
Pushing

3354
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:20,864
Reflected in caller

3355
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,400
So you get to call her

3356
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,192
This guy has to say

3357
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:27,264
Chris in Tennessee glencrest Round Here

3358
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:29,824
How's it going Alex

3359
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:33,920
Man I am a fired-up and just in war mode you don't sound like

3360
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:35,456
I hear you

3361
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:41,600
I'm a little sad in about what's going on thinking at a certain point when do we admit that Trump

3362
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:43,392
Isn't a white hat

3363
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:47,744
I mean Kingston sky

3364
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:51,328
And what you said you hit the nail on the head earlier I think like

3365
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:54,144
About to be smarter for the globalist to just

3366
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:57,984
Valerian or would it be smarter for them to have Trump in

3367
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:00,032
And just act like he's on our side

3368
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:05,152
I don't take that idea

3369
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:05,920
Because it

3370
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:10,016
The swamp he listen to advisors

3371
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:12,320
Rodger that

3372
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:14,368
Stop during impeachment

3373
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:18,208
The whole thing is a fraud everybody knows it called

3374
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:25,120
Don't talk about yours all of that is just pure Mafia tactics

3375
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:27,680
About Rodger

3376
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:30,240
Assign

3377
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:31,520
What's going on

3378
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:34,336
He's done a lot of stuff like saying America's good and

3379
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:39,456
Borders

3380
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:43,808
By saying two things out loud

3381
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:45,088
Is he

3382
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:47,136
Trump is not a wimp

3383
02:45:47,648 --> 02:45:48,160
But

3384
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:50,208
He's he's not as tough as he said

3385
02:45:54,560 --> 02:46:00,704
That's a really big wild on Alex's show

3386
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:06,591
Do not say Alex's show his world is so

3387
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:09,151
Bill toxically masculine

3388
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:09,919
Like the

3389
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:12,479
Action of masculine immature

3390
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:14,783
Copies of bullies out there just

3391
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:19,391
Or I can shop on people so strong

3392
02:46:19,647 --> 02:46:25,791
Was talking about that when he came back on the show that he's really not that talkative facade that he puts on that's why he needs

3393
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:30,143
Either so Alex

3394
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:30,911
You know being

3395
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:32,447
No Trump isn't that

3396
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:33,727
Tough is a

3397
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:34,751
Huge slapping

3398
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:36,799
Where is that might be

3399
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:37,823
Something in another car

3400
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:39,359
Contact someone else saying it your life

3401
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:43,455
It's an interesting thought for Alex to say it's equivalent to him being like

3402
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:46,015
He's not a man honestly

3403
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,807
Saying he should shove

3404
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,111
Isis up its dirty ass whole is like

3405
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:54,463
Oh that's just gentle ribbing about his friends saying that you're not tough is

3406
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:57,023
Yeah

3407
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:59,327
So just call her and Alex keep talking

3408
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:01,119
And Alex brings up at like

3409
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:03,679
Hey you know if people stand up

3410
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:04,703
For Trump

3411
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:05,471
Trouble

3412
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:07,519
And this caller brings up something

3413
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:11,615
That I think is so f****** hilarious it catches Alex so off guard

3414
02:47:11,871 --> 02:47:13,407
Giuliani stood up

3415
02:47:16,735 --> 02:47:19,039
Just Cuttin Giuliani Lewis

3416
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:20,063
Give me a break

3417
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:22,623
Don't you think julliannis

3418
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:24,415
Kind of shady he was probably involved in

3419
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:26,207
Covering up 9/11 when he was mayor

3420
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:32,607
Brother season right now

3421
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:36,959
Giuliani is a smart guy

3422
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:41,823
America

3423
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,615
Whoops

3424
02:47:45,663 --> 02:47:47,967
Alex don't you remember how this is

3425
02:47:48,223 --> 02:47:48,991
The guy

3426
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:56,671
No he was totally hear what he said there are two is like I'm more concerned with the season we're in

3427
02:47:56,927 --> 02:47:58,719
Yeah it's exactly what

3428
02:47:58,975 --> 02:48:01,023
Guy did 911 help cover it up yeah

3429
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:03,071
Absolutely. Likes Trump now

3430
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:05,119
That's the season were in

3431
02:48:05,375 --> 02:48:11,519
All that other stuff is not supposed to be important anymore

3432
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:17,919
Idols I yell all the time about the mainstream media thinking you have no memory but you're supposed to remember it

3433
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:22,783
Play build my career on 911 and all of this s*** yes absolutely 100%

3434
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:27,903
Forget about Giuliani Elizabeth Novak.

3435
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:30,975
I know you remember the original version but maclunkey

3436
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:37,375
So we just got to do that's okay

3437
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:38,399
And it's so awesome

3438
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:40,959
Here's somebody like one of these callers who is like

3439
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:43,775
Onboard with Alex and Alex feels like

3440
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:50,175
Are we supposed to not like

3441
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:53,247
Yes

3442
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,271
Okay

3443
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:55,039
B

3444
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:56,319
Now I vases

3445
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:57,087
Switch off one

3446
02:48:57,343 --> 02:49:03,487
Yeah hold on I'm going to need somebody to give me a cookie while I much the toll at the end of the f****** clip Alex saying

3447
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:05,791
Don't think he's trying to screw Over America

3448
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:07,583
How do you square that

3449
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:08,607
Well I mean

3450
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:13,471
Because he helped stage 911 it got us into the war in Iraq

3451
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:17,567
And he's not trying to screw Over America

3452
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:19,359
So this is the end of

3453
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:22,687
The I guess what you would call the substantiv Rodger Stone

3454
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:25,503
Pageant right

3455
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:28,319
I don't know on the 14th you have Alex

3456
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:34,975
Really acting irresponsibly whether or not Stone sent him a message or not

3457
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:36,767
No position on that cuz I can't possibly have

3458
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:38,815
But I can say

3459
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:40,607
Whatever message Rodger sent

3460
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:43,423
Alex deeply editorialize in a way that

3461
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:44,959
The jeopardize Rogers freedom

3462
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:48,031
After the verdict

3463
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:53,663
Been on the 15th Alex response to the verdict being passed by

3464
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:57,503
Marketing heavily and signaling

3465
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,295
Very

3466
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:06,207
We're interest in exploring the idea that Trump is not good it might be time

3467
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:06,975
We got a

3468
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:07,743
Jump shot

3469
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:09,023
So that's pretty interesting

3470
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:11,583
Now

3471
02:50:11,839 --> 02:50:15,167
He also talks to Rogers friend Tyler Dixon

3472
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:17,215
It's just basically Rogers school

3473
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:20,287
Is another narrative

3474
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:21,823
And that is

3475
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:23,615
I'll let I'll let out

3476
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:25,151
Running Man

3477
02:50:25,663 --> 02:50:26,175
Written by

3478
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:28,735
Stephen King

3479
02:50:30,783 --> 02:50:33,855
Yeah

3480
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:35,135
Put somebody else's face on

3481
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:36,415
Computers

3482
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:37,183
Future

3483
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:40,767
Wow like 2020 or something

3484
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:43,583
That's how crazy all this is

3485
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:45,887
This morning

3486
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:50,495
A my workout partner goes look at this funny video

3487
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,799
That your son wrecks tweeted

3488
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:58,687
As soon as I saw the video I called Rex up in 2017 but finish High School

3489
02:50:59,455 --> 02:51:00,991
And I said you said that

3490
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,063
Sent you this video

3491
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:07,135
They said all I just heard that it's a joke and I said well

3492
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:09,439
Okay somebody taking a blue screen of me

3493
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:11,231
It's footage that I shot

3494
02:51:15,327 --> 02:51:15,839
The meme

3495
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:18,143
We did a lot of the funny things I've done on Arab

3496
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:19,423
Vegan

3497
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:20,447
My head

3498
02:51:20,703 --> 02:51:21,215
Body

3499
02:51:21,471 --> 02:51:21,983
Thanks

3500
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:23,007
And then

3501
02:51:24,543 --> 02:51:28,127
I guess somebody the process is his sent out this this green screen video

3502
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:31,711
Now

3503
02:51:33,503 --> 02:51:34,271
Albion Court

3504
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:35,295
Over this

3505
02:51:37,343 --> 02:51:38,623
Corrupting minors

3506
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:40,415
So Alex's son

3507
02:51:40,671 --> 02:51:45,279
Tweeted out a green screen video of Alex doing some rapping

3508
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:49,631
Little bit of wrapping okay and in the background it's like a booty dance

3509
02:51:50,143 --> 02:51:52,191
Okay it's just like women shaking their ass

3510
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:57,311
Yeah so that's one state part of this

3511
02:51:57,567 --> 02:52:03,711
Right now the second part of it is Alex says it's someone put this over the green screen footage and he's trying to sort out

3512
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:05,503
Who did it I got one culprit

3513
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:12,927
What else presumably

3514
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:18,047
Other people then check in without

3515
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:22,143
He knows who he gave it to right now we got more suspect

3516
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:27,263
Okay whatever investigation runs through one man and his name is carpe donktum

3517
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:31,103
Yeah I don't blame anybody else for this

3518
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:35,711
This is a little prank I'm going to have to go a deep state

3519
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:37,503
God he sounds

3520
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:38,783
Such an old

3521
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:40,063
Yeah that is

3522
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:42,879
That is weird old grandpa but

3523
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:44,415
So now I find out

3524
02:52:44,671 --> 02:52:48,511
That my image can be put on the internet whenever they want and my son

3525
02:52:48,767 --> 02:52:49,279
Tweeted it out

3526
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:51,583
Two people to talk to

3527
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:53,631
Your son Carpe donktum

3528
02:52:53,887 --> 02:52:58,239
Bring this on your f****** radio show his Twitter account

3529
02:52:58,495 --> 02:52:59,519
Then take it away

3530
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:02,335
So now Alex says seems to think that no one understand

3531
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:06,687
What green screens are

3532
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:07,455
Christ

3533
02:53:11,295 --> 02:53:13,855
If I was in the street with a bunch of women

3534
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:19,743
Well it's just not good for kids to have you know

3535
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:31,263
Yeah no we do

3536
02:53:31,519 --> 02:53:35,871
They're on the news illegal when it's

3537
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:41,247
So everyone understands that I don't think I have a very tough time with that

3538
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:42,015
That is

3539
02:53:43,039 --> 02:53:45,087
I do I do feel

3540
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:47,647
People who are just

3541
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:50,463
Absolutely unprepared for technology

3542
02:53:51,487 --> 02:53:52,255
Haha like

3543
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:53,535
I imagine

3544
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:55,583
You know you're my grandpa

3545
02:53:55,839 --> 02:53:56,351
He was born in

3546
02:53:58,655 --> 02:53:59,423
The Great Depression

3547
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:02,495
He couldn't possibly have imagined that somebody

3548
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:07,103
Take her face and make it say things like a course she begin

3549
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,383
Loser s*** that's

3550
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:14,783
Too big for her but I don't think Alex is overwhelmed by the actual technology everyone else exactly

3551
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:17,855
Which proves

3552
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:21,951
He himself is overwhelmed by all the technology to an extent

3553
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:28,607
I mean this is a 02 me as it relates to the actual video I think it's just a dumb Alex me

3554
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:30,399
I really give a s*** about it

3555
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:32,703
But as it relates to Alex's like

3556
02:54:33,471 --> 02:54:35,007
Covering of it

3557
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:41,919
It's weird I cuz he's seems to be legitimately concerned he really guy that there will be a consequence.

3558
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:42,943
Screamed video

3559
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:46,271
To the extent where I feel like he's trying to get ahead of the story

3560
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:52,927
Because he ends up playing it on his show me feel like he hit in my mind hears what he thinks is going to

3561
02:54:53,183 --> 02:54:53,695
Happened in court

3562
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:56,511
He's going to go to court he's going to play that video

3563
02:54:56,767 --> 02:55:02,911
And then he's going to play the video that was superimposed on it so you can see both of them playing side-by-side

3564
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:09,311
Beyond a shadow of a doubt that of course this one time stamp from 30 years ago could not be the same video and the jury will be

3565
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:11,615
Guilty

3566
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:14,687
Cuz there's no problem.

3567
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:18,271
Trying to get ahead of the story and here's the

3568
02:55:18,783 --> 02:55:24,671
Some of the funny things I've said over the air over the years I have some of this song before I think once

3569
02:55:26,207 --> 02:55:26,719
And

3570
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,767
So they put me over it

3571
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:31,583
It's my crime will probably go to federal prison for it everyday

3572
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:38,239
Booty booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere rockin everywhere

3573
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:43,103
Please Club

3574
02:55:47,711 --> 02:55:48,479
This is embarrassing

3575
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:54,879
Lexi's embarrassing we already got their first Carpe f****** donktum

3576
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:58,207
So embarrassed. Someone we got their first money

3577
02:55:58,463 --> 02:55:58,975
So

3578
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:01,791
On this episode where Rodger has been convicted

3579
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:04,863
Alex Spencer

Doing damage control about it meme

3582

Possibly hurt

3584
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:14,335
He's doing damage control

3585
02:56:15,103 --> 02:56:17,151
About something that can provide

3586
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:21,759
0 day only actually heard him in the court of public opinion

3587

About like more purity

3588
02:56:23,295 --> 02:56:23,807
Tyrannical

3589
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:25,087
Elementary

3590
02:56:25,599 --> 02:56:28,415
If you can search don't understand Greentree

3591
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:31,743
And if he's concerned about that that's all so tragic

3592
02:56:32,255 --> 02:56:33,791
I'm going to lose out on my donut

3593
02:56:34,303 --> 02:56:35,071
What about green screen

3594
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:42,239
Sonia said he talks to Tyler Nixon and and it's mostly just Rodger didn't do anything wrong he's being damned up I don't really care

3595
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:43,263
It's not really all that

3596
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:45,055
So I'm going to end

3597
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:45,823
On a call

3598
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:46,591
Metallica

3599
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:48,127
2nd episodes

3600
02:56:48,383 --> 02:56:49,151
Sometimes on upset

3601
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:52,479
Okay and this call is very much upset

3602
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:54,527
I know we all want to do things

3603
02:56:54,783 --> 02:56:55,807
Like I said I am

3604
02:56:56,063 --> 02:56:57,599
Hublot officer

3605
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:05,791
Tirehub everything and we've been legal and lawful and look what it's got us

3606
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:07,071
Trump into

3607
02:57:07,327 --> 02:57:08,607
Give us a second chance

3608
02:57:11,423 --> 02:57:16,031
But he is how he is allowed drug people like Rodger Stone and

3609
02:57:16,287 --> 02:57:18,847
Wikileaks and everything else to go on

3610
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:20,895
Caress to be

3611
02:57:21,663 --> 02:57:24,991
Have our hands tied behind our backs while we think we're in a fight

3612
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:26,527
What we're losing

3613
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:27,807
And it

3614
02:57:29,087 --> 02:57:32,927
Get hardcore this time to get extreme cuz we're losing our country

3615
02:57:34,463 --> 02:57:40,607
Trump will be impeached because look what they've done

3616
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:45,215
Rodger Stone

3617
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:50,847
Everything is falling apart

3618
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:56,735
We cannot speak anymore we've lost our country as you said today we live in clown

3619
02:57:58,015 --> 02:58:00,831
Now is the time to make a stand

3620
02:58:01,087 --> 02:58:04,927
I'm afraid we're not going to have a country to come home to

3621
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:09,023
Two references clown world of course a Neo-Nazi

3622
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:11,327
Yeah you know what

3623
02:58:11,839 --> 02:58:13,119
That could not be more f***** up

3624
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:14,911
We got a law enforcement

3625
02:58:16,447 --> 02:58:16,959
Music off

3626
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:18,239
And what

3627
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:19,263
Suggesting

3628
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:23,871
We tried doing this the legal way we've tried doing all that and it's not working we need

3629
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:24,895
Extreme

3630
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:28,479
The only conclusion you can take away from that is let's do a legal ship

3631
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:31,807
Yeah and if you listen to Alex's show what does that mean

3632
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:34,623
Well I generally think it means it's a reference to

3633
02:58:35,903 --> 02:58:37,439
Killing people

3634
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,511
Alright so if we pride

3635
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:42,303
All of our legal in

3636
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:44,607
Clearly what we need to do

3637
02:58:45,119 --> 02:58:46,911
It's figure out more legal in La Palapa

3638
02:58:47,935 --> 02:58:48,703
He's trying to say we need

3639
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:50,495
That we say we need to be more

3640
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:54,335
Creative with plausible law that's what he's describing dad

3641
02:58:56,639 --> 02:58:58,687
Active-duty law enforcement office

3642
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:02,015
With very

3643
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:05,087
Team Neo-Nazi ties be interested in violent

3644
02:59:05,599 --> 02:59:08,415
This is the part where it's really interesting

3645
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,951
Because I think that there is

3646
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:10,975
A dichotomy

3647
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:13,023
Play and I don't know how Alex

3648
02:59:13,535 --> 02:59:14,303
Possibly work

3649
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:16,607
And that is if there is this album

3650
02:59:16,863 --> 02:59:17,375
My tub is audien

3651
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:23,775
But it's like he's faced easy Rodger being convicted inside while it's time to get argon there is no hope

3652
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:27,615
Hope Trump isn't going to do it therefore it's time to shoot

3653
02:59:28,127 --> 02:59:30,431
And I don't know how you

3654
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:32,223
Suppress that urgent your audience

3655
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:34,271
He's built It Up Overtime

3656
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:37,855
Like it hate it Trump is our last hope if it doesn't work out then

3657
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:39,135
We have to go to the gun

3658
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,671
That sort of thing

3659
02:59:40,927 --> 02:59:43,231
Mainstay of his rhetoric for a long time

3660
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:45,023
What simultaneously

3661
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:45,791
You start to

3662
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:46,815
Like I don't think

3663
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:47,839
That's what Alex is

3664
02:59:48,095 --> 02:59:49,631
Experience his transition

3665
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:52,191
Because if he goes away from Trump

3666
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:55,519
It's not necessarily at least where I hear in this episode

3667
02:59:55,775 --> 02:59:58,335
I don't hear him being like calling for

3668
02:59:58,591 --> 03:00:00,895
Since Trump do it we got a f******

3669
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:02,175
Start civil war

3670
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:03,711
I think that his

3671
03:00:03,967 --> 03:00:04,991
Attempt to

3672
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:06,271
Focus on Hillary

3673
03:00:06,527 --> 03:00:07,551
His attempts to

3674
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:10,111
Serta read maneuver what he's doing

3675
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:12,927
It could lend itself to

3676
03:00:13,695 --> 03:00:14,719
More info War

3677
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,255
So you have that

3678
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:19,071
And then you have this element to the audience

3679
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:20,863
I don't know what you can do with it

3680
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,655
But it doesn't seem

3681
03:00:22,911 --> 03:00:23,935
Good this is

3682
03:00:24,191 --> 03:00:25,215
This is a

3683
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:26,751
That Colour

3684
03:00:27,775 --> 03:00:28,287
Very scary

3685
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:32,127
Because combine that with Alex

3686
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:33,151
Moving away from

3687
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:34,687
Anytime

3688
03:00:35,711 --> 03:00:37,759
Yo in in regards to Trump World

3689
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:40,319
That we now exist in

3690
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:42,111
We saw this

3691
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:43,391
Bubble up

3692
03:00:43,647 --> 03:00:44,671
In real time

3693
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:46,207
From

3694
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:46,975
This Love

3695
03:00:47,487 --> 03:00:48,255
On the right way

3696
03:00:48,767 --> 03:00:51,071
We don't get Trump if it doesn't

3697
03:00:51,327 --> 03:00:53,375
Bubble Up from down where we are right

3698
03:00:54,143 --> 03:00:55,935
This this desire for

3699
03:00:56,191 --> 03:00:57,471
Autocratic

3700
03:00:58,239 --> 03:00:59,007
Right

3701
03:00:59,263 --> 03:01:04,127
This kind of thing bubbling up from below now the idea of well we got a

3702
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:05,919
We can't be on Trump

3703
03:01:06,175 --> 03:01:08,991
We need to be anti whomever

3704
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:10,783
We're no longer on Trump

3705
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:12,319
We're no longer protected

3706
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:14,367
Combined with the we've lost come

3707
03:01:14,623 --> 03:01:15,135
Sleep Athens

3708
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:17,951
We need to start f****** guns out

3709
03:01:18,207 --> 03:01:19,487
All day

3710
03:01:19,999 --> 03:01:22,815
If that is kind of the new dichotomy that the

3711
03:01:23,071 --> 03:01:25,119
Conservative party wind up breaking into

3712
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:27,935
Some weird s*** going to go down

3713
03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:30,239
Yeah but I think you're already seeing this

3714
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:32,799
Like with the stuff with Nick Fuentes

3715
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:40,223
Turning Point events

3716
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:47,135
I think that's this is going to be real and that's one of the things I think is most

3717
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:50,463
Troubling about the possibility of Alex

3718
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:51,999
It will radicalize

3719
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:52,767
Further

3720
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:54,815
Yeah certain segments of his body

3721
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:57,375
Yeah and the direction that they are going to go is

3722
03:01:57,631 --> 03:01:58,143
Kind of

3723
03:01:58,399 --> 03:01:58,911
Expressed by the

3724
03:01:59,423 --> 03:02:00,959
Absolutely

3725
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:03,775
And so that it that's something

3726
03:02:04,031 --> 03:02:05,055
I never thought about this

3727
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:05,823
Before

3728
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:06,591
But

3729
03:02:06,847 --> 03:02:08,639
But I'm sure Alex hasn't either

3730
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:11,711
But there is a part of his turning on Trump that like

3731
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:12,991
Responsibility

3732
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:16,575
There is there if he doesn't do it the right way a lot of people

3733
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:18,367
Or at least your attic

3734
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:21,695
There is like a real possibility of like

3735
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:22,975
Real damage

3736
03:02:23,487 --> 03:02:26,303
Betrayed even by Alex

3737
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:27,071
Batman

3738
03:02:27,327 --> 03:02:28,095
That means

3739
03:02:28,607 --> 03:02:30,911
We don't even have Alex in the infowar anymore

3740
03:02:31,423 --> 03:02:32,191
It's just you and me

3741
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,983
Well there yet because if

3742
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:34,751
Trumpkin

3743
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:38,847
Be shown to be a traitor or whatever then

3744
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:39,871
Alex can

3745
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:46,015
And where you go from there what you choose to take as like

3746
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:47,551
A good sorcerer

3747
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,087
That stuff is

3748
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:49,855
Struggling

3749
03:02:50,111 --> 03:02:52,671
It's troubling to think how you could go like what's worse

3750
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:55,231
And that's what you would end up doing Daddy's

3751
03:02:55,999 --> 03:02:56,511
I mean it

3752
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:59,327
It's very predictable this going.

3753
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:01,119
By the way it has

3754
03:03:01,375 --> 03:03:02,911
When you figure

3755
03:03:04,447 --> 03:03:06,239
Power structures in the right-wing have always

3756
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:08,287
Sing to co-opt

3757
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:09,311
Lower

3758
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:11,103
Distracting them with rice

3759
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:11,871
Jason cultural issue

3760
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:13,407
Shoes until 1 until 4 at the door.

3761
03:03:14,175 --> 03:03:14,687
To do all this s***

3762
03:03:14,943 --> 03:03:17,247
And by being able to channel that rage

3763
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:18,783
They've been able to exist

3764
03:03:19,039 --> 03:03:20,575
State of minority rule

3765
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:22,111
F****** forever

3766
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:23,391
And now the rage is

3767
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,671
Kind of getting out of there

3768
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:25,439
Control

3769
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:27,231
And they don't know how to react

3770
03:03:27,999 --> 03:03:29,279
Cuz half of them are that race

3771
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:32,607
You know the power structure used to just be people controlling it

3772
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:34,399
And now half of my are just

3773
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:35,679
This crazy is everybody else

3774
03:03:35,935 --> 03:03:42,079
So I don't know why it's not

3775
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:43,103
It is predictable

3776
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:44,895
I have no idea what's going to happen

3777
03:03:45,407 --> 03:03:46,431
But it's inevitable

3778
03:03:46,687 --> 03:03:50,527
That we would get to this point yeah thanks just fractioning of

3779
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:51,551
Stuffies

3780
03:03:51,807 --> 03:03:57,951
Inevitable group only gets smaller

3781
03:03:58,207 --> 03:03:59,487
Yeah and it's troubling

3782
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:00,511
What

3783
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,535
Could happen

3784
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:02,559
As a

3785
03:04:03,071 --> 03:04:05,375
Alex if he doesn't do it right

3786
03:04:05,887 --> 03:04:06,911
And I honestly think

3787
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:07,679
Bringing back

3788
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:09,471
Bring back Larry

3789
03:04:09,727 --> 03:04:13,311
And having Joel skousen have a more prominent position in the show

3790
03:04:13,567 --> 03:04:17,407
Answer that is Alex trying to maneuver getting away for

3791
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:19,967
I think it's incredibly responsive

3792
03:04:20,223 --> 03:04:23,551
I hate to say it

3793
03:04:23,807 --> 03:04:24,575
We will

3794
03:04:24,831 --> 03:04:26,367
Upon

3795
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:34,303
That is a way to sort of neutralize some of that having to give Alex a kudos

3796
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:37,119
Probably accident

3797
03:04:37,631 --> 03:04:39,167
And it's same way

3798
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:40,447
Sort of

3799
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:41,471
Doing it

3800
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:44,543
I hate Trump

3801
03:04:45,055 --> 03:04:47,615
It's not like a violent

3802
03:04:47,871 --> 03:04:49,919
He's also more responsible

3803
03:04:50,175 --> 03:04:51,711
Then as a is a

3804
03:04:51,967 --> 03:04:53,503
Snapping of a twig

3805
03:04:53,759 --> 03:04:56,319
Where you just freak out and scream at Trump

3806
03:04:56,831 --> 03:04:58,879
The gradual disillusionment

3807
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:01,183
Might be a much softer Landing

3808
03:05:01,695 --> 03:05:02,719
In some ways you would help

3809
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:05,279
But whatever the case I mean I hate to make predict

3810
03:05:05,791 --> 03:05:06,303
Cuz I'm always wrong

3811
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:07,583
We'll see what happens

3812
03:05:08,095 --> 03:05:09,631
I guess the biggest problem I have

3813
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:11,679
The way that

3814
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:14,751
Hillary with it

3815
03:05:16,799 --> 03:05:17,311
And so on and so

3816
03:05:17,567 --> 03:05:18,335
Beaufort so now

3817
03:05:18,847 --> 03:05:19,359
It's

3818
03:05:19,615 --> 03:05:20,383
It's very much that

3819
03:05:21,407 --> 03:05:24,223
We everybody gets disillusioned with the

3820
03:05:25,247 --> 03:05:27,807
Yeah everybody winds up thinking that politics

3821
03:05:28,063 --> 03:05:28,575
Going to be able to

3822
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:30,367
Singing that it fails you in

3823
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:31,391
Subway

3824
03:05:31,647 --> 03:05:32,159
The system

3825
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:33,439
It's designed that way

3826
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:35,231
But whenever

3827
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:37,023
Did guy that you have

3828
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:37,791
Touted as

3829
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:39,071
The last guy

3830
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:43,167
Turns out to disillusion you why bother with

3831
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:45,727
Why bother with

3832
03:05:45,983 --> 03:05:47,519
That'll last guy is nothing

3833
03:05:47,775 --> 03:05:49,311
That's no disillusionment become

3834
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:52,383
Despair

3835
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:54,431
Despair in the hands

3836
03:05:54,943 --> 03:05:56,991
Of people who are

3837
03:05:57,503 --> 03:05:58,271
Let's say

3838
03:05:58,527 --> 03:06:00,319
Inclined towards militias

3839
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:02,879
The worldview that that

3840
03:06:03,647 --> 03:06:04,927
Yeah expressed by these

3841
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:08,511
Communist propaganda the Legacy

3842
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:11,583
Includes the Turner Diaries

3843
03:06:12,863 --> 03:06:14,911
That kind of Despair is weaponized

3844
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:15,679
Really easy

3845
03:06:16,447 --> 03:06:17,215
O'Reilly's

3846
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:20,287
Weaponizer the right word it becomes a weapon really

3847
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:22,847
And so I hope that that's not bad

3848
03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:24,639
Anyway I think that's the Big Dipper

3849
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:25,407
Between

3850
03:06:25,919 --> 03:06:27,199
When we got

3851
03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:28,479
Faced with this kind of

3852
03:06:28,735 --> 03:06:30,015
Despair we started a

3853
03:06:33,855 --> 03:06:36,159
So I don't know we'll see what happens in the future

3854
03:06:36,415 --> 03:06:40,511
And it's really interesting to see this is how Alex respond

3855
03:06:42,047 --> 03:06:46,655
Narratively and also like he was sure he was going to get found guilty

3856
03:06:46,911 --> 03:06:47,935
So there's no like real

3857
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:53,311
Surprised there's no need for a freak out necessarily

3858
03:06:54,079 --> 03:06:55,871
Non-normal Alex yelling

3859
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:58,175
Freak out is when someone didn't have a

3860
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:00,735
Story

3861
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:02,783
Goodwill Special Report going problems

3862
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:05,855
So I mean I think that's really interesting

3863
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:06,879
We'll see what happens

3864
03:07:07,135 --> 03:07:08,415
But for now we have

3865
03:07:08,671 --> 03:07:10,207
