1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
What's up if you went to a family reunions yesterday

3
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
Yeah boy

4
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
Yeah don't talk about it

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,304
Cut through this stupid fit that we do at the beginning of human

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
Member of my family you don't know anything about Alex

7
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,200
That's exactly how it went

8
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
I've been perfectly honest with you

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
Adventure

10
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
For the last couple days I noticed I had but I bought Saint Austin

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
This is finally coming in the mail since they're too

12
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
Big to be taken on a plane

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
Just wanted to put that up to the universe

14
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
Despite

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,712
How do you feel about that

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Arwen

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm being attacked

18
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Expired by now

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,976
You should have gotten it about a year-and-a-half before it expires

20
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
We have delightful show

21
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Before we do

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
I feel like I want to throw a wrench into the gears

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,920
Look for ways to expand on what this show is

24
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Is all about

25
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,112
Really I doubt it is driving me

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
I'm so I have here a habanero pepper

27
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm going to eat this

28
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Wow

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
I allow you to take over the show

30
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
What now throw the show into your hands those are the people who our new policy wants then I give a shout out to

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
I've never eaten habanero before I have no idea how I'm going to respond to that genuinely

32
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
I have no idea what's about to happen all right

33
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Anyway he would go Jordan take over the show

34
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Eating a habanero pepper right now

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
That's our new donors ladies and gentlemen

36
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Our first new donor

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,592
We would like to give a huge shout-out to Peter welcome to the policy wonks

38
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Don't do that right well then

39
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Swollen

40
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,528
I'm a policy wonk

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
And our next policy wonk has actually bumped up

42
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,232
Her donor Shadow just came from

43
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
She came straight in at the globalist level

44
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
Thank you very much Larissa

45
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
Someone sodomites

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,112
You threw a tiny wrench into the Giants

47
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Messer from

48
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
FernGully the first thought I had some way

49
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
I was weird

50
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,824
I don't know Jordan's going to enjoy this

51
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
I don't think you did and I give it a Beat

52
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
Really hurt by this yeah I expected to be like

53
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,720
You know I did not expect

54
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,351
Do you like spices things and spice like they fight

55
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
I would cry like a

56
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,775
Thresher in FernGully a guy and that's what I kind of like

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Where did

58
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,111
Opening of the show's becomes do

59
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Entrenched in this

60
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,487
Yeah little tiny bit

61
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
I don't think is going to work

62
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
For the curveball

63
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
We mix up a bit sound like we do the same bed every time

64
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,543
And now I know this is

65
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
Glycol

66
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
In Patriot mythology

67
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
Is it real

68
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,375
Very much out of contact

69
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
I just spoil

70
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
Call arifa

71
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
It's talking okay

72
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
That's it

73
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
Off the hook

74
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
But everything else Alex believes in

75
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Today Jordan we're going to be going over the

76
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
February 6th

77
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
February 10th episodes of The Alex Jones Show

78
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
2009

79
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
It's because there's a lot of dead air

80
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
There's a lot of downtime and we need to pick up the speed

81
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
We need to get to the point where the

82
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Party really kicks off

83
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
And we really get to see how long

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Take Alex

85
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
2 Chainz

86
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
From

87
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,991
All of those 2,000 positions into his

88
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,087
Much more in line with the Koch brothers

89
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
And so we need to

90
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
Need to get to do that

91
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
See how he responds to

92
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
The massive public

93
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Tea party stuff

94
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Tom and

95
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Is launching a new narrative

96
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Is really interesting it will carry through

97
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
The entirety of what we cover on

98
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
I'm going to guess

99
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Okay

100
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
The it's about the bees are dying

101
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
Because in 2009 was whenever that first started to get like it has been happening for like 10 years before that but

102
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
People started a really notice in 2009 they were like

103
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
Where are the there's going to be no food if we don't have bees

104
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
Did Alex Jones is going to jump on the back of that

105
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Like really

106
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
He's already said all he's going to say which is that

107
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
The bottom of the

108
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Here's where I think he's going to go with this

109
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
You first of all let me just

110
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
Stop before you go any further never been more right

111
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,463
I've got to go with

112
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
Complete turnaround for him

113
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
He is going to find the most

114
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Reasonable Acts

115
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Chemtrails

116
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Or the magnetic poles reversing

117
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
What he is going to say

118
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Is

119
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
I'm going to go with man-made climate change

120
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
And it's time to regulate the oil companies

121
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
In order to keep this from

122
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
I'm continuing

123
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
3 left field turn

124
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
Christian Franklin

125
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Play Aaron Franklin

126
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Going to say that the globalist

127
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Directions

128
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,919
Globalist

129
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
And growing

130
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Criminal

131
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Concentration camps

132
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
Increasing number of states declaring sovereignty

133
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Migos over it

134
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
A lot

135
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Not Justa

136
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Next hour

137
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
You know

138
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
In the history of our country

139
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Generally speaking

140
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
State legislators don't get together to say like

141
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,231
The law is the law federal government

142
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,815
But mysteriously a month or so after a black guy gets elected

143
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,911
A bunch of States get together and have their legislature put together

144
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
A bunch of bills

145
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,847
And resolutions that they put through that are directly to the president

146
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
I am the speaker of the house that just say

147
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Hey

148
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
You know

149
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
The law law

150
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Don't be encroaching

151
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Wait what

152
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
Yes

153
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
Legislators got together

154
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
What

155
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
They wrote a resolution and they mailed it to the speaker the house

156
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
Don't tread on me

157
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,871
Revolution

158
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
In the state houses

159
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Snogging

160
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Actual like Federal has

161
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
Representative

162
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
They would be sent to the president if they pass

163
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
It became

164
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Accepted resolution

165
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
But

166
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Is this

167
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Coordinate

168
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
These are all almost

169
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,495
Identical Resolute Revolution

170
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
I'm read them

171
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Almost all identical

172
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Things that are being operated by people who

173
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,991
May or may not show up on our episode today

174
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Yeah because they're weirdo Patriot assholes

175
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
Because all of these all of these bills are like actually written by the Heritage Foundation

176
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Are tired.

177
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
By the Heritage Foundation

178
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
Homemakers ever actually learned

179
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,663
It's 8 some patriots Bill Mill

180
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
And Franklin

181
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
So you can find Bill trackers

182
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
Stuff like that you can find out what happened

183
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
These resolutions

184
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
State that got introduced

185
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,679
Go to Sapphire nobody did it and nobody acted on it so it never got past and never got put through

186
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
The main one that Alex talks about cuz it was one that was introduced

187
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
I believe at least

188
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
But since I got four listen

189
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,759
I look that up and it turns out that the bill is listed as quote

190
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Legislate

191
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
What's up Billy what is inexpedient

192
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Arizona

193
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
VR the house resolution passed 34 224 but no black president

194
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
At the same time

195
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,151
Arizona

196
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
There's somebody went on record

197
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Is it only passed because

198
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
Obama

199
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
Cologne at a black person

200
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Yeah yeah

201
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,639
So it was then reintroduce as a resolution quote

202
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
Circulating Montana's rights under the US Constitution

203
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
And it once again failed

204
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Because everyone's like

205
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
You're saying

206
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,487
So Michigan diversion introduced

207
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
By the committee of government operations

208
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
My home state Missouri

209
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
This one's weird

210
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
Their version HR 212 was a little bit

211
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
It declares Missouri sovereignty under the 10th Amendment

212
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Does the United States Congress

213
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
To reject the past

214
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Did your federal

215
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
Freedom of Choice act which prohibits regulations on abortion

216
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,343
So they

217
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
They were like the law is the law

218
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
But at the same time

219
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
Please don't make any more laws

220
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,119
About abortion please Monster the 10th Amendment

221
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
Into this HR 212

222
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Missouri

223
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Missouri house

224
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
Zuri was like

225
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Because it was it was it covered too much

226
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
You know it was like

227
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
It was replaced with HR to United States

228
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,791
Which classifies abortion as a fundamental right

229
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
The law is the law and you got to remember that we're Missouri we are sovereign

230
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,343
The law is the law everybody likes

231
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
It appears that that's the case

232
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
294 does appear to have half the house

233
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
So

234
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
Alex will end up talking to the guy responsible for

235
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Oklahoma

236
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Crazy

237
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
I don't think you could not talk to

238
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,711
Any Arizona Montana all that's it boring

239
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma

240
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
I'm excited I want to hear this

241
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
Resolution

242
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
Which passed the house and the Senate

243
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
When was vetoed by Governor Brad because the language of the resolutions that Oklahoma

244
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Send back federal taxes

245
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,991
And he was like no I don't want to do nothing no one wants to do that

246
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
I will ruin

247
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
All of our budget

248
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
Governor we would like you to sign this bill

249
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
The name of witches

250
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
Shoot Oklahoma in the dick

251
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
Oklahoma

252
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Reduce to Bella's house

253
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,799
Current resolution 1028

254
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
It passed the damn house again although it's slightly diminished support probably because of the

255
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Brought up

256
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Because it was

257
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,623
Concurrent resolution it did not need to go to the governor this time

258
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Speaker of the House

259
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,583
All the bill was

260
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,143
Was it you could really boil it down to just

261
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
The two words

262
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Watch it

263
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
Or we got our eye on you

264
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
You better know that

265
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,687
It's really really hard to look at this and not see that

266
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
You know what I'm saying like it's it's

267
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
It's pretty much like

268
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Oh you guys are shook

269
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,695
You should have been the moment Obama's like

270
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
Really going to happen on this 18 years trying to reach across the aisle to

271
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
Being like

272
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
We're passing a vaguely races bill

273
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Indirect

274
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,551
Response to Obama being elected I know about the resolutions of this because we're years later

275
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
GameStop

276
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Comedian stuff like that

277
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
They happen in like

278
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
March and April 2009 we're at we're still in

279
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
There's a little bit of an omniscient narrator

280
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
You know that the reason neither being introduced

281
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Because

282
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
Anyway in the next

283
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
F****** weird I never really know what to say

284
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Expect from him

285
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
I know him well in many ways

286
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
Right but he still surprises me a serial killer

287
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
I didn't see em.

288
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
It seems like a decent

289
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,303
Guy I would say that

290
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Jarring

291
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
College

292
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,359
Grant

293
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Children is bad

294
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Panda

295
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
Ponzi scheme

296
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,951
Not security

297
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Another

298
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
This is not the part.

299
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Surprises I imagine.

300
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Right in line with his demographic shift

301
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
We're not having a baby

302
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Forgot

303
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
A population

304
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
Shorty got a few children hold on hold on

305
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,807
Hold on hold on

306
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
It was

307
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
Emeryville

308
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Too far

309
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
Blend

310
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
Whether it was a good decision or not

311
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
What does it matter

312
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
I don't I don't care I just hate bunnies

313
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
I don't care either but I don't know and I don't care

314
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Who's coming to bat for October

315
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Like knowing what we know

316
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,567
1414 East 7th

317
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Yeah you said it my man well

318
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
For me

319
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
Call Sue Metty

320
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't know what equatorial that's what I was

321
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
What is he mean by ecuatorial

322
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
I think near the equator

323
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,543
Of the world is there very fertile people from near the equator

324
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
He thinks she's actually a volcano

325
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
And she's in the Ring of Fire

326
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Notorious

327
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,111
Play fertile soil is incredible prone to explosions

328
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
I bought

329
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Still very firm

330
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
All I know is

331
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Excuse

332
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Races

333
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
It does

334
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Steals is racist

335
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
I don't know how

336
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,471
Because that's

337
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Remember when I

338
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Earlier said

339
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
He continues to surprise me

340
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
That's that's why

341
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
That feels

342
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Very

343
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,711
Very bigoted

344
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
Know how to put my finger

345
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
No it's wrong

346
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,391
It seems to me like someone who talks about like fiery Latino blood

347
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,976
And stuff like that right

348
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
I don't know

349
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,632
I do like the idea of him changing his rhetoric is like the West

350
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
The middle

351
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,520
The middle

352
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
You go all the way around it

353
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Center I'm going to go with the

354
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
10th to the 10th parallel

355
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,528
You might remember that a few years back Todd Akin

356
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
If a woman has

357
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Raped her at

358
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
It's pregnant

359
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,256
I'll take care of that

360
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,864
Best thing for Clay Aiken to say wish you was invisible

361
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Do that

362
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,896
If I were if I were invisible I would

363
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
So it is

364
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
To freising to remember that Alex wasn't like

365
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
He wasn't offended by

366
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
It's kind of like

367
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Seems like a reasonable comment

368
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Coronavirus

369
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
Out of it back to 2009

370
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
That's where we are

371
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,808
200%

372
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
Other forms of reproductive

373
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Flash

374
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Don't associate with breast cancer

375
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Why don't you have the baby in adoption

376
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Why don't you

377
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Glock dookie

378
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
Screaming really gross things

379
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
About abortion that are just like

380
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
His normal Mooyah

381
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:49,504
This is real this is very unscientific

382
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:55,136
Is it is it like

383
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
It's got to be something like if you are near them while they're menstruating

384
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
You'll become a woman like

385
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Doing

386
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
Self everything works out

387
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
There are no problem

388
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:25,344
50% of women used to die in childbirth until like 100 years ago

389
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Body work that out

390
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
No Doubt

391
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,096
That's how much do you have in October

392
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
Exactly that's a

393
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
There's that there's a question we need to ask ourselves

394
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Or more

395
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
If you said so

396
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
This idea of guilt

397
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
People about stuff

398
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Utter horseshit

399
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Literally

400
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
By his own beliefs

401
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,088
10 women cancer

402
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
Are you stupid it so he spends a lot of this show.

403
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Really gross things

404
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Fear tactic

405
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
It about abortion

406
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
It doesn't it doesn't pass the smell test

407
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Probably

408
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Comes from

409
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
Anti-abortion

410
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
That's probably

411
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Information

412
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
South Broadway

413
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
The Greener more familiar pastors

414
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Our old friend

415
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
The guy who

416
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Millions and millions

417
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,416
From South Africa

418
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
The outcome

419
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Financially

420
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Will be all the currencies will collapse

421
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Evaluation

422
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,360
Almost all of them will do directly to be a futile do okay

423
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Which one

424
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
In the meantime every single day

425
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
Every single currency

426
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Is the valuing against against

427
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
So

428
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Eden Spa

429
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
If I really but it is just

430
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
It is just on to say all this stuff about how like

431
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
There's an artificial collapsed

432
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
All current

433
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Google

434
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Inflation's going to go ballistic

435
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,872
$900 at 1 $10 gold

436
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Gold is going over $3,000

437
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
And if you don't

438
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
If you have

439
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,648
About having that defensive insurance position at home

440
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
You've got to get more coins

441
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
You've got to get more silver

442
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Anything

443
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
Again

444
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Next week is going to fly

445
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Next week

446
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
It's going to fly

447
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
You better by shiting now

448
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
Never hit

449
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
3030

450
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
I will say that gold was right

451
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Around this time

452
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
It never reached

453
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
The levels that they are saying

454
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
It's going to

455
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Gaining value

456
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
It's falling and there

457
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Pretending

458
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,336
Right it did it

459
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,664
A little bit later up

460
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
10:00

461
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
Torso

462
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Corrected

463
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Pretty much sense with

464
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
With a little bit of fluctuation

465
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Right around 11:12

466
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
Because that's evil

467
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
They're doing that maliciously

468
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
And it was still for a time a good investor

469
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Will you call like that

470
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,192
You can be a liar about the big picture

471
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
Correct

472
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
About

473
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Detail

474
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Kermit play that is a bummer

475
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,736
It is to be all alive and unfortunately

476
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
It's not

477
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,856
Trying to scare you with isn't true

478
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
But the idea that like at that time if you'd bought gold

479
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
You could have made some money if

480
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
If you got out at the right time

481
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
You know that's not

482
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
We've never said that that's not true

483
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,216
No it's actually generally always been largely

484
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
A lot of cryptocurrencies

485
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,616
But if you are able to ride them correctly

486
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
You can make money on

487
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,016
A lot of people but it's just there like

488
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
More examples

489
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
All the people who go

490
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Get the fraud

491
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Or

492
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
End up blowing

493
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
And silver buyers resources

494
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Is Reno from

495
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Copious amounts of

496
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Rip off

497
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Reports on chat like that

498
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
They were getting screwed having nothing to do with

499
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
The price of gold

500
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
So that's that's

501
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Anderson pops up

502
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Zug is a spackle

503
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
Sovereigns are hot

504
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,416
I have a hard time realizing I don't think I've ever asked a question

505
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
What

506
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,816
It's so he doesn't sell golite of everytime I hear he sells gold

507
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
I imagine little bars

508
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,264
That's what I every time you said that

509
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
Because a proper size bar of gold

510
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Exercised

511
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
No that's what it's called

512
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,744
Mostly coins

513
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
That have a certain amount of gold content

514
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
Okay so generally British sovereign

515
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,056
Dimes that have silver content in them

516
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
From

517
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
I don't know how much how many

518
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,200
Currently up printed

519
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
But you have these like you can even still find some of them in

520
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
Circulation you can find like quarters

521
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
From McKnight

522
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,672
Want to hear something like that they don't have

523
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
A little bit of

524
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Silver Inn

525
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
From specific ears from back when

526
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
They had

527
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Silver Inn

528
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
He's going solo

529
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,032
One of his walking liberty half dollars or whatever will have

530
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
4000

531
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Oz

532
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,456
Gold in it or whatever

533
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,600
What how would you know because of that they're certify

534
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
When they were printed

535
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,464
Those were it like that was

536
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
How

537
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,352
The more

538
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Non

539
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Historical

540
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Coin

541
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,240
He has are ones that they make specific

542
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
This much gold

543
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
And then some filler

544
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,920
Evenflo gold coin

545
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Reselling

546
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:22,368
At all

547
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Whenever that was the way that it works

548
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
How could you trust that s***

549
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Who is doing the certifying

550
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
I don't know

551
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,096
Currency is always been Magic

552
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,216
Rosie has always been a faith-based

553
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
There's so mad about with the idea

554
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
Trusting the government

555
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Define to trust

556
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Local

557
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
Or the

558
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Centralized coin guy who's making

559
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,552
Coins for this whatever

560
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
The point of the show

561
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Happen

562
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm at is Alex Jones has

563
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Watson

564
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Paul Joseph Watson

565
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Brother

566
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,984
What I've never heard Paul Joseph Watson on the show in 2009

567
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
And now I hear Steve Watts

568
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
And boy

569
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
He is not ready for primetime

570
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
He is boring

571
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,064
Has not been on the show but I haven't heard yet

572
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
So far he's not popped up

573
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
He's definitely around but he's writing

574
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
But Alex hasn't forced him on air yet

575
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
A b t w

576
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Comes on

577
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Man if I can't

578
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Imagine

579
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
He's on Everett

580
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
He's so boring

581
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
He is just

582
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Disaster

583
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
And I have a working Theory this is my dick

584
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
He looks a lot

585
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,136
I think you might not exist what happened with Alex introduced

586
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
As like

587
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
I think

588
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
Did Paul Joseph Watson or Steve Wilkos Olympia

589
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
D Watson yes I decided that he wanted to pay checks never come to English

590
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
Brother persona

591
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Push them all

592
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
So Steve

593
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
The Persona comes on and it's just awful

594
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
You never comes back on

595
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Does a little bit of like

596
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Little bit of work

597
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Little bit

598
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
He's training

599
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
It's a little bit better get a little snarky

600
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,024
Getting that glassy eye thing going through looks like he means everything you say

601
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
Stronger than ever alright never shows back up on air call Joseph

602
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
Takes the mantle out of the Watson

603
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
And now Steve Fades into the background much like Paul Joseph Watson

604
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Appears to be in 2009

605
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
That's my theory I have nothing to base that on

606
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Except for a picture that I saw Steve

607
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:59,552
Watson who looks very sick also

608
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
A long way to go

609
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
I'm going to be honest with you I'm leaving toward that theory more than I am that Paul has a brother I've got to amuse myself somehow I listen

610
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
Paul has a brother whose exactly is crazy as hell

611
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Yeah probably

612
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,056
Score in the early days they got on the same page about we can make

613
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
The money off this

614
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,736
Does he have a does he have the same Posh British

615
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
Center is he like a

616
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Does he have

617
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Lowe's

618
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
It's low energy

619
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,024
Just because

620
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
What timezone

621
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Because now I'm thinking

622
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
Paul Joseph Watson

623
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
But just hams it up with a Dick Van Dyke

624
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Kind of

625
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Cockney I

626
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,456
He doesn't do that enough voices that I believe they're from the same

627
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
In my area

628
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
So boring

629
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
And awful and we are going to go

630
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Surprise

631
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Nobody

632
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Questions

633
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
How does a box

634
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
What's what's in the box

635
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,600
How does that work so what's in the box

636
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:49,120
Individual

637
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216

638
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800

639
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
What's it about

640
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Tyler

641
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,944
Water filters

642
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
So sweet

643
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
Boring interview with one of the sponsors

644
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,976
Anderson

645
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Is justice

646
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
Subsidiary arm of

647
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Wholesale

648
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,496
Soap Limerick guy on all the time

649
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
Water filter

650
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Response Iran as a guest

651
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
It's clear he has to do this it's cleared there's some sort of a brokering of like you sponsor my show and

652
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
I'll let you come on in spots

653
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,832
Now great this guy doesn't say anything that's like as funny as a liberal

654
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Or anything like that

655
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
Disappointing but it is

656
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
Infomercial Alex's offering

657
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Infomercial space

658
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
He's bucking desk

659
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
He's not doing well

660
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
2009

661
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Guarantee that number of

662
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,752
Bob Chapman coming to be like next week

663
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
Gold prices are skyrocketing. Only function of that is to be like Buy It Now

664
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,808
I'll do an infomercial for the water sponsor maybe you get a couple extra bucks from him whatever

665
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,880
Towards the end of the show Alex decides like

666
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Transitioning

667
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Imma take some

668
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
And they're all pretty boy

669
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
But this one caller says

670
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
I want to send send you a my thing I can't find your address anywhere on that little what is wrong with your site why is

671
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,544
An abortion is an abortion I cannot

672
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
Find anything because

673
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
You have all the stuff I don't mind having the advertising

674
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,736
But the rest of the space that you have like little blocks a little segments

675
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,344
So we can go to whatever segment of the site we want to do tonight

676
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
And I go berserk trying to find simple things

677
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,568
Your website sucks

678
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
Dude get some f****** web design going

679
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
I don't think I don't like it

680
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't like to change your voice I'm still going to listen anyways

681
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
I don't know

682
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,264
Well you told Alex that he needs

683
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Changes website

684
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
It's in.

685
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Maybe you'll change

686
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
So that ends the 6th that's a Friday show

687
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Navigate to the 8th

688
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Nathan

689
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Disaster

690
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,856
It's mostly just in reading a bulshit article by Kurt Nimmo

691
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,720
To really go into and then a lot of episode also is about again

692
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Declaring their sovereignty

693
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
You've already started

694
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Disgust

695
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
The only thing I

696
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
My ears perked

697
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
At all

698
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
Now why Wisconsin try to join them

699
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
Chicot power imaginary kontrolfreek every nobody

700
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,536
You can't build a business you can't run a company

701
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
They're all little uniform

702
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,888
On power trips Valdese roid head cops

703
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
Who been in Iraq confiscating guns killing 1.3 million

704
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
They're all coming home to America

705
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
To drink our country

706
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Okay

707
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,992
So that's very is I troops

708
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
I feel I feel like

709
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,392
From his perspective what he's trying to

710
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
BB customer-facing

711
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
Persona

712
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,048
The idea of like yeah we're going down but they're getting hurt

713
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
To probably isn't

714
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,216
That's not good that's not like that's not in line with what he wants his listeners to think right I mean

715
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Yeah that sounds right

716
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
Well yeah but you don't f*** that you don't want that presentation

717
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
Absolute I have a working.

718
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,976
His dad just would have made him feel smart

719
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,328
Difficult route

720
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,824
Fascism has a login

721
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,408
Alex Jones dad would have

722
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Weird

723
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
My perception

724
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
The downfall of America

725
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
That's a good boy

726
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,488
That's a weird way to the beauty

727
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
February 9th

728
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,352
2009 is also kind of not

729
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Much

730
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
There's not much going on on that show

731
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,520
Illustrate how little I think is going on

732
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
The only thing

733
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
I think it's worth mentioning

734
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
Isn't that this is the first time I've heard this

735
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Theme music

736
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
That I think is one of the most out of

737
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,320
Place things ever on Alex's show this

738
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
Who's the first time

739
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,864
More more

740
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
The real quick will get back to the cliff but like

741
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
He's using it as a coming in from commercial where is

742
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
Always going out

743
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
So now it's

744
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Figure this could go like

745
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,503
As a soft reminder that it's time for a commercial break but coming in

746
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Is jari

747
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,695
Engineering

748
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:12,095
AR testing how covered up the media house

749
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
Watchdog group

750
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,383
What he said

751
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,855
Engineered mosquitoes where you

752
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:40,511
Sounds like it was from Final Fantasy

753
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
Compose that right it's so mellow

754
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
Zelda dungeon

755
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
You know it's like an underwater level in.

756
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
It's very weird

757
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,831
He's working off this really

758
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Understand

759
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,927
Anna Gunn article that you read about settlements

760
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Mosquitoes

761
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Low mosquito drones being able

762
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,095
I like it

763
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
People is

764
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,727
Absurd because being able to make something

765
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
Small enough that they would be

766
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
Largely undetected and be able to fly around and

767
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:31,199
That people was actually able to have like

768
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,831
One person worth of adult that's a milliliter

769
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
Yes pretty big

770
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Just like the

771
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
The energy capacity that it would need to fly around the middle of

772
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
Diculous

773
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,751
The people have gone on record in specified like that technology

774
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Cost-prohibitive

775
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
It doesn't exist

776
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,151
No one would be motivated towards creating it

777
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
Why not

778
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
Vaccines that you need like a flu vaccine

779
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:16,767
Seeing or mmri never liked require subdermal

780
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,119
Injection summer subcutaneous

781
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Didn't you

782
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
Tubi

783
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:29,311
Like specifically able to make specific injections

784
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
It's just it's

785
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,943
The craziest idea

786
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
Because if

787
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,671
I mean what you would have is you have to have someone operating

788
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,535
Someone flying around a little tiny mosquito with a milliliter

789
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,167
Worth of what do you think the Nintendo switch was invented for it that's what it's all about

790
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Pixelmon with his ML and then you have to go back to

791
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
The HomeBase

792
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,847
It's just going to be lost

793
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:09,247
This little mosquito drone is going to be lost in the field which happens if mosquitoes

794
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,087
I thought you're out a million dollars

795
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
It doesn't really work

796
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,743
There's a lot of like sort of just a fundamental question

797
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
Asking about

798
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
Technologies

799
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
Arizona

800
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
Iraq

801
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
If you had that kind of a drone

802
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,359
Precise way about

803
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
Worried about what

804
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Because

805
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,111
Almost the time

806
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Propeller

807
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
How are you doing this

808
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,231
You have to worry about like

809
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
It doesn't work that way

810
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
Really

811
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,191
Is just putting a little robot right out of mosquito

812
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Can't do that

813
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Lyrics to worry about

814
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,079
Humidity will be just like there's so many factors

815
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Involved

816
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Just make us like

817
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:12,223
Bill Gates

818
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Omnipod

819
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
This one is not

820
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
Different track

821
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,927
Alright you build a giant mosquito

822
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Robot

823
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Shrink it down

824
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
I'm nodding so you got

825
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,959
That's the start

826
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,031
No doubt about that

827
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,359
Possible

828
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
No

829
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
I got involved in a invention

830
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,367
Background

831
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,255
Cool that would clean BBQ Grill

832
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
Cuz there's a bunch of different things that you need like

833
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,311
Exhausted all right but I made a prototype of this

834
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Mulch

835
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,151
Repurpose tool for cleaning BBQ grills

836
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Entered it in this

837
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
Exchange

838
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
And I lost

839
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,855
And I gave you a mosquito as a reward

840
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,439
To this girl is hypothetical

841
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,999
Shrink and expand

842
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
Proof-of-concept was a Hershey

843
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:42,591
You would do it it would hit the Loray and then it would turn into that

844
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,223
Willy Wonka

845
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Maybe.

846
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
She is she's just she called it to my TV

847
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,671
I'm still mad about this

848
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,839
That was a proof-of-concept

849
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Smith

850
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,911
Alright well I'm still alone

851
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
How did she do

852
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,287
No I mean like later on in life how's your drink right well I lost track

853
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,847
You lost track

854
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Mosquito Tek

855
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Alright

856
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Well that's good

857
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,735
Who's winning that contest

858
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
Held her that gave her the self-confidence necessary

859
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
To pursue a career in giant mosquito

860
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Technology

861
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
You're trying to step in the way

862
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
Don't make me most.

863
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
Is that like I'm sure

864
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
She doesn't even remember

865
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,423
Not even a memory for her.

866
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,103
What could have been if I had just won that contest

867
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
We move on

868
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
To February 10th

869
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
Here's where

870
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Fairly interesting

871
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,111
And Alex says about to release

872
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,743
Getting back on his bulshit a little bit

873
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Saying gross things about abortion

874
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Yeah I only kept

875
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Because

876
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
I've tried to find

877
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
Pacific Ace he's talking about and I can't

878
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Just don't

879
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
Mainstreet news story about

880
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,151
Abortion clinics

881
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
Partial birth

882
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,231
Exposure

883
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
Cockroaches chewing on it

884
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
Handle it

885
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,759
So I looked for this read the original article how would they find it did you linked to

886
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:04,159
I'm not disputing that there might be some sensationalize bulshit article

887
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
I haven't found it

888
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
But I did look into all this

889
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
You know there is a lot of it

890
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
To the babies in dumpster

891
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Stuff like that

892
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
Dumpsters

893
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
Most of the time

894
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
If you look

895
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Stories

896
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
They are not abortion

897
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,055
They are people who have the baby and want to keep it secret

898
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
Whether it's an abusive

899
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Spouse

900
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
Abusive

901
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
The partner

902
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,711
Or just like a I don't want to deal with this

903
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Kind of situation

904
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Generally speaking

905
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,319
In the same way that when he talks about like

906
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
Kids being Captain k

907
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,439
I'm stopped right but like in terms of

908
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
Pedophile networks are keeping kids

909
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
When you look at

910
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
Sometimes the kids have been found in cages

911
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
It's almost always the parent

912
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,031
The stories that I kept finding when I looked into this and tried to

913
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Dig it up I don't even want to talk about

914
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Horrifying

915
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,407
Gross people who

916
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
Head

917
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
They didn't

918
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:05,343
Take care of it they got no I don't know why even these articles a lot of the time say

919
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,975
It's unclear why they didn't deal with it yeah but then they end up having the baby at home

920
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Thrown in dumpster

921
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
Like as if that is going to deal with the issue

922
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,399
It was like a sorority

923
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
College student

924
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
And she had the baby

925
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Her bathroom

926
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
And then put it in a trash bag and threw it in the dumpster

927
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
And I texted her boyfriend

928
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
No baby

929
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
So like

930
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,503
Wow no more baby or something like that

931
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,855
To the extent that I didn't find like a police report on this

932
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,695
Also I'm going to take this with a grain of salt

933
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
But I think it was like a new Republic

934
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
It's not like

935
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,095
It's not like some place that makes up

936
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,679
Things whole cloth

937
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,239
Yeah I like that but yeah

938
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
It's going to be

939
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
You have stuff like this

940
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
Do you have stuff like

941
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,175
You know Kermit Gosnell

942
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
That's a doctor who was cutting up babies

943
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:10,111
And stuff like that that's not a story about abortion being a problem that's a story of a

944
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,695
Do you have a couple of instances like this

945
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Confine

946
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Analysis

947
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
As best I can tell he's trying to

948
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
To turn

949
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
The

950
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
The fear of the reality of people like Gosnell

951
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
And these

952
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
People who do this

953
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
This to their own child

954
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
And apply that

955
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Two abortions

956
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:36,479
It's it's

957
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
Problem is what

958
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
He described

959
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
Is a cartoon

960
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:47,231
2nd and the door gets locked behind

961
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
Flying out

962
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,143
And it's sliding around on the floor while other nurses

963
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,959
Anything quick

964
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:02,335
Across the room like a greased Pig and then it dies of exposure

965
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,991
Ladies around with billy club

966
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Youtooz just like

967
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
That's what I'm saying it sounds like they're people with hammers like they're always just people with big phone

968
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Mallets are at an abortion clinic like

969
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:36,639
Well it depends if the baby comes flying out of there we got to be we got to have backup for this abortion I would say

970
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
70s

971
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
Especially Horsham clinic

972
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
Pretty keenly aware

973
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
People want to kill them

974
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,951
I generally take today

975
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,999
Much more aware

976
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
Even if you wanted to

977
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,887
Do what we just were sarcastically discussing guys like

978
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,959
A possibility

979
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,775
I think I think of a Go Far More by the book

980
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
And that's why whenever these things come out by like

981
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Zookies

982
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,895
For the Center for Medical progress

983
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
It's always

984
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,735
Crazy edited videos

985
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
And it's always

986
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
Outright manipulation

987
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,647
To try and make these people look like they're doing the thing

988
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,695
They want their listeners to

989
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
Afraid that they're doing

990
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
So

991
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,191
Long-held belief that

992
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,615
I like I like it because there's nothing you can do there's no amount of Purity that you can

993
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,991
They're going to portray you as what they want to do matter what

994
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,783
Like don't even is like what

995
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
Who gives a s*** like

996
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:53,439
Obama never had a chance

997
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
Would never have given him a shot

998
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
It'd be so great if you do

999
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Just like

1000
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,167
Suck my balls on the table

1001
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,239
That's my issue with liberals

1002
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,543
We don't swing Ardex on the table

1003
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,895
Conservative swing their dicks all around I think it's fine for

1004
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,967
I am coming around to your position a little bit more

1005
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Clarification

1006
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
Like in terms of

1007
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
Versus

1008
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Like what is the right

1009
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,023
Decorum

1010
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
I don't I don't

1011
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,607
It's wrong to scream at

1012
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Anybody who's involved with Trump

1013
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:38,495
I never did

1014
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
Be at the line that I had for a

1015
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
The longest time was like

1016
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,711
Well we are going to have to eventually figure this out and eventually we're going to

1017
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
To have to work

1018
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
He's out and eventually

1019
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,575
There are people who are

1020
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,879
Conservative who are come from

1021
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Positioning

1022
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
We should not

1023
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
Abused

1024
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Abused

1025
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Persuasion

1026
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
Time goes on

1027
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,959
The last unless I hear any of those horses

1028
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
Right the more it becomes

1029
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
I'm very clear to me

1030
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,847
That's our priority is the people whose

1031
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Existence is in jeopardy

1032
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
You go ahead and

1033
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,015
Go ahead and take the service of the Broad Run

1034
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,391
Baby 6-9 months ago I kind of scared a little bit about the idea of like

1035
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Let's be fair to people

1036
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,975
And not put them in these groups

1037
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Especially with that

1038
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
TV's polls

1039
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Conservative

1040
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Like

1041
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Supporting every

1042
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Well

1043
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
This

1044
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,735
Lowe's 20% or whatever that are on board

1045
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,575
But f*** you because the other 60% is

1046
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Kill my friend

1047
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
That's not cool

1048
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,975
Just always goes back to life

1049
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
Think about who's standing around

1050
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,095
When you're at a rally

1051
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Look around

1052
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
Do you want to be at that rally

1053
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
And if you are one of the 20% of conservatives is like

1054
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,591
But I'm still calling myself a conservative

1055
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Go fuc yourself

1056
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
Music classic thing of like

1057
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Like if you're cool hanging out with nausea

1058
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Because you are enough

1059
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
There's not a thin line.

1060
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
There's no line at all you just are

1061
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
Yep

1062
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,447
Washington Post article that was about the

1063
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,519
That's my new my new show it'll be on a.m.

1064
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
Starbucks at I mean

1065
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,943
Walking potok

1066
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Strong

1067
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,999
Sarah Huckabee Sanders should not have been kicked out

1068
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,583
I agree with you is that Nazis are bad

1069
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,375
We need to

1070
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,983
Of all the things to care about right now

1071
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,103
What's Sarah Huckabee Sanders is allowed to do I don't give a fuk I don't give a fuk

1072
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,919
Even if I agreed with

1073
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,199
In the longer sense

1074
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,015
We'll get to that later dude

1075
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,927
Whenever all of this s*** is behind

1076
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
But

1077
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,255
Then we can talk about decorum

1078
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,655
Let's bail bonds

1079
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
That conversation

1080
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,775
Is even like a disservice to the reality of the world

1081
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
Even the civility conversation that

1082
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Seems to be happening on

1083
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
The internet

1084
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
I think even that is like

1085
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
We should just

1086
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Reject like we shouldn't even

1087
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,343
You didn't even have those sorts of Articles just hard pass no thank you

1088
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,183
It's just a

1089
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,743
Diamond all seem to boil.

1090
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
From the right

1091
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
Responses to

1092
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,351
Sarah Huckabee Sanders not being allowed to eat

1093
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
Eat at this restaurant

1094
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Seem to be that like

1095
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Your actions

1096
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,639
Are different than you being apart of

1097
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,687
Civil Rights Act

1098
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,783
How many

1099
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,391
And we're not bothering anybody

1100
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
And got married and would like to take for that

1101
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,703
The jail all the time all the time

1102
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,519
Did you see that video of George

1103
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Peterson

1104
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
Being interviewed by Jim

1105
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
Jim Jefferies

1106
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,127
I heard about it though

1107
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,199
It's basically just Peter does

1108
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
Libertarian

1109
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,087
Just brings up the idea of the Civil Rights Act is like

1110
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,903
Okay so based on the argument

1111
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Businesses

1112
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Shouldn't be able to serve

1113
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
Black people if they don't like

1114
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
All day all

1115
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,351
Basically waffle

1116
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,727
They all just fall apart in the fact that Jim Jefferies brings this up Jordan Peterson

1117
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Have you like

1118
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
I might be wrong

1119
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,199
What the f***

1120
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,503
How did you not think of

1121
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:44,159
And the fact that it was

1122
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
Disastrous

1123
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
How dare you

1124
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
You need to go on hiatus

1125
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,655
Like this is the intellectual version of like

1126
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
I got to go to rehab

1127
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:00,287
Got to go to rehab perfect perfect

1128
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
Analogy

1129
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Got in trouble got a little too

1130
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,199
To Buckwild one night and then like alright

1131
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
I don't want everyone to hate me

1132
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
I'm going to rehab

1133
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
Go away

1134
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
Film Iron Man

1135
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,719
That's what you got to do you got to go away to come back

1136
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
You're going to be huge

1137
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
With not being a homophobe

1138
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
Exactly

1139
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
So now

1140
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,263
We get to the next one

1141
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
On a lot of

1142
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Against his libertarian

1143
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Values

1144
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Yeah

1145
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,263
Hydrocodone and going home and

1146
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
Turn your lights out

1147
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
So that's a long pause.

1148
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
But I wanted

1149
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,255
Very easy

1150
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,839
I believe that Libertarians do believe that you have the right

1151
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
And your own life

1152
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
If you are in excruciating

1153
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:37,055
You have the right over your own body

1154
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
The of that

1155
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
No one stop

1156
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
Going to the dent

1157
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
Justin getting a ton of hydrocodone

1158
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
Is I'm pointing out okay in order for you to

1159
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Did you

1160
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,879
Who's willing to be your accessories

1161
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,463
In your suicide of yourself

1162
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,863
You need to conveniently dental surgery for that in a long hydrocodone

1163
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
Have you ever been to the gym already

1164
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,775
No matter what you're going to need a sister

1165
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,311
Somehow guaranteed to eat

1166
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
Getting that hydrocodone

1167
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,407
Or you're going to need Kevorkian

1168
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
You know like you need one of

1169
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,527
And there's no way around that

1170
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
We'll get to it

1171
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,135
During right now

1172
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
People want the right to die

1173
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
Then he says

1174
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,303
Well nobody's stopping you

1175
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,863
From finding a way to kill yourself

1176
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,423
His whole point is that like

1177
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,519
People who are arguing that like old

1178
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,823
You should be able to choose to die with dignity

1179
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Which I think is probably

1180
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
Believe that better way to fry

1181
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,991
Yeah those people that

1182
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
Food that's really bad

1183
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
And s*** like that

1184
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,207
Reject the premise

1185
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
You shouldn't the law.

1186
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
To come in

1187
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
And make it okay for someone

1188
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
To help you died

1189
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
Because that's just going to get other people

1190
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
Don't want to die killed

1191
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,031
Where is you should just be able to go

1192
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,335
Be able to

1193
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,359
Specifically

1194
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,663
Should just go to your dentist to get a bunch of pills

1195
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Rather than kill yourself

1196
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
Right or what do you suggest

1197
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,927
Close and turn the car on

1198
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,231
You want to kill yourself go ahead

1199
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,071
The whole point here is

1200
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Did they want to pass a law

1201
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,639
All those things killing people

1202
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:57,087
I do I RKO you

1203
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
I reject the premise

1204
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
Because

1205
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,327
Documentaries about people who choose to end their own life

1206
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Assisted suicide

1207
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,423
States that allow it

1208
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
Yeah I've seen something

1209
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
No no

1210
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:23,455
You had to go through like that

1211
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,503
You need a proof

1212
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:31,135
Psychological

1213
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,951
That they are deciding

1214
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
I have a disease

1215
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
Super painful

1216
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
And is going to

1217
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,935
To be a miserable experience to go through I would rather check out now when I can be around my loved one

1218
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,031
And what have you is so the idea that he's like now this is a slippery slope

1219
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,615
This cruel cruel

1220
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
The anger that he is

1221
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Expressing with

1222
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
You can't turn on the gas

1223
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
You can't turn on the gas

1224
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,879
That's really everybody else around kill blow up a house

1225
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
Did you just turn on your gas

1226
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
And then off yourself

1227
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,767
It's like if you were single person and there's no one to find

1228
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
Entire house with gas

1229
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Could blow up a block

1230
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
And then also the

1231
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Do that that exhausted your

1232
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
Your garage one

1233
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
You might kill your kid

1234
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
Stumble Inn

1235
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:28,991
There's Auntie pass out

1236
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
Possible there's a lot of

1237
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,063
There's a lot of real serious

1238
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:32,831
Problem

1239
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
With that like I did like

1240
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Here's how you do it

1241
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,207
Here's how you do it stopped

1242
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
Give you a

1243
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,303
Lethal injection that you

1244
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
Ask for around your loved ones

1245
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,423
Checkout noticeably absent

1246
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Dunce

1247
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Weather

1248
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,127
Like his vet

1249
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,271
Never know which is what I asked cuz I don't want to bring that up

1250
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
Almost

1251
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
14 lakh

1252
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,327
Because it is far as the law goes

1253
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,679
For me the law should just be like the f*** that noise

1254
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:25,055
Where do I go for cancer and you get to press the button that says f*** that noise

1255
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
Get on out

1256
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,175
You know like that kind of thing

1257
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,967
Go

1258
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
Like if you want to go

1259
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
Sleepily with drug

1260
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
If you want to

1261
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
I've been busy

1262
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,159
Is weird baby I'm going to

1263
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,207
Safari

1264
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:47,071
Scenarios for us if you want to

1265
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
I think you should be

1266
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,935
Thunder Lakers

1267
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
How to take drugs in

1268
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
Or maybe you're weird and you're last Moana

1269
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
You don't want that

1270
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Now yeah

1271
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Blacked out and safe

1272
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:14,719
Like because of the drug maybe the last moment with your family is you think I would type

1273
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:20,863
The Green River Killer

1274
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:28,543
That I would even want to leave out the mystery you might be super high on whatever those death

1275
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,127
Drugs are French

1276
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,711
Then I'll tell him I got you

1277
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:41,087
No I can't but in order to avoid

1278
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,879
There's ways to do that safely

1279
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
I just I disrespect this position

1280
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,839
Hey I know that he's afraid of Obamacare and all that

1281
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
I get I get why he wants to

1282
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
To spread his political for your butt

1283
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,751
The real-world impact of this

1284
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
Is really really ugly

1285
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,615
Specifically

1286
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
Because that be

1287
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
Denying you your choice

1288
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,783
Absolutely he's trying to protect his ideas by saying

1289
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,831
You can go kill yourself

1290
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,135
We just shouldn't allow it under the law

1291
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Bright like that doesn't make

1292
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Make sense

1293
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Is

1294
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
They want to steal

1295
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,567
Give you a kiss and then it's on the floor

1296
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
Then

1297
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:48,159
Defense Alex on this show role plays what it's like

1298
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
When a nurse

1299
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Is with a pregnant

1300
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,743
I want to hear this

1301
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
You feel safe at home

1302
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Money

1303
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Is fat

1304
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:34,495
Despacito

1305
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,383
Oh okay okay

1306
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:49,855
What is good luck for everyone

1307
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
You probably don't even need to pay your taxes

1308
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,607
If you don't be surprised because they're too busy doing it to everybody else

1309
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,935
You probably having experiences but everyone else

1310
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,495
Please Don't Talk Amongst yourselves

1311
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,799
About others never happens

1312
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,871
Ridiculous

1313
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
Oh you're having money troubles

1314
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Putting in the paperwork

1315
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,975
Steal the baby

1316
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Got a little

1317
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:33,631
She's got like a little bag teller secret alarm button underneath the

1318
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
This is crazy

1319
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
It is

1320
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
It is in line with it

1321
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
This song

1322
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,871
World's you that he has about family

1323
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
Like that

1324
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
So I can have anybody get

1325
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
There does need to be

1326
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
Implement of the state

1327
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
If kids are being a

1328
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Abuse

1329
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
It's stuff like that like you to need

1330
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Some sort of recourse

1331
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
I don't like

1332
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,399
Tweet we get a trend

1333
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,007
Positive

1334
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
He's really talk

1335
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
Here we are

1336
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
We are going into the control grin and with it comes a facekini cameras the secret police

1337
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,887
The public illegal aliens

1338
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,215
Clean-cut good-looking police

1339
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,495
People

1340
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Clean cuts

1341
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,615
Good-looking picture looking

1342
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:53,247
Families now they leave everyone who looks like they're foreigners alone

1343
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Right

1344
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
Could be anybody

1345
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,927
Certainly not clean-cut good-looking family

1346
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
She's not even a citizen

1347
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
About her

1348
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,959
I know that this is

1349
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Repetition

1350
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
To my madness too

1351
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
And just remind it do we need

1352
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Reminders

1353
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
Talks about positive

1354
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
It does seem to

1355
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
To be like

1356
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
He's talking about white

1357
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,783
And there's a differentiation

1358
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,319
People who are weird

1359
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Indifferent

1360
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,391
Clean-cut American

1361
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
Good family

1362
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Again

1363
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
This is the weakest link

1364
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
It's so obvious

1365
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Terrible

1366
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,655
You go to a place like well any

1367
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,519
I would like all the mainstream conservative Outlet they're just running towards his side

1368
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
The guy the guy who said you're out of your cotton-picking mind like

1369
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:54,175
You you are running

1370
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:58,527
They used to be better out of these stupid things

1371
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,855
This is where you're like I don't even know

1372
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
Something that I never predicted

1373
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
I don't even think

1374
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
This was the case at the Alexa

1375
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,279
I'm not I'm not 100% sure cuz I was not a

1376
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Scholar

1377
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Fox News

1378
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
Forsyth

1379
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,911
But I never would have predicted even in

1380
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
2000

1381
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,007
What we would end up with

1382
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
Is

1383
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
Fox News

1384
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
Coming like our

1385
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:26,431
Like I didn't think that what would happen is that we would experience

1386
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
But like

1387
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,991
That is what's happening

1388
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
Like a light

1389
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:35,135
Did the the overwhelming portion of right-wing media is now

1390
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
Blending towards

1391
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
Well they have to

1392
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
Well I mean

1393
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
In in

1394
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:49,727
They didn't they do kind of have to in order to door

1395
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,335
In order to continue existing as they are grounded

1396
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Run or something

1397
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
And they can't do that

1398
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
So

1399
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:03,807
You have to because the reality is he's doing everything that you said you

1400
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
That you said Obama was doing

1401
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,927
You have to make up reasons to book disbelief

1402
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,999
And the more reasons you make up to disbelieve thing

1403
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
The best way to disbelieve something is to

1404
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,839
Create something else to believe in

1405
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
IE the global

1406
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,679
Hugo

1407
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,239
Deep State on Fox News

1408
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
Those things in order to

1409
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
Cuz they're smart enough to know like

1410
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
About

1411
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,663
The connotations of using the specific

1412
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,967
SeaWorld

1413
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
How to deal with it

1414
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,183
Other than Alex

1415
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Yeah it's the same guy

1416
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
Gabby

1417
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
Show me the other day

1418
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
He was on Fox and Friends

1419
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,887
And he was talking about the

1420
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:56,543
And he was the one who said they're not argue.

1421
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,591
And there was a there was another

1422
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
Confront talking about

1423
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,223
How are

1424
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
America has not had

1425
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Purity

1426
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
Something like

1427
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Scandinavian countries

1428
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,487
They marry each other but we marry other breeds and races

1429
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Yeah

1430
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,583
Covert

1431
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,655
Nazi Network

1432
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,959
That work is that crazy

1433
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:30,079
Although at the same time I saw a regular Fox News

1434
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,895
Like like the news part

1435
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,991
Fox News is

1436
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:42,879
They're their opinion programming programming

1437
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,439
Represents itself exactly like their new show

1438
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
And I saw one of their regular Fox new shows

1439
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,935
Legos cute to see them try

1440
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
Is cute

1441
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,983
What's about to happen is

1442
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
On the 10th of February

1443
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,615
2009

1444
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
Gentleman by the name of Charles key

1445
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
You might remember him

1446
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
Cuz I brought him up earlier

1447
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,271
Guy from Oklahoma

1448
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Who

1449
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,111
Is putting forth that sovereignty belt

1450
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,303
Very funny

1451
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
McAllister

1452
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
He comes on his again

1453
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Charles Keith

1454
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
And we find out

1455
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
We find out the reason

1456
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,431
Did Alex Jones for the last cookies

1457
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
Now where the tap

1458
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
One of the reasons that

1459
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,503
He's pushing

1460
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
The states

1461
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,623
Asserting their sovereignty narrative

1462
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
Just Like Heaven

1463
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,719
This is exciting and there's a deeper reason

1464
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
Sunshine

1465
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,447
Oklahoma pass the resolution

1466
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:06,079
Boxer rescue

1467
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,919
We're not going to put up with those things you're not doing and can't

1468
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
Brave

1469
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,295
This is what you know what else

1470
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,855
We're going to stop at stop sign

1471
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,975
I don't know if that would have passes a house resolution would make

1472
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,583
Alex Jones

1473
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,679
Is that Oklahoma passed a resolution like this

1474
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,727
Retaliatory action

1475
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,335
In order to amend the Thunder

1476
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,871
Right now

1477
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
I

1478
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
Find this

1479
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,783
I do all right

1480
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
Give several examples why

1481
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,879
I will in a moment but before I do

1482
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
Here's my here's my stated

1483
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
About things like

1484
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,791
Oklahoma City is a really big

1485
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,119
We were going to get into it it would require

1486
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,447
A lot of research that I've done already

1487
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
And I don't give a

1488
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,359
Not because I don't care about the people who died or anything like that

1489
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
But because the burden of proof is on Alex

1490
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,479
If he wants to say

1491
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,551
Did Oklahoma City was that's too broad a claim

1492
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
I don't know what to do with that

1493
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,391
I need him to give me a specific

1494
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
I need him to point out one thing

1495
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,255
And then I'll look into that and we can go from there

1496
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,047
If he says this

1497
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,839
Did they pass this resolution

1498
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,655
Oklahoma City

1499
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,191
They put that.

1500
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
The teacher

1501
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
There's nothing I can do with

1502
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
There's no

1503
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
There's no amount of research

1504
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,104
Search that I can do

1505
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,640
Prove it

1506
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Tenuous connection

1507
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,968
Unfortunately

1508
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
In this interview Alex does bring up a

1509
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
Seabreeze up Tarrant

1510
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
Soccer broadcast

1511
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
Now

1512
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,208
He's a police officer in Oklahoma City

1513
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
Saved a bunch

1514
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,560
The bombing

1515
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Pulling out

1516
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
Between 4 and

1517
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
People from the wreck

1518
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Before falling

1519
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Through hole

1520
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Another building

1521
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,848
He fell two floors and injured his back

1522
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,384
And after that

1523
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,920
He became very

1524
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Despondent

1525
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
Felt an immense amount of guilt

1526
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Because

1527
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,344
And wasn't able to save more people

1528
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,136
Ended up committing suicide

1529
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Buddy you're after the Oklahoma

1530
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
Before he was supposed

1531
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
Receive

1532
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,328
A huge honor

1533
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,912
Before that

1534
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
Started to say things like I don't

1535
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
Don't deserve this

1536
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
And things like that

1537
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
Now imposter syndrome

1538
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,640
I've reviewed a lot of the evidence

1539
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,480
That conspiracy theorist was tortured and

1540
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
Killed

1541
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Reveal

1542
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,672
That it was also okay

1543
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Because

1544
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,000
He thought he was part of the whole conspiracy

1545
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,560
He believes

1546
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,120
Is that underpinning

1547
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
Names of the Oklahoma

1548
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Conspiracy

1549
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,704
Is the Terrance yeakey was

1550
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,008
A cop who was involved

1551
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
He was about to go public

1552
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824
And

1553
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
Deal with it

1554
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:27,200
I was making a bunch of statement

1555
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,736
In the heavy quote murdered

1556
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,784
Write the suicide was Ice

1557
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Actually a murder

1558
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,672
That's it looked over everything

1559
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
The Terrance yeakey

1560
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Murdered

1561
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
Looks like an all-too-common

1562
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
Distance of tragedy being

1563
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,584
Compounded

1564
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,400
The oak Oklahoma City Bombing with a complete

1565
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
Suicidal

1566
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
Who by all accounts

1567
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,520
Seems to be a good-hearted man

1568
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
Just another layer of that tragedy

1569
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,128
Circumstances of his death

1570
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,432
Particularly outside of what you might expect

1571
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,480
Suicide being done by someone who is not

1572
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
Suicide before

1573
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,296
Deer tattoos

1574
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
Superficial cuts to his wrist

1575
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
Throat

1576
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,136
But died from a gunshot wound

1577
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
This might seem strange

1578
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,976
But in reality

1579
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,256
Harder than you make

1580
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
To flash your wrist

1581
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
So

1582
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,144
The circumstances were Vicky

1583
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,424
It was in his car

1584
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,728
Have you tried to slash his wrists

1585
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
Conceivably his

1586
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
Yeah and then

1587
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
There's a bunch

1588
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
Blood

1589
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
The car

1590
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,920
His car was last

1591
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
You wandered about it

1592
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
The mile-and-a-half

1593
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,296
Your modern about a mile-and-a-half

1594
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,832
He was found

1595
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
In this field

1596
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Having shot himself

1597
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,440
So the issue is

1598
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,464
It takes an amazing

1599
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,024
That's the right word but

1600
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,328
That to cut yourself deeply enough to kill you

1601
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,632
I know this sounds really

1602
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
Indelicate

1603
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,192
And awful but it does

1604
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
I think we're

1605
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
You think

1606
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
This sucks

1607
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:03,712
This sucks to talk about

1608
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Was there

1609
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
I

1610
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
Did the whole thing

1611
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
Really hard to do

1612
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
I speak from experience myself

1613
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Yeah

1614
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,488
It's it's that you don't you don't

1615
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
AAA

1616
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,376
It's like a

1617
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
Really really close to trying to

1618
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,520
Cuz you're doing it with your own hands

1619
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,592
It's really close to trying to strangle yourself with your own hair

1620
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,616
Exactly

1621
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
It takes

1622
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
Take some

1623
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,504
You don't you don't

1624
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
Understand without having

1625
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:42,368
Gone

1626
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
You have to go

1627
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,464
Super deep and you have to really mean it

1628
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,048
I'm not saying you didn't mean it when he was trying to cut his wrist but like

1629
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,584
There are ways that you can kill you

1630
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Overdosing

1631
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,424
Or a gunshot that are more like a button

1632
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,472
Bright crafts

1633
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
Overdosing

1634
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,360
In that state you hope that it does

1635
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,408
Sprite and whiskey

1636
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
You done but Lake

1637
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,736
Cutting yourself is like

1638
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
You might

1639
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,784
Think it's deep enough but

1640
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,648
That might have been what he found himself

1641
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
I'm not

1642
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
Sure

1643
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
If you're walking a mile

1644
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,768
And then you shoot

1645
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
It wasn't there

1646
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,656
So now to reframe things a little bit cuz this is very important

1647
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,704
Believes

1648
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,544
He was attacked in the car

1649
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,080
And then drag

1650
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
A mile-and-a-half

1651
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
Batman killed

1652
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,016
Now the problem

1653
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,600
Never said is why the hell with the murderer is caught him up

1654
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,672
Barely cleanly but not enough to kill him

1655
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:51,744
Which likely would be impossible if you were fighting back

1656
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
Particularly considering that the cuts are on his wrist

1657
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
And his throat

1658
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,376
You know like you'd be fighting and then

1659
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,424
If you're trying to not kill him

1660
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,288
But then you get deep enough cuz he's fighting back it would there's no way to to

1661
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
Create vets

1662
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
Scenario

1663
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,896
Without going too far

1664
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
Nosey Parkton

1665
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Pittsfield

1666
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:18,368
Car which means that they would have had to been in

1667
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,648
Enclosed face with

1668
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
And further any of the cut

1669
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,256
He had would clearly cause blood stains on the murderer

1670
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,816
And more importantly do blood stains

1671
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
In the car

1672
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
Where the murderer would have been

1673
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,168
That's physical evidence of a person

1674
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,472
His car would be open and shut

1675
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
Doesn't exist

1676
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:35,776
Then

1677
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,336
You have to consider that these murderers would have to think

1678
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,688
It was a good idea to not kill him in the car where they've already done most of the work

1679
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:45,248
But instead of a mile-and-a-half

1680
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,040
To take approximately 30 minutes

1681
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,088
Under normal average walking condition

1682
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,880
But would probably be slow down

1683
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
By the barbed wire fences in the way

1684
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
And the very heavy

1685
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,512
Human who is he was 6 ft tall 3 in

1686
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,048
275

1687
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,608
The murderer would have to be dragging

1688
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,704
Yeah it was 66 357

1689
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Dragged him in there

1690
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:12,384
Conspiracy theory of mile-and-a-half after attacking him in the car he's bleeding but not

1691
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,920
Possibly still conscious

1692
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,480
A mile-and-a-half

1693
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
Very fair to assume that that would take 45 minutes

1694
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
50 minutes

1695
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,880
Generously

1696
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,928
To cover that

1697
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,256
The murderers would have had 240 reason

1698
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,584
Risk being out in the open with their victim

1699
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,680
For almost an hour when it any point he could scream or anyone

1700
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
Accidentally stumble on there

1701
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
That makes no sense from any perspective

1702
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,592
What is the job that needs to be done

1703
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,896
Could have been done right there in the

1704
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
The car

1705
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Then

1706
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
For no reason they would have to

1707
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,992
Choose an arbitrary

1708
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,528
Spot where I guess

1709
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
They walked far enough

1710
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
Where they decide to shoot

1711
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:57,440
Which they very much or even back at

1712
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,232
If car is a terrible plan

1713
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512
No one would have done it

1714
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:06,144
It's much easier to rationalize the idea that his wrists and throat

1715
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,912
And realized

1716
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,496
He couldn't do it you couldn't do it to the extent that would he wanted to end the

1717
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,520
His life

1718
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,544
But he couldn't do it that way

1719
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,872
Exact reason for leaving the car is anyone's guess I don't

1720
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,664
Pretend to have any idea what it would be

1721
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,224
But it could have been a fear that an errant shot

1722
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,040
If you was shooting himself could have blown up the car and caused

1723
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
Access damage

1724
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
The field he was in

1725
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Like a wildfire

1726
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,672
The idea that he would wander towards

1727
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
His childhood hometown

1728
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
El Reino which is

1729
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,512
Clothes to wear

1730
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,304
He ended up being his body was found

1731
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,120
Finish the suicide makes total sense

1732
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:41,472
I have no idea what the reality is but there could have been a Sentimental attachment

1733
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
Place where he ended

1734
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:47,104
Simple as that where he fell in ran out of enough strength

1735
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Text Carrie on

1736
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
The idea

1737
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,456
There was a downward

1738
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Trajectory

1739
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,272
To the bullet went through his head

1740
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,576
Okay

1741
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
People bring up as a Eva

1742
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,928
The murder is not

1743
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,256
There are a hundred different possible explanation

1744
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,792
For that one of the easier ones

1745
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,328
Is better to be the safest way to

1746
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,864
You shoot yourself if you're expecting

1747
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
A possible In-N-Out shot

1748
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,448
An upward trajectory could leave that bullet

1749
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,496
Nothing else

1750
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,032
Pecos popping out

1751
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
Beyond kind of

1752
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
Just feels natural if you put a

1753
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,688
Fake gun to your head like this and it kind of feels like

1754
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
There's a little bit of a downer

1755
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Projector

1756
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
Can see that even passed that a person's head could be

1757
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Loud when they're doing this

1758
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,880
To themselves and that would make it down to Rashad

1759
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
Also much more likely

1760
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
Settings Maurice

1761
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,488
So I started to look into his life

1762
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,120
That's just the details of the actual event

1763
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,680
Looking into that stuff was really

1764
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,216
Top because it's

1765
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,240
It's ugly

1766
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,288
Thinking about that stuff

1767
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Is never fun

1768
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:49,824
Gregory

1769
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,152
So I read an article in People magazine

1770
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
The 1990

1771
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Was called up for service

1772
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Persian Gulf

1773
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,904
They're his duties included the mass burial of civilian

1774
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,928
Has killed in the war

1775
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,464
Back

1776
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
You could tell there was a major

1777
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
Vicki he wasn't

1778
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Same

1779
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
There's an incredibly High likelihood that what was happening was

1780
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
Did he suffer from PTSD

1781
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
Miss PTSD was re triggered Isaac

1782
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
Experience in El Cajon

1783
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
City bombing

1784
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
Again from people

1785
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,640
On the night before his death sheriff's deputies found him sitting

1786
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
Disoriented in

1787
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Car by the roadside

1788
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:29,504
Vicky's house we're exhausted

1789
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,784
You spoke about the explosion

1790
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,088
Inviting that he was haunted by the images

1791
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Dead children

1792
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,160
Terrified of his own night

1793
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,720
Call I'm afraid of what I might do

1794
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
The former Canadian.

1795
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,840
More details about this specific

1796
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
The former Canadian

1797
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
Sheriff

1798
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
Clint Boling

1799
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,752
At the county that El Reino is

1800
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,824
He said okay

1801
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,128
Doesn't concur with the analysis

1802
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:03,296
Bowler said the Yankee showed up at his house in Delran on the afternoon of his death

1803
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,064
His car stop it

1804
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
Call in the middle of the road

1805
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,648
When his girlfriend Kate Allen

1806
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,928
The paramedic ran outside

1807
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,952
They found a police officer

1808
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
Virtually passed out

1809
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,024
Quote he couldn't tell us his name and

1810
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Lisa Tallon

1811
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
He was a real he was very anxious

1812
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,632
His heart rate was rapid he was sweaty

1813
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,424
He told us he'd been having constant

1814
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,704
Problems

1815
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,752
Slap get all the appearances

1816
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,776
My first guest

1817
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,568
Someone who is having emotion

1818
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
No problems

1819
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,872
And my second guess would be

1820
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Of course

1821
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
Some kind of substance

1822
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Abuse problem

1823
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,504
Basically they

1824
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Michigan is a quote

1825
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,552
From

1826
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Bowler

1827
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,136
Basically they are you talkin about parents

1828
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:39,904
Does family

1829
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,696
Ended up calling to pick him up

1830
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,720
And ideally take him

1831
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:46,304
Refuse to go to the hospital and family just let him leave

1832
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,352
Course they just let him go

1833
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Said bowler

1834
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,424
We told those people you needed help

1835
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,960
We knew he was suicidal

1836
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,984
He had all the classic

1837
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,080
It appears the parents suffered from a severe combination

1838
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,360
The PTSD from the Horrors

1839
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
Experience in the Gulf

1840
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,432
Mixed with survivor's guilt of not being able

1841
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,712
Save more people in Oklahoma

1842
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
Not to mention further PTSD

1843
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,296
Experiencing that terrorist

1844
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,064
Caswell

1845
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,624
The Murrah building deep and Yankees

1846
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,672
Distressed what other saw is

1847
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
Does heroism he regarded

1848
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
This failure

1849
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
He'd say

1850
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
How do I not fall in

1851
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
I could have saved more lives

1852
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,864
It's recalled his biological mother L Margera

1853
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,168
Terrence fell and hurt his back

1854
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,216
In his efforts to rescue people at the Murrah building

1855
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,008
Something that he was deeply ashamed

1856
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,080
And most likely led to him being prescribed opiates

1857
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
To deal with the pain

1858
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,176
It's unclear if that was the case but it's

1859
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,248
It is said repeatedly medication

1860
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,040
As a very common prescription

1861
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
Made in cases of

1862
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
Consistent app

1863
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,648
Caught you taking medication

1864
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,416
For his backs

1865
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
The Canadian County

1866
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
Sheriff

1867
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:48,000
Skid 45 medication

1868
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
Cinestar

1869
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Absolutely

1870
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
Murrah building

1871
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,888
Definitively say for date people that day

1872
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,008
His ex-wife

1873
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,568
Tony Rivera alleges that he was

1874
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,616
Or that he said that he wasn't there

1875
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,176
Which indicates her either not quoting him well

1876
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,248
Or testify stand being in a very bad emotional state when he said so

1877
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:10,528
Hello cuz line

1878
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:15,136
Additionally in a reflection of behaviors that are unfortunately,

1879
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,672
Returning Soldier struggling

1880
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,696
PTSD

1881
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,488
Appears to have had a history of making a violin

1882
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,328
Quote in a fit of temper Yankee had once threatened

1883
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
To take his life

1884
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,120
And those of his wife

1885
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,448
So he done

1886
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,728
And that sort of State

1887
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,800
That dude was fun

1888
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:35,616
It makes zero sense that quote today

1889
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,408
Would wait 13 months to kill the

1890
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
Person who allegedly seen evidence

1891
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
But the whole thing was a setup

1892
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,784
Many of the arguments that are made involving his

1893
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,600
Fall that happened rescue effort

1894
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,904
During a during the rescue efforts

1895
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,952
Have to do with the idea that he

1896
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,488
He fell through some floors in the

1897
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,280
Undetonated bomb

1898
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:58,400
Which is Ray Weaver

1899
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
Stuff up

1900
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,704
In the absence of any truth

1901
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Perpetually Bass

1902
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
Syndication

1903
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,032
People say that that

1904
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
Is what

1905
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,152
This is pure fiction used using some basic

1906
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,688
Details like the fall the tragic

1907
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,712
Suicide at cetera

1908
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,504
And forcing them to fit the predetermined

1909
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
Conclusion that these people want

1910
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,552
How to push forth

1911
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,112
Iey terrorism is never real

1912
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,416
It's always fall Flags done by the government

1913
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,440
Meant to demonize white people

1914
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Going to take away guns

1915
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,488
It's incredibly Des

1916
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
Yep The Story Goes

1917
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
How much more of this

1918
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Piper Reed

1919
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,632
Hellboy

1920
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,192
I am going to be honest I think we're good

1921
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,472
No because I need to

1922
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,008
Explain

1923
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
I need to explain to you that like

1924
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,128
The reason that people think that there is something

1925
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
Conspiratorial here

1926
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,992
Is not based on any real evidence

1927
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
It's Allstate

1928
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,808
His ex-wife

1929
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,600
Tanya Tony Rivera

1930
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
They all Trace back to

1931
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Like I've looked

1932
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Through the claims

1933
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,024
They have no backing

1934
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
There's notes

1935
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,072
Support to them

1936
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,096
Their nonsensical

1937
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
To ascertain

1938
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
This really quick

1939
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,216
One of the one of the stories

1940
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,008
Or the story that Alex would believe

1941
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,056
Is it Terrance yeakey was handcuffed

1942
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,080
Horribly beaten

1943
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
In his

1944
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,872
Experience

1945
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
At the end of his life

1946
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
The conspiracy sites

1947
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,248
Allege that he had someone else's blood on

1948
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,808
However this is not from any official report

1949
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,648
Well dr. Larry balding Oklahoma City

1950
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,440
Alexander quickly ruled the death a suicide

1951
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:29,536
Another medical examiner's report would according to Tony Rivera

1952
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,304
Surface

1953
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
Erie press

1954
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
Message from the grave

1955
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,376
This is something

1956
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,912
His ex-wife is a legend

1957
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,960
Mysterious second medical examiner

1958
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
Report

1959
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,288
Even necessarily exist based on any other

1960
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:45,408
I did get a hold of it and the report said that Terry balding

1961
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Great hair

1962
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,736
Lot of hair amazing amazing

1963
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,272
It's like a guy name

1964
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,040
Mini

1965
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:51,808
Smiles

1966
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
Benny's

1967
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
Medical examiner's report

1968
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
University

1969
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
Created

1970
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
Why would it also

1971
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,376
Just be alleged by this

1972
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,728
Where is that guy is was he commissioned

1973
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,800
Why would the government if they were trying to cover things up

1974
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,896
It's better hire another guy to get the real

1975
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,992
The other further Evidence about this goes like this

1976
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,064
Function review

1977
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,392
Sister had a chance encounter with a mortician who worked on Yankees body

1978
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,672
She was discussing

1979
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
Astringent

1980
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,000
The death of someone at the party

1981
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
Not knowing the woman was Rivera's sister spoke up

1982
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,840
Quote that sounds like

1983
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
Just like Apple

1984
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,400
Police officer we worked on it Oklahoma City

1985
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,448
But you said when asked if the

1986
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,984
Deterrence Yankee the mortician

1987
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Freak

1988
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:46,592
Murderers and those covering up his death had not counted on the

1989
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
This particular morticians test

1990
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,224
That is not a credible story anyway

1991
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,744
This story that's being told is completely unnamed alleged mortician that Rivera is claiming that

1992
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,304
Unspecified social

1993
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:12,192
Horrible

1994
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:17,312
Really remember drunk

1995
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
The story of without further back

1996
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,896
Mortician

1997
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,688
Statement that he made him come

1998
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,248
Means nothing it's just another

1999
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
Piece of dubious

2000
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Information coming from this Rivera

2001
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,600
Now here's a

2002
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
What's Miss Rivera's

2003
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,928
Axe to grind

2004
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
She has a vested

2005
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:35,744
Have not had a

2006
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
Committed suicide

2007
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
Insurance

2008
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,608
And there we go

2009
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,424
I'm not saying that's a hundred percent

2010
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
The reason that

2011
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:47,008
She would do this I understand also grief

2012
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,800
I also understand

2013
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:55,456
Kind of like to make stuff there's no such a thing

2014
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
There's those sorts of aspect

2015
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,600
Time there was

2016
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,696
Allowed if it wasn't a suicide

2017
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,744
And it she has a very strong

2018
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,512
Financial interest

2019
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Bob maker

2020
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,144
I just have to be clear cuz I know nothing about her

2021
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,424
Except for that restate

2022
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,960
She's made that most of the

2023
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,984
Conspiracies about this

2024
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:24,384
This guy revolve around don't make sense nothing behind

2025
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
You can't find it

2026
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:29,760
Just when you look at them

2027
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,112
Document it that

2028
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,392
And that doesn't

2029
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Exist and

2030
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,184
Timesheet

2031
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
So I don't know

2032
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,144
So this is been my very long way of saying

2033
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Alex finally brought up a

2034
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,984
Pacific about Oklahoma City

2035
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,776
And I don't buy it

2036
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
I'll buy it one bit

2037
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
You got them

2038
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,456
Somebody knocking at the door

2039
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
I don't do a bus to stop there too gross cuz I do feel so bad for the guy

2040
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,672
I totally

2041
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,560
Like that's that's a brutal situation

2042
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:21,216
If you never had a chance to any did something

2043
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:27,104
Along with v like

2044
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,896
Threatening to kill his kids

2045
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,200
Nope

2046
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,504
No there's no there's no there's no way we

2047
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,808
Tyrell

2048
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Positive figure but

2049
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,880
The idea of turning him in

2050
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,416
To someone who was going

2051
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
2

2052
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,488
Unleashed this information

2053
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:47,840
Again 13 months after

2054
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,376
We could have done any of this

2055
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:56,800
Told people definitively what he was going to reveal or have any of his things on a dead drop

2056
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,592
It's just Alex Jones trying to call

2057
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,408
Created

2058
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,456
Charles Keith

2059
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,992
Trying to create

2060
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:05,760
A character

2061
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,808
Story much the same way out

2062
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
Been trying to do

2063
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,624
Was Anthony Bourdain

2064
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,440
Write the same sort of behavior

2065
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
And it's pink

2066
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
Credibly just

2067
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,024
Also Charles key

2068
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,792
Charles Kelley

Chucky

2071
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,888
He also

2072
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,912
1

2073
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,984
I believe the election right before this to the Oklahoma

2074
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,824
State Legislature

2075
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,896
F****** 531 on a technicality

2076
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,712
Greener pastures

2077
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:41,344
2018 where everyone is screaming at members of the Trump campaign

2078
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,392
Not allowing them to

2079
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,440
It's delightful it's wonderful

2080
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,976
Alex is not into it

2081
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:53,376
Now what is he saying about this sort of behavior 9 years ago

2082
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:07,456
Yep

2083
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:16,672
Interruption

2084
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:28,448
Church

2085
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,776
Talks

2086
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:38,176
I mean Stephen Miller should have two black eyes so big it's tough to get around like

2087
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:47,648
So high agree I agree I agree

2088
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:56,608
Because I feel like I didn't

2089
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
My point perfect

2090
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:01,216
Clear was that Carmelo had a terrible season 2

2091
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
10A should not have been

2092
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,056
Is over they called it the big three

2093
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,408
About that

2094
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,224
Because it's an umbrella

2095
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,504
The

2096
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
The Narrative that he's pushing

2097
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,088
About the states

2098
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,648
Is very clearly and service

2099
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,720
Those beliefs that he has but Oklahoma City

2100
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
He's

2101
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,048
Using this narrative in order to Hope

2102
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,352
That something happens in one of those

2103
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:35,008
And then he could be like it's just like Oklahoma City over again okay I just had to make that clear cuz I'm

2104
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:41,408
Okay so what you're saying is immediately is like his point is immediately after Oklahoma original

2105
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,688
Did the saying right

2106
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,968
Then the bombing happen

2107
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:50,368
To teach him a lesson

2108
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:56,768
If something happens in any one of these damn I got another okay so I can make

2109
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:00,096
Very clearly obvious

2110
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:00,864
He's doing

2111
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,704
Once you get a smell of him

2112
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,032
You kind of get used to it it's so clear what he's doing

2113
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,104
Please let someone bomb Oklahoma again

2114
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,408
Arizona

2115
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,432

2120
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
That I generally hate Alex Jones

2121
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:37,472
Listcrawlers

Old weird anti-communist John Birch Society

2146
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:30,624

01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:48,800
Not fair I bet this guy is totally totally into women voting

2150
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
Such a contradiction

2151
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:55,968
Totally I love it

2152
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,040
He's just got one Progressive streaking

2153
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:05,696

Something to build on caller I don't like this next caller much

Her Disturbed too much and

2172
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:55,616
I thought it kicked our imagination until II

2173
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,432
Look at

2174
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:02,784
Original copies of your DVDs

2175
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:07,392
And every last one of them it looks like somebody took sandpaper

2176
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,952
Went from one side to the other on

2177
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,536
I'll tell you what's going on

2178
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:16,608
Okay

2179
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:22,240
Also

2180
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,040
You need to describe

2181
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,320
Fold-out

2182
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392

He has

2185
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
Maybe he's at a local bar

2186
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,704
Now that we've got a Fed in house

2187
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,520
So many possibilities

2188
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:59,616
Caribou this is the game that you played

2189
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,664
You try and push pay

2190
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,432
Patriots

2191
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,504

01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,576
Do you have any pets

2193
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,624

Are you keeping those DVDs

2195
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:18,816
Is it possible that you kept them in like an unsafe place anyway

2196

Not most of my furniture is Cactus based

2202
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:56,704
There's a hundred explanations I can come up with for Howard other than breaks in

2203
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,264
My blankets are woven from my own

2204
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544

Planet articles I don't drive

2219
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,864
Now I have no idea is probably more to the story but I have

2220
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,944
But yes they probably went in your house looking for something

2221
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,696
There are no real terrorists but

2222
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,744
Last year

2223
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:08,288
They said this is wrong but we have to show

2224
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:14,432
Don't like videos

2225
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:17,760

400

2229
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:35,424
That's a good answer

2230
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:44,640
I don't know man I don't feel like it's good to reinforce people paranoia like that feel like that's a very unhealthy

2231
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:48,224
Bi did absolutely trap

2232
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,808
People into

2233
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
Terrorism

2234
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,136
But

2235
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
Wasn't

2236
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,952
Wasn't black bag and white people

2237
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,232
I'll tell you that right now

2238
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:02,048
I don't know if you know anything about the FBI

2239
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
Long history

2240
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:07,680
Terrible things

2241
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
Waste their time breaking it

2242
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
Someone tries to scratch out

2243
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:17,408
Abilene absolutely another copy

2244
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,432

We've wasted 2 hours of this old dudes for the feds

2250
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,840
I don't understand I don't understand any of this

2251
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:40,960
There's such a benign explanation that his dog just so I can scratch them or something like

2252
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,264
Who's 100 different explanations

2253
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
I like the difference it's so disgraceful

2254
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:55,808
Need to do is become even more radicalized to my team

2255
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
Are numbers

2256
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,880
Much better than they are now but

2257
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,184
Well

2258
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,536
Think of anything that's on YouTube

2259
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,072
Weird phone call

2260
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,472
Ex-wife 31 Moore clips

2261
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,496
Alex wants to

2262
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:17,056
The make you scared about how the military doesn't exist

2263
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:34,976
Brainwashing

2264
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,008
But job

2265
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:52,384
920

2266
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:58,784
Cool cool

2267
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:05,696
It is

2268
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:09,024
2009 style is that like it's not

2269
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:14,400
He will give you whiplash of the present-day but it'll be like

2270
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:17,984
Yeah, you caught me off-guard you got me unawares

2271
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,520
But I like the

2272
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,896
Security by 2009

2273
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,344
Real tight

2274
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,880
Yeah pretty good

2275
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,696
The primordial ooze

2276
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,720
From which

2277
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,536
The modern-day at Hibbett's will eventually come

2278
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
Absurd

2279
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,840
Jordan over this

2280
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Discourse

2281
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:49,472
I think is the most important is that one of Alex Jones is pillars

2282
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,520
It is Oklahoma City narrative is b*******

2283
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,568
Right now

2284
01:54:54,080 --> 01:55:00,224
Find out what kind of

2285
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,528
States are declaring their sovereignty

2286
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,344
Is very relevant to Modern Day stuff

2287
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,392
Sovereignty is what he has a boner for now

2288
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:13,536
It's very relevant that he's only really using that as I as the interstitial way to set

2289
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
The table

2290
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,840
To make propaganda

2291
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,632
An attack happens

2292
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,424
It's clear because he's not it

2293
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:22,240
Dealing with the fact that

2294
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,776
All of this resolution

2295
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:28,384
All of us house resolutions that are put in biology States

2296
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:33,504
They are a coordinated group of quote-unquote

2297
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,856
He's not he's trying to present it is

2298
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,672
Burgeoning up in August

2299
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,464
And that's not the case at all

2300
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,512
And he's also not dealing with the fact that

2301
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,048
In the same way that he doesn't

2302
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,328
Address that

2303
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,912
Those FEMA camp bills that he's makes people so scared of

2304
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,192
Are real

2305
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,984
And they'd never made it out of committee

2306
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,032
Most of these don't make it out of

2307
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,384
Make a resolution of the Law's the law

2308
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,688
We're not scared that a black guy's the president

2309
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,736
And that's really what's driving

2310
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
The other half

2311
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
And if

2312
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,576
How many terrible

2313
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
This is just

2314
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
Terrible

2315
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Yeah

2316
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:16,256
We should wrap this up

2317
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:19,072
Ironic it is a never-ending source of irony

2318
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,352
That

2319
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,400
Immediately after Obama got elect

2320
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,704
The conservative media

2321
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,288
Went hard into him turning into a tyrant

2322
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,080
Putting people in Camp

2323
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,360
Doing all of this s***

2324
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
And then at their

2325
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:35,712
Alexa guy

2326
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:39,552
Who does all the s*** that they thought of Obama was going to

2327
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,856
I'm really glad you brought that up because that's

2328
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:42,880
Good

2329
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
Cliffhanger

2330
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,696
Faraar episode that will come out

2331
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:49,536
Tomorrow

2332
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:51,584
As an emerging

2333
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:54,656
Call know are we going back to the present day

2334
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,704

Help in terms of growing the audience

01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,096
Any help in terms of our audience

2342
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:28,960
No absolutely not

2343
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:36,384
We kind of don't want more of you but on the other side of that we need a whole lot more

2344
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:42,784
We don't want more people good-hearted.

2345
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,112
And so unlike most

2346
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:47,904

01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,608
Tell people you know we're cool right

2352
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:59,168
Let them hear about the show we want a game

2353
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,216
One listener added

2354
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:07,872
Pretend like we are people selling drugs

2355
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,432
The terrible plan

2356
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,736
Alright so we're going to get out of here it's my turn

2357

01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
Been saying
