00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
11 a.m.

189
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
A Peter W call Joseph Watson comes in

190
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Record store

191
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Concerns this is silly

192
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Restrictions with supposedly

193
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
75

194
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
529

195
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
90% of

196
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
The people I would say is still wearing masks inside shops

197
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Isaura family

198
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
The year in the UK

199
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Eating lunch in between putting

200
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Taking off

201
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Tons of people wearing masks

202
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Outside

203
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Week of the year

204
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,431
Being terrified I being brainwashed

205
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
I don't

206
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
People wearing masks

207
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
Now that now that it's not the

208
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Purity of

209
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
Brighten underwear mask

210
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
And they're choosing to on their own

211
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
I'm so mad about that must be terrified into brainwash

212
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Miss

213
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
They are aware of risk

214
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Spinner bacon calculated decision

215
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
The air on the side of caution

216
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah I guess this angers ball

217
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
So silly

218
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Yeah I mean if this was

219
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Pre-pandemic

220
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
And people just started choosing to wear masks

221
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
For any number of reasons like including just

222
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
Having a mass culture similar to some Asian countries you know

223
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Like

224
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,047
Then we wouldn't be a problem there wouldn't be this whole f******

225
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
How dare the government like we had a pandemic and people are like I don't want to give people the flu anymore either like just

226
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,055
You could see very easily a reality where Alex

227
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
Decided to go hard on like Chemtrails stuff

228
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,503
I was like you need to wear my underwear men block out the other than whatever it is falling from the sky

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
And you know that info Warriors my wear masks in public or something

230
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Think I would

231
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Considerate like

232
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
A crisis no

233
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Maybe that's dumb

234
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Whatever

235
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
I just

236
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
Is it has to take something out of here to be able to

237
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Complain about that

238
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,591
I went on a walk yesterday and 75% of people wearing masks

239
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
And instead of going

240
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Yep

241
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
This gets one of those standard Infowars and Paul Joseph Watson responses mermaid which is

242
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Care

243
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,463
Drift into territory that's a little bit more into

244
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
We know they were brainwashed

245
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
We've got a document

246
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
This was the decision that was made of this.

247
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Deviation

248
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
From the normal response to a

249
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Every single historical

250
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
And instead they travel

251
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
By making them

252
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
More afraid

253
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Of the threat the actual threat

254
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
That's just simply not

255
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
True

256
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,535
Princeton Cesspool think that the approach to Ebola outbreaks historically has been to strive for herd immunity

257
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
He was working at Infowars on the last big one happened so I'm sure he knows how that went. Don't you remember when that

258
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
Happened everybody was like okay lineup

259
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
We need to meet all of these people everybody needs to

260
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
Kiss all of the same time to World's Fair Michael Adams cure

261
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
It was also working at Infowars during the 2003 SARS outbreak and you must know that the goal in that case wasn't

262
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Herd immunity

263
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Toronto imposed

264
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Strict lockdown

265
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
Community spread and other measures

266
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Perused

267
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
In other places

268
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,471
For my article on the containment measures being employed from the May 2003 issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal

269
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Quote

270
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Initial efforts to stop the spread of the disease consisted of

271
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Hospital isolation of infected

272
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
Involuntary home quarantine of close contact contact

273
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
Home quarantine was soon expanded to include

274
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Potentially exposed

275
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
Various jurisdictions including Ontario Hong Kong Singapore

276
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
In the United States

277
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Have now invoke statutory powers

278
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Permit involuntary Courant

279
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
In the case of SARS containment measures were fairly effective

280
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
Partially due to the different nature of how it was transmitted

281
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Compared to the current outbreak

282
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
To be transmitted by people who had the virus but we're asymptomatic which made it much easier for people to self Courant

283
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
If you have symptoms you can very easily not go around people

284
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,855
And the work of isolating becomes a lot more sensible you know if your rational brain gets

285
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Save MB

286
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
If you may have been exposed to the virus a week ago

287
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,071
You have no idea that it happened you haven't developed symptoms yet but you could be

288
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Be contagious

289
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Things are pretty difficult to manage

290
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
And so

291
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
The argument of acting as if

292
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,519
The worst case scenario is there is

293
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Something that is

294
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
How do you understand we were there and that was not the case with

295
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
Organic difference between other pandemics

296
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
To the past and even so

297
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,207
In attempts to protect Public Health various efforts similar to the ones we're seeing that were used

298
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,863
If you go back and you look at some of the articles that were being published in 2003 you'll see the fair where the beginnings of attempts to make

299
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
Vaccines that would focus on the spike proteins of SARS

300
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
Absolutely would have been pursued more aggressively of containment measures had failed as they did in our present reality

301
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Like you see the track

302
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
Already like there

303
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
This is exactly what would have happened

304
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
If things had gone South

305
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
2000

306
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Yeah it is this argument

307
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,183
That argument of appealing to this is it's not how we used to do things his self

308
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
That's

309
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
That somebody

310
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
F****** 200 years ago been like

311
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,423
Why are we trying to contain this this is God's plan and if you get sick you get sick

312
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,495
That's how it's always been that's how it always will be

313
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
It's a test yeah it's the same

314
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
The same s*** like no we should do it the way we used to do it no

315
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Better than that

316
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,855
So when we go to the pastor when we look around we often see Alex being wrong about things

317
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,695
Most recently of course Bill Clinton being the Secretary General of the UN

318
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
1006

319
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,071
That was a strange couple years 2000 wrong wrong predict

320
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Japon Alex

321
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Well one of things you see in the present

322
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
It's really fun it's Alex

323
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Constantly talking about how

324
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Vindicated

325
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Everything you said has been right

326
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Things he loves

327
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
To do is whenever you someone like Paul around

328
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
You get the real sanctimonious

329
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,271
Let me ask you how does it feel to always be right

330
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
This is one of my favorite things I love this shitt

331
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Evolve

332
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
For 22 years

333
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Makers.com

334
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Keep it active since you were Niceville

335
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
I should stipulate

336
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
The blog is not being in the media we have a fairly decent audience for

337
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,991
I'm not positive that Paul has ever been

338
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
27

339
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
You're the longest

340
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
First but I've worked with on this

341
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
What is it like to be totally

342
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Tennessee from

343
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Research

344
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
What they were planning

345
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
And know that we're in their endgame

346
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Accelerate it all

347
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Autopia is

348
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
What is it like to be vintage

349
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
I mean it's kind of surreal because you

350
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
You don't want to believe in yourself

351
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
I've got great news

352
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
Wow just a nice little hand job of self-congratulatory b******* right there

353
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,743
I think it's really fun Tuesday like I was listening to this

354
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
I don't often listen to Paul Joseph Watson eat I don't

355
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Think about him too much

356
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
But I was like wow

357
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
This guy's a worm

358
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,383
Deposition where he's talking about how like I do I told Alex.

359
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
Talk about Sandy Hook

360
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
Associate with a guy who get paid pretty well I guess

361
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:10,719
Paid really well it's outrageously really well

362
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
But I think that

363
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
That kind of editorial difference would be career and career-ending but like who would end your time

364
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Yeah you would hope you'd think

365
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,799
Yeah and if you understood the ramifications of the decision

366
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
That you were opposed to your

367
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
Eating other people's lives in the victims families

368
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
The damage that was done because

369
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,391
Somebody decided to do the thing that you warned them was on escalator all

370
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
The other hand

371
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
In good conscience stay employed there

372
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
On the other hand

373
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Most people

374
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
On in the states

375
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,959
It's work for someone who has committed crimes against humanity

376
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,775
Maybe not directly but the CEO

377
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,151
You know like everybody's everybody's working for evil now I I wouldn't be best friends with it

378
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,295
Or the direct subordinate I think you're talking about a different thing

379
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,599
I think really more

380
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Realistically I think

381
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Paul knows that

382
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
He's not employable

383
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
The rebel

384
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Maybe you could get a gig at The Rim

385
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,191
Dance with the one what brung you a kind of situation

386
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
So

387
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
Paul's got another little boy to make it actually offended

388
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Kay military is only supposed

389
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Adversaries

390
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
And yet we have something

391
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
The 77th

392
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
What day did Alex at the start

393
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Chinese government

394
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Typing

395
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
The Hysteria

396
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
You remember those videos all the Chinese

397
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Convulsing

398
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Even though

399
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Military

400
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
I would gchq

401
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
Social media

402
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
And through the combine

403
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
If the 77th Brigade which was

404
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:17,440
Responsible for disseminating propaganda that overhyped the virus and work to amplify the videos that alleged to show people falling over in the

405
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
If that was what they were actually doing

406
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,608
They could have had no better Ally in that effort than Alex Jones in the early part of 2000

407
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
100-percent easy to forget now because he's been doing this denial is s*** for quite a while but previously

408
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
Use banging The Different Drum

409
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,896
He was hyping the virus up in order to sell survival food and dump it

410
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
It's over

411
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
4

412
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Humanity

413
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,808
He played all those videos that went around on social media people collapsing

414
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,648
He played unverified videos of streets in China being cleaned with trucks

415
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Big hoses

416
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,024
He played the videos of people in Wuhan yelling encouragement to each other from their windows

417
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
Reporting it as been screaming in horror

418
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
You can hear Alex's giddy excitement

419
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,472
To get his hands on such a video as soon as Mike Adams brings it up

420
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
In this clip from February 24th

421
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,872
I saw a haunting video last night

422
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Find us easily was in

423
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Chinese

424
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
And it was just a

425
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Video

426
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Film in Ohan

427
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Of all the

428
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Buildings at night

429
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
In the background

430
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
The Scream

431
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
The Haunting blood-curdling screams from

432
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
People that mental

433
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
I want to see in their mind

434
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
I will yeah we've got the link

435
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Is very excited

436
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
And not only did Alex do all of that

437
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,984
He also made up a ton of s*** to scare his audience at the thing that things were worse than they were in China

438
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,616
One of the Prime examples of that was how incendiary Alex that were being released

439
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
The number of people infected in China

440
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,992
Was secretly actually the number of people dead from the virus

441
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
He was telling the audience that it was his belief

442
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
That the number of reported that in China was being

443
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Drastically underreported

444
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
I thought it was total chaos

445
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
This is a clip from his February 6th

446
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
We got to get ahead of this if you notice

447
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
Thousand confirmed we're locked in here a few minutes go 24,000

448
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
The internal Chinese numbers that leaked

449
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
Rapid publish in China by the people daily

450
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
24000 dead

451
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Yesterday

452
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
They're doing is they're just

453
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
The number of dead is a number.

454
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,584
Alex engaged in all of the worst Scare Tactics he's accusing the mainstream media of engaging in

455
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,400
You just counting on his audience not remembering a-rollin

456
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Accountable because they never do

457
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,312
What are the big things that Paul and Alex are up in arms about is how no young people were killed by the virus

458
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,688
Here's a clip from this week's interview from the 20th of July

459
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Of Paul and Alex complaining about the

460
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
Melow twelve-year-olds be shot

461
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
There is no danger of K

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
All the side effects is that not.

463
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
But we have the numbers

464
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
25

465
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
People

466
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
19

467
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
From covid in the UK

468
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
Across a year. Two-thirds of those have serious illnesses so it's literally

469
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
In the UK

470
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,016
That's a fun presentation when you're trying to run an anti-vaxxer narrative grip but

471
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
What times are different like

472
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
Back on February 24th and you're trying to run

473
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,000
Different crib for you scare your audience into buying survival food and toothpaste or heavily implying can protect them from a deadly virus

474
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
You might have a slightly different angle

475
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
The number for coming out we know that

476
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
Killing healthy young people

477
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
What is killing a high number of those

478
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
They are in fact

479
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
These people are f****** creeps

480
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
And I want to make one thing super

481
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Clear

482
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
This Gambit Alex and Infowars is running now is being funded by the money that they scammed off people with the extreme fear-mongering

483
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
The paranoia about covid

484
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
Which now they're pretending they never engaged in

485
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
And that's important

486
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
And something the people should not forget

487
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
I was digging around in the archives for a couple of these clips though and remembering a lot of the specific

488
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
It made me mad

489
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
I don't like

490
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
Mad mad little mad I understand I didn't want to leave this little segment here that we're doing on that note

491
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,848
So I thought it might be fun to remind you of one of my favorite things

492
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
They came out of Alex's early covid bulshit

493
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
This is the best

494
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Like my brother told me I don't know where you got this

495
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Bubble wrap because of all the air

496
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Comes from China

497
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
Great point and more

498
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
Points f****** people are idiots comes from

499
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
China

500
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Grateful

501
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Great Point bubble wrap

502
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,056
Anyway I find I find this disgusting

503
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
Disposition

504
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
IMDb The Wiggles at Paul and Alex are trying to do

505
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
And Paul is he ever going to have to do a deposition or he tells people

506
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,672
You told Alex not to say all that s*** about the virus early 2020

507
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,536
We're going to have to pretend that 20 I was on the right side of that one too

508
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,840
Something needs to happen about that

509
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
It's f***** up

510
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
You know like I keep going back to the reports

511
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
F******

512
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
Jared goddamn Kushner is 6 months into it and

513
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
They're they're like

514
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
He had the chance to implement

515
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
The cdc's plan but they told him that to Maywood

516
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Mainly going to be in the cities

517
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,296
And the cities are mainly Democratic so we let the s*** go

518
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
Like that is a situation where I don't know how we're not

519
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Investigating that like all the

520
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Cuz that's

521
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
F****** even even under ideal circumstances it feels like something

522
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,144
Take a long time to fully unravel investigation

523
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
To terms with

524
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
All of the errors that were made

525
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,544
Intentional or unintentional along the way

526
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
But Alex is errors

527
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Very intention

528
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,432
Very intelligent

529
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
The archive of Clear Lake

530
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,344
Why it's a little more overt than I remembered that this was about selling food and pills

531
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Yeah gross

532
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:11,488
Yeah I remember I remember that and I also remember

533
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
A good project

534
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Camelot where

535
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
She claimed it

536
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
They were bored

537
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Writing people up because they were vampires

538
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Where's that one was my favorite possibly

539
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,728
That one was my favorite

540
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,056
That was a good one

541
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
David Johnson

542
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
And he's a quote-unquote whistleblower

543
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,600
Sure who's working with project veritas

544
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
He's a guy who

545
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,952
He eats pose that they were teaching

546
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
Critical race Theory at Hasbro

547
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
Sounds like a Mad Lib

548
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Honestly

549
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
30 Chick-fil-A

550
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Boy

551
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,544
Humanity

552
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
I was bewildered by this

553
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,408
So he decided to leave

554
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
After this Sinister critical race Theory thing

555
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,368
Whistle blew and now he has a GoFundMe thing with his $130,000 raise

556
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,976
Oh wow what a good scam

557
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Pretty good

558
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,352
I think I could do Tsum that's at least a year's salary at wherever he was work

559
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
No at least

560
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,288
I guarantee I guarantee that I couldn't anyway

561
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Quit the show

562
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Call up

563
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
James O'Keefe

564
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
Do you think hard

565
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
You can make up any

566
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Nobody would care be brutal

567
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,952
So this guy is on and I honestly don't think

568
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,328
Great care to take what he saying all that seriously and one of the reasons is this

569
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Bonita

570
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
People based on

571
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
Their character by the actions that they

572
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Sawgrass in the truest sense

573
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Martin Luther King

574
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
One of my favorite quotes from

575
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Generation

576
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
The circumstances of your birth are irrelevant

577
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
What you do with life

578
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
From

579
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
That's an interesting quote

580
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,448
Got a strange you didn't say what movie it's from the car makes me suspect that he's trolling

581
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
That's on the Pokemon movie

582
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
I don't know how old this dude is butt

583
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Strong's

584
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,408
Suspicion that he's too young for the Pokemon movie to have been one of the most

585
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
The biggest movies of

586
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Childhood

587
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
However online you can find a fair amount of memes using the

588
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Misquote

589
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
I'm not positive but I suspect that

590
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
It's kind of part of a joke that grew out of the whole incident that the the GOP primaries where Herman Cain quoted the theme song

591
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
A Pokemon to a quote famous poet

592
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
Yes yeah I think I think that there's some of that

593
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
In meme culture that is

594
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
You know you can fly in

595
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
A bunch of

596
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Inspirational

597
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Posts

598
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
It is like Mewtwo also find some that are trying to attributed

599
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,016
Two other people

600
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,368
I remember I remember Thomas Jefferson in one of his letters

601
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Route something

602
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Just truly beautiful and it was just like

603
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
I want to be the very best

604
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
I like no one ever was

605
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:34,496
Write the Declaration this must remember the first time I read Federalist number 5

606
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
Gotta catch em all

607
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't I don't know

608
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,832
He delivered that quote in the way that he's being kind of cagey about not

609
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:55,232
Quote saying what movie is not take this dude all this year I think he might be f****** with Alex

610
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
I don't really know and I don't want to over

611
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
So anyway Alex's big news

612
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
This is still like

613
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
The David Johnson interview still going on

614
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
But he has he has to let you know something okay

615
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Big ass news

616
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Bombshell

617
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Because I

618
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Documents

619
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
To show you this properly

620
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll tell you about that either

621
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Weather today

622
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Special broadcast

623
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
I am at the hold on mr. Johnson let me break in here

624
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
I have breaking news

625
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
That I will tell you tomorrow

626
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Breaking story up,

627
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Breaking news

628
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
News eventually will break

629
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
I love it

630
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
This is not uncommon Behavior at all

631
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
So unfortunately Alex

632
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
Kind of tips his hand

633
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Breaks the news

634
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
Last night with us

635
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
What's in this lawsuit

636
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
45

637
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
The first few days from vaccine

638
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
I've also got two more boxes

639
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
I don't I don't know what he's talkin to

640
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
What Lotto

641
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
I don't know he's in a workout

642
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
20th and 21st

643
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
Right and I don't know

644
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
You don't know

645
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
Dimensions that some people are

646
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Suing

647
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,536
Somebody it's unclear I think he says that they're going to be on the show on Friday

648
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
But yes

649
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,192
Big bombshell that Alex won't cover is that 43,000 people have died from the vaccine

650
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
He has evidence of it and he doesn't

651
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
I guess on Mondays show if those people are on Fridays

652
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Episode of History I guess we'll

653
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
Be able to learn what it is but we're covering the 20th and 21st and 20th

654
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,856
Houses that on the 21st he will be breaking this news

655
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
He breaks that news on the 20th

656
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,768
And then on the 21st he will not break the news any further other than to say that on the 23rd

657
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
On the 22nd 23rd he'll talk to the people

658
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
That are involved in this news

659
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
Alright

660
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
I need a calendar

661
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,336
So he talks to David a little bit and

662
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
This is

663
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
This is just one

664
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Corporate I was like okay

665
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
I think I get a sense of what's going on here

666
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,528
When did they start when did you first then

667
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
That you were supposed to go through this

668
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
I'm very shortly into my time

669
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,232
I just saw the meeting for critical race theory on Mike

670
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
That was really the first time it came up

671
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
I've been aware that has Roy has kind of done

672
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Similar things based

673
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,496
Critical race Theory before like I think they have

674
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
Monopoly before which

675
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Kind of pushes the

676
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Gender Theory

677
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
I gotta think that this

678
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Guys f****** around

679
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
That does not seem like a serious

680
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,792
But then also was working at Hasbro for a short. Of time probably didn't like it

681
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Hated it hashed out

682
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Yelp

683
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Yelp

684
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
It's such a good scam

685
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Oh man

686
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
I really like you

687
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
You know

688
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,848
You don't think about the scam until you've already seen it done too many times

689
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Ansia no

690
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,480
Like at my old job I could have pulled this game it wouldn't have been hard

691
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,320
You just walk out the door and make bulshit up

692
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Brutal

693
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
So Alex

694
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,696
Talks to this dude and I a scientist

695
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Interview on

696
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
Convincing on capella

697
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,352
Another interview with Angela Stanton

698
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
King

699
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Okay

700
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
She's person who ran

701
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
For office

702
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
In Georgia

703
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Chi

704
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
She's already made clear that she's not related to Martin Luther King

705
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
She's the goddaughter of

706
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Alveda King

707
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Who is the niece

708
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Of Martin Luther King

709
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
So we're not

710
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Connected

711
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,976
At least you know personally connected

712
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,560
They can do a barbecue together Alex

713
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,888
This is this is weird praising on his part

714
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
What would

715
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Martin Luther King jr.

716
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
I think that he would agree at all

717
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Manisses

718
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,576
If he hadn't been assassinated Martin Luther King Junior be 92 years old right now

719
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,928
Here is a few people who are currently alive at 92 years old

720
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
Noam Chomsky Berry Gordy

721
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
Barbara Walters and Bob Newhart

722
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,096
I understand that he was killed in what feels like the far

723
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Past but

724
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Not that long ago

725
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Blue f*****-up

726
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
To call Martin Luther King someone's ancestor

727
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Yeah

728
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Yes

729
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
Yeah

730
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:04,480
F***** up really happened fast it really happen fast they turned a hero who died

731
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,856
Recently into Santa Claus so quick and they refuse to acknowledge all of the other s*** that he was

732
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Clockmaker

733
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,720
Wow terminology there your ancestor is

734
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Is bizarre

735
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,888
Angela Stanton King of the conspiracy person who happens to also talk a lot about supporting Criminal Justice Reform

736
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
I

737
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Think that's great

738
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,104
Disagree with the notion that the justice system needs a lot of work I'm just not going to team up with people who Twitter qanon slogans

739
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,944
And his voice support for the idea that Wayfair is selling kids and couches

740
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Yeah

741
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Anyway she ran unopposed

742
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,624
For the GOP Primary in the 5th District race in Georgia in the 2020 election

743
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
She lost in the general with almost

744
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
An impressively bad

745
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,304
Number 14.9 per cent of the vote to her opponent

746
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
85.1

747
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
This was of course due to election fraud

748
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
According to reputable sources

749
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
I particularly those named Angela Stanton

750
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Sure

751
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
So yeah

752
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Hey

753
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Did they steal the election

754
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Just ask

755
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
Mead Mead

756
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
So here was something that I had to bring

757
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Under the table

758
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
What is

759
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
It's on equality Act

760
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
Our children

761
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
In Harm's Way

762
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Amazing

763
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
I can listen to you all day

764
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
Has not signed the equality Act

765
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
It would likely die

766
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,480
An identical Bill HR

767
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,856
The same bill was introduced into Congress before that titled HR 2282 and it died in committee

768
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
You're not going to believe this Jordan but same bill was introduced

769
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,000
The Congress before that title hr3

770
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
5-minute timer committee why would they keep numbering it different than everybody knows that it starts at 6

771
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,264
66 is the lazy game these scammers are playing and

772
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,104
It's getting a little old yeah the grift is really repetitive

773
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
It's disappointing

774
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
So Alex

775
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
I had some complaints about the media

776
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
I have to assume that when he says the media he means us

777
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
I'm guess

778
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,648
Cuz I don't know if I've ever heard anyone else but us make this

779
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Compliant

780
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Why say

781
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
5 / prepared for something

782
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
That's not a joke

783
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
The media always

784
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,936
I got too much to cover here

785
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,640
Yeah I don't I don't know if I've heard anybody talk about it but we talked about it incessantly

786
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,224
Is amazing how unprepared

787
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
And that is a documented fact

788
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,600
Insanely documented

789
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
Documenting things

790
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
But we have ever done

791
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:57,024
It might be one of the larger themes accidentally of our show

792
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
What can laziness do for you so Alex

793
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
But this isn't love

794
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Beginning of the third hour

795
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
10 minutes left

796
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
What

797
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
What is happening

798
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
So this is what happened

799
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
This is where I was like

800
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,200
This guy is innovative I'm f****** amazing

801
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,296
Chelsea is all over TV and now everyone is regurgitating the LIE

802
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
That

803
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Ninety-nine percent of the

804
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
I'm covid

805
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,256
You can spend 30 second

806
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Can I go to the US

807
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Government phone numbers

808
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
Almost 50%

809
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Are in the vaccinated

810
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Right

811
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,408
Fox and CNN and all of them

812
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,760
Repeating the same lie over and over again

813
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
Special shows

814
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
Emergency broadcast I don't know what we're going to call this

815
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
So I can go live

816
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
You want to just buy shove it

817
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Okay see you again

818
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,016

819
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
What is happening

820
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Here's what's happening

821
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
I'm impressed with Angela Stanton

822
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
And I'm invite her back

823
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Text Mark Cummins

44 days

825
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Amazing

826
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Reschedule

827
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,336
They're coming back there was

828
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Especially

829
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,944
Emergency reporting

830
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
I got Fox and CNN parroting all this b******* so I can't even get to her right now they're all

831
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
Call just parroting pouches and rescheduled

832
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:08,608
Doctors doctors appointment in the middle of the second hour to take a personal hour

833
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Off of work

834
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
The work that I do

835
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:17,568
Yeah that is only 3 hours literally two possibilities one is it when the show started he knew he had to go to a doctor's

836
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Appointment

837
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
It got rescheduled while he's on air

838
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,456
That's an amazing doctor

839
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
We can fit you in like that

840
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
And a really chaotic workplace

841
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
I think his needs better organization

842
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,928
It must be a very serious

843
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,584
If you're going to do and you didn't know prior to and it started

844
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,936
The other option is that Alex knew when the show started that he was going to be leaving

845
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
In the middle or beginning of

846
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
And if that was the case then you shouldn't have spent all that time digging around with the project Veritas dude about Hasbro

847
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Having having

848
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
Critical race Theory nonsense

849
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
Paul Joseph Watson talking bulshit

850
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
Anza Angeles dance

851
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,367
Adam King just talkin more nonsense

852
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:07,231
Like I didn't get your f****** news he had all the time in the world

853
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Seem like

854
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
The news that he is

855
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
Presenting himself as having

856
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,727
Which disagrees with all known available knowledge regardless

857
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
Vaccinations and death by covid

858
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
If that is 50

859
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
B15

860
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
That's the most important

861
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
News in the world right now

862
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,991
This literal most important news of the world

863
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,855
Well I like I'm not I can look into things as much as I can and I can

864
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Find the stories about

865
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
Vaccines

866
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,999
Veritiv

867
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Pizzava

868
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,655
I've been texting her hospitalization put like unless he actually covers the story he's refusing to cover

869
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
I can't do anything I don't know what he

870
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
He's talking about

871
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
Well I think he's talking about made up stuff

872
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
That is going to never come out

873
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
So we go to the 21st because

874
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
At this point as I was listening I'm sorry I ruined it already that I don't know what that lawsuit that he was talking about

875
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,951
Okay okay during about something

876
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
Yeah I know I don't know

877
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
He did

878
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
An impressive job of not talking about the things that he has sensibly wants to being a couple of of little Clues

879
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
Talk about this later

880
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
Yeah it's a nice annoying

881
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Eli can we get some clarity on that

882
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Would you not

883
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
But he has another bombshell

884
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,527
12 Monkeys

885
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Play dram

886
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,903
In the world in London England

887
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
Bauer he went on TV

888
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,095
And said that the inoculations for covid-19

889
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
Pfizer

890
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
But he studies and runs the program on

891
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
Studying those are vaccinated around the world

892
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,079
He says it will get rid of your immune system and give you 16

893
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
The immune system you had previously

894
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Oh no you're going to need

895
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
Every month

896
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Every month

897
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
This gets rid of your

898
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,159
I'm HIV

899
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
But it doesn't

900
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
Destroys

901
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Your body's immune system

902
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
They've committed

903
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,375
This bombshell story about covid

904
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
Match the clues about the bomb shelter

905
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
From yesterday

906
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
He was teasing

907
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
I'm getting pissed

908
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
It's very different bombshell

909
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
We've got a lot of Bombshells happening all around us juggling

910
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,919
There's this is the Blitz

911
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,527
Anyway this story is talking about involve some comments that he's taken out of context

912
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
A guy named David Bauer

913
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
Power is a researcher at the Francis Crick

914
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,719
Matutinal on-demand was leading a team that was researching the Pfizer vaccines at

915
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
Efficacy against other strains

916
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
But if emerged

917
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,191
The research was resort with centered around assessing levels of neutralizing antibodies that people had against

918
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
The strain

919
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,055
And I'm just going to read you hear from a write-up about his research in WebMD

920
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,383
And see if you can figure out where Alex took his bulshit from

921
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,223
Please wait until the the quote is done alright then raise your hand

922
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,527
Okay tell me where the b******* okay okay

923
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
This is a fun exercise

924
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,927
The team compared the concentrations of the neutralizing antibodies among the various

925
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
They found the people who lived

926
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,607
Fully vaccinated with to Weiser doses had antibodies that were six times lower against the B 16-17

927
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
Five times lower against the B 1351 variant

928
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,543
And 2.6 * lower against the b-117.

929
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
When compared to the original strain

930
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
You get the b*******

931
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,855
So what's going on is that Alex is taking the stairs research which is shown a potential concern that the Pfizer vaccine May provide

932
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,927
6 * lower antibody levels against one variant as opposed

933
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
The original virus

934
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
Alex is reporting that is this guy saying that covid vaccines Wipeout 5c

935
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Six of your nudes

936
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,399
So total b*******

937
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
A fantastic way of two

938
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
Describing I'm sorry I didn't give you a chance to respond to sad

939
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:12,223
A very sad that is a day that the vaccine designed for the original variant

940
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,551
It's very good at the original Barrett it is in 6 times

941
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
Antibodies for new variants only up only of these neutralizing antibodies is it Pacific

942
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
Type of antibody that does not mean that it is 16

943
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
Effective

944
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
In totality again

945
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
These other stores

946
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:35,263
Nor does it mean that you have 1/6 of your immune system

947
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,895
No it's not like antibodies are one thing and they fight off everything

948
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
It's a rager

949
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
This is very dumb

950
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
Deep down in his brain

951
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
Alex thinks that white blood cells

952
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
AR

953
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,439
Basically the same little tanks from those Atari games that fired little

954
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
At evil viruses and that's all it is pronounced

955
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
White blood cells

956
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
At the best blood cells

957
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,959
I realize that this is why this doesn't work disorders like exercise doesn't work

958
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
At like a dozen an educational environment it cuz it

959
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
It's disappointing

960
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:14,943
It's a bummer

961
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
This is just pathetic levels of intentional misrepresentation

962
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
Sentation on Alex's Park

963
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
It's even

964
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
Disappointingly transparent

965
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
For him

966
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,927
Like I honestly was like oh wow this is

967
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,023
You would have thought you would have to be either incredibly stupid

968
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
To misunderstand it this way

969
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:36,447
Or both Craven and Incredibly stupid to use that misunderstanding this way

970
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Shameless

971
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
To not think like

972
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
People can see through this really easily discussion of Bowers findings online

973
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
I'm going back to early June

974
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
This isn't news Alex probably just saw a tweet about it recently decided

975
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
Need to stop the goddamn presents

976
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Oh my God

977
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Let's soda

978
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Pickleball

979
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Now I will say

980
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
When I heard this I thought

981
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,911
I had a huge rainstorm yesterday and I did

982
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,471
7 hours of research yesterday evening

983
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Bulshit

984
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Until 3:30 in the

985
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Diamond Princess

986
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
Okay so Alex was up all night researching

987
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,455
I know that mode I know that mine

988
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
I've been there

989
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
That's the type of mindset you love movie Alex isn't coming with some Dan on it solutely I think

990
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:32,255
Maybe Alex is finally learning he's listening to you are criticisms about his

991
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
Quote over preparedness so perhaps he's like you know what this time I'm going to do some Dan on this I'm going to have

992
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
Some real

993
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,983
What I love is that he was over-prepared

994
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
To do his show on

995
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Tuesday

996
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,919
And you failed to get to any of that news

997
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Now he's on Wednesday

998
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,063
Is over prepared once again about a completely different topic

999
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
It's crazy what a dick

1000
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
You can use

1001
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
Could you now I'm going to throw this out

1002
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
If you were over prepared for one show

1003
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,887
Could you not use that preparation for then perhaps the next to

1004
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
You wouldn't even have to do any more work

1005
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
No

1006
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
No cuz you got to keep running

1007
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Well that's fair

1008
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,151
These bulshit stories will not fly tomorrow

1009
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,295
Only work today to your grandma today or you going to do whenever

1010
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,367
They only for shelf life for the stuff is

1011
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Real short

1012
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,487
So Alex plays the clip I want to play all of the clip that Alex plays

1013
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,071
David Bauer

1014
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
In its original form

1015
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,423
You can actually even find it at the Raw

1016
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:49,055
Unedited version of it where is like spell your name

1017
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,127
It's clear he's being asked about variance

1018
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
You can tell the clips

1019
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Starts in a particular place

1020
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
So that context is DeVore

1021
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Here's just a small

1022
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,743
Message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the Pfizer van

1023
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,791
Taxi in those who had two doses

1024
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
How about

1025
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,375
526 fold lower amounts of

1026
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
Neutralizing antibody

1027
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
Gold standard

1028
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Private security

1029
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
Antibodies of your immune system

1030
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,639
Virus from getting into your cells in the first place

1031
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
So we found it

1032
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,735
Southwest for people with to do since we've also found that

1033
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
For people with only one dose of the Pfizer job

1034
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,391
They are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies

1035
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
In their blood

1036
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,487
And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward

1037
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
Is that we see that

1038
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
The older you are

1039
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,351
Don't lower your levels are likely to be

1040
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
The time since you had your second job

1041
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
Has that time goes on

1042
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
The lower your levels are also like

1043
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
That's telling us that we're probably going to be needing to

1044
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,895
Prioritize boosters for older more vulnerable people

1045
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,431
Coming up soon specially if

1046
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
Disney variants

1047
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
And

1048
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Wow

1049
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,815
Wow wow wow

1050
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:19,167
Just a big ol while guys

1051
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:25,567
Completely out of context clip even within it has him very specifically describing antibodies for differ

1052
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,103
Turnbury at that one specific

1053
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Yep

1054
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
So

1055
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
Wow

1056
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,807
High tide has the flu will kill us all just don't even know man like

1057
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
This is

1058
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
This is pathetic

1059
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
I know I don't want to like

1060
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Really just

1061
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Be overly glib

1062
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
But even for me

1063
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
You feel like

1064
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
I'm punching under my weight class

1065
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,471
Video2 deceptive

1066
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,567
Oh well here's what's interesting about this

1067
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Nope that doesn't pass muster

1068
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,991
To add insult to that injury

1069
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
We had to open the show listening to them smugly describe how right they were about everything

1070
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
Manor sanctimonious prick so

1071
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
F****** b*******

1072
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
That's well

1073
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
I have to listen to me like how does it feel to be Vindicated

1074
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
There's a lot of

1075
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
Things that are repetitive beat

1076
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,263
About everything

1077
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Charanda oh we got another one

1078
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,615
If we get if we get a third we got a hat-trick okay

1079
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,503
Well this is definitely going to be the most important broadcast of my 27 years on air

1080
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,087
By the grace of God and your incredible prayers and support

1081
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
We are still in

1082
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,951
This position to fight back against these monsters

1083
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,511
All of you

1084
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
Yeah man most important. Cast of his career

1085
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,911
Broadcast he was up till 3 in the morning and he found a weird clip on

1086
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Twitter

1087
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
Cool boy

1088
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,287
Yeah I can see him staying up till 3:30 just

1089
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Like

1090
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
Down in a bottle of whiskey you just

1091
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,663
Progressively angrier

1092
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Twitter clips

1093
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Sinbad life

1094
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,063
Sure and then he's there for the next day

1095
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,391
Most important broadcast man is awesome

1096
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,231
I want to believe that this is true

1097
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:24,095
Like I really want to believe that this is his actual experience and guy but I'm not positive I can

1098
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Canntrust

1099
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
I want it to be

1100
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
I got home yesterday at dinner with the family my daughter want to go to bed early the youngest daughter about 8 so I went into my office

1101
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591

1102
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
1 a.m.

1103
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
When I went and got the bed

1104
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
And then I

1105
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
Could not stop

1106
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Stop playing

1107
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,903
God said get back up and get back on the computer

1108
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,207
Jumping around everywhere

1109
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
And and

1110
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Information

1111
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
Here today

1112
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,191
I love this idea so Alex is trying to go to bed and he's laying there and he just

1113
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Can't stop praying

1114
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
This connection to God will not close

1115
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
Annie hears the voice of the Divine

1116
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
The Divine reaches

1117
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
Across the fabric of the universe to him and it says

1118
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,759
Cruise the web Alex Cruz

1119
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,063
Find something weird on Twitter

1120
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
You know who else you know what

1121
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,791
Here's a what practices that little store God told me to pay here's what happened to that

1122
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
Story right before it began

1123
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,167
I did a bunch of Meth

1124
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
Then my job that's them what that's how you get into its 1 and I can't stop praying I have a where you get

1125
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
I have a working Theory

1126
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:45,247
This might have something to do with the doctor's appointment

1127
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:52,415
I think Isaac baby I hope Steph

1128
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
If you f***** up on this episode

1129
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,911
These weird be prayed till 3 in the morning and that God told him to search the internet.

1130
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,983
About anybody.

1131
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,799
Reporting as I can

1132
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
60 mm system

1133
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
What's my password

1134
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,855
Sometimes sometimes even

1135
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
Even my cynical self it breaks

1136
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
Through and I remember we live in a weird place

1137
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
True

1138
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,279
Here's some money or some big nose

1139
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
I began to research off

1140
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Clip

1141
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
Trudeau

1142
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
Chinese dictator

1143
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,079
Walk down up there

1144
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,247
Forced booster shots

1145
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,343
Why do pork brisket

1146
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,391
They go back to giving you two year

1147
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,231
Pause whatever quote Pfizer wants to put in

1148
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
More research

1149
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
I wonder who's your wreck

1150
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,143
Acting this project

1151
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
So I looked up

1152
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,007
The project of how to Twitch

1153
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Cyber-shot

1154
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
I found

1155
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,895
Pfizer employee who heads up the project

1156
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,479
For the main level 4 bioweapons lab in London England

1157
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
They'll be telling you about

1158
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,319
I watched

1159
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
Videos

1160
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Doesn't

1161
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,767
By the time I was done my job was on the ground

1162
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Alex did none of those

1163
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
Clips on Twitter 100

1164
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,751
Read dozens of David Bowers papers

1165
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
You just making up

1166
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Is prudential's and like

1167
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,871
Oh he's in charge of tweaking the vaccine

1168
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,783
Nonsense I love his habit

1169
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
Quote in in the wrong spot

1170
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
You know like

1171
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,439
Whatever quote Pfizer wants to put in you

1172
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
What

1173
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Where

1174
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,375
We're going to pull the quote Pfizer wants to put in you

1175
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
Visors not really their name

1176
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,103
Kaiser wants to put you

1177
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
Cuz it says quote

1178
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,919
So it has to be a quote

1179
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
You can't be

1180
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,503
Oh no I thought that the quotes were like

1181
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Quote-unquote Elites

1182
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,415
You know like whenever you're saying like something isn't really what the

1183
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:36,255
Quote Pfizer you think it was scared quotes

1184
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:40,095
Right around by the scotch

1185
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,399
The devil

1186
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Sarah quote

1187
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
Alex gets into some mind-blowing chicken van

1188
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
So

1189
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
You don't

1190
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
Canada

1191
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
Can afford to get booster shots right

1192
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,551
Tweaking the program whose

1193
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Squeaking

1194
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,135
The Pfizer vaccine right in order to

1195
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,415
Get everything right

1196
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,303
It's this guy right now I'm speaking I will I need to find out who's tweaking I read all his papers and guess what

1197
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
It goes so much deeper how much

1198
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
Henrietta Lacks

1199
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
That we told you about

1200
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
Is black woman

1201
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,359
They got eaten alive by cancer in one week

1202
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Stolen

1203
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,759
And it's the basis of all

1204
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
Human cloning

1205
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Everything today

1206
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
The cells won't die

1207
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:37,183
Herself

1208
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:41,535
Are you oh my God I didn't know they cloned her

1209
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:47,167
You 1966

1210
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
In 1966

1211
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Alright

1212
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
Okay we are

1213
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:56,127
You seen the saying we're like jumps on things and eat some total at what age

1214
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,687
I don't believe it's human

1215
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,247
Doesn't have our genome doesn't work chromosome

1216
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:05,599
Short another species

1217
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,719
I'm show you Wikipedia and imma show you the actual.

1218
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Okay

1219
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
This little Feller right here

1220
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,263
They're putting Henrietta Lacks cells

1221
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Any

1222
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
And one other

1223
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,687
White baby that got a bored in the third trimester

1224
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
Also 60

1225
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,527
But she's from 1951

1226
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
So

1227
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,367
Ladies and gentlemen

1228
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,719
Sid the Science Fiction movie you went to sit down and eat some Milk Duds and pop

1229
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,279
Popcorn maker

1230
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,351
Yeah that one's that one's Wild

1231
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
Seems a little bit

1232
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,191
Weirder than normal

1233
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,079
Purcells won't die

1234
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
Alex what he's doing

1235
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,943
This is basically just would it's not worth it

1236
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
When you talk to somebody who

1237
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
Stayed up all night

1238
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
Gatlin

1239
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
A couple facts Miss

1240
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Like read them

1241
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:16,255
About something and then just spun a while drinking ramble out of it to blow your mind with some like Elementary

1242
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,327
Details about Immortal cell line

1243
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,727
Set the most famous Immortal cell line is the Hela cells name for Henrietta Lacks

1244
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
Scott African American woman who died in 1951

1245
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,407
Researchers studying the cells collected from her cervical cancer sample discovered

1246
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
But instead of dying as

1247
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
Expected they would

1248
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
Continue to replicate

1249
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Essentially forever

1250
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
Never die it's okay

1251
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,367
Concentrate

1252
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:47,743
How old is breakthroughs in all manner of scientific Fields we're testing couldn't be done on hue

1253
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Subject

1254
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,119
And one of the largest problems is actually Alex is right about it they did steal it

1255
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:58,239
Like it didn't have nothing planned it's really f***** up

1256
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,799
Yeah it was accidentally right about that

1257
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,687
These Hela cells are pretty remarkable but they're not unique and they're not alien an orgy

1258
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,295
There's a product of mutation which is not super uncommon in cases of

1259
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Cancer

1260
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,415
There's a line of cells called The Jerk hat cells which began from a 14 year old

1261
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
T-cell leukemia

1262
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
There other human immortalized cell line

1263
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,535
Plenty of other animal one

1264
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Comes to

1265
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,703
The fetus related cells you bringing up our the HEK cells and those come from a fetus that could have been aborted or possibly

1266
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Play miscarried

1267
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Sheriff not entirely sure

1268
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
That's all I didn't begin in the lights

1269
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
60's hits

1270
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
Was 1973

1271
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,663
Alex's just like

1272
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:42,271
I guess you skimmed Wikipedia article about this and he is just like oh my God they're going to put

1273
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,063
These zombie cells in you

1274
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
It's pretty silly

1275
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Love that

1276
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,999
Love it I love it they clone Durand 19-6

1277
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
56th and

1278
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
They cloned ER

1279
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Where's my clock

1280
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,119
That's not important

1281
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
Will she die

1282
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Never exclude her from the immortal cell

1283
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,079
Ourselves

1284
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Become immortal

1285
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
I don't know

1286
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
So Alex's makes up some details about Henrietta Lacks cuz I think he's just

1287
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Oh

1288
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Oh

1289
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,623
The Henrietta

1290
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
Backstory

1291
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,439
Guess what comes out of

1292
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
And the human party

1293
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
Tuskegee Alabama

1294
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
With everything

1295
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,847
Is it made up on the spot

1296
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,639
Henrietta was from Virginia

1297
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,175
But you moved to Maryland after get

1298
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Getting married

1299
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Johns Hopkins

1300
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,063
To have her cancer dealt with because they were the only hospital around those parts

1301
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Treated black people

1302
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
At the time

1303
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,695
I love to do with Tuskegee but Alex is just

1304
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,303
Flying off the wall to pick up everything really sending it out

1305
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
Of course this does lead

1306
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
2

1307
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,423
Some Grim prediction

1308
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,263
Defense is right now for extermination

1309
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,335
It's a powerful yahrzeit. Actually put this

1310
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
I mean

1311
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,967
And I guess we're going to join all the aborted babies now

1312
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
Going to be at work

1313
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,903
When the viruses in the mutation

1314
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
Doing this to us

1315
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
Sarah Goode die this fall

1316
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
I mean

1317
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,727
I would have done that LaFontaine voice

1318
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,007
Oregon with it

1319
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
This fall

1320
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,335
The death of

1321
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,687
No I think he'll leave that to Gregory

1322
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,759
Has more of a voiceover things going on

1323
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,343
I'm pretty basic misunderstanding

1324
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,135
Things about these Hela cells

1325
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
And here's another one

1326
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,255
I don't care if you're in the Navy or you're a farmer

1327
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,839
Military school teacher

1328
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,887
I don't care who you are this is going to get

1329
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
You're not getting out of this

1330
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
You're not getting out of this

1331
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Helium

1332
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,479
Vaccine

1333
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
Henrietta Lacks

1334
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
Whatever ate her

1335
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
That's whatever 8

1336
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,135
Henrietta Lacks

1337
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
Is all of the vax

1338
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,975
Is pretty disturbing

1339
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
So

1340
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
Whatever 8 Henrietta Lacks

1341
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Text

1342
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
Is in all the facts

1343
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
It's the only way to interpret this is that Alex thinks that henrietta's cancer was in fact an alien ended 8

1344
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:48,127
How the immortal cell line that came from her is that alien reproducing

1345
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,967
Another Global as they're putting that alien cell line into vaccines for something

1346
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Nefarious

1347
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
I'm going to throw this out

1348
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
Haha

1349
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,855
I disagree with everything Alex's said

1350
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,903
About what he did the night

1351
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
Before

1352
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,743
He stayed up watching the trailer for Carnage

1353
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,535
I'm just mistook Venom

1354
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,839
For Henrietta Lacks is murderer he took some

1355
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,423
Sunbeam had some fun

1356
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,799
This is painfully dumb and I'm kind of worried that Alex should have just taken the day off

1357
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,639
I have no idea what's going on why he went to the doctor but he seems

1358
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
He was like

1359
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,223
He seems a little different than normal

1360
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,271
This feels like somebody who's just

1361
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
Grabbing whatever like

1362
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
It like right now in my eyes

1363
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,159
His his brain is just a bunch

1364
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Lights

1365
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,999
Rolling around and he's just grabbing whatever pops out

1366
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
And he's just like this

1367
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
This works

1368
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,119
Throws makes less sense than normal

1369
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,935
Whatever

1370
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
Whatever 8 Henrietta

1371
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
That was school's out to break with that

1372
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Alien

1373
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,943
Alien ships going idiot I don't disagree

1374
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,271
I think it's called

1375
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,087
So here's how

1376
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
Come back from break

1377
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
Everyone's being injected

1378
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,047
What cellular product

1379
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,631
Mortal shell on black woman

1380
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
1951

1381
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,215
Is that your biggest problem

1382
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
Human cells

1383
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Different genome

1384
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Botanica

1385
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
Ate her

1386
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
In a week

1387
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,551
Only found one of their human they admit

1388
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
Aborted

1389
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
Baby

1390
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,511
Out of here with your War of the Worlds

1391
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,119
True

1392
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,543
Also I don't have the scientific credibility to discuss the actual process for it but you can create your own immortalized

1393
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,943
So why don't you want to it's not magic or some kind of alien she just seems like it when you have

1394
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Haven't slept

1395
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831
It's just that simple

1396
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
Yeah

1397
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Yeah

1398
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Sunnyway if you forgot this

1399
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
You got off on this

1400
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Alien

1401
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,375
Tumor thing or magical world right now

1402
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
Then I think he's used to

1403
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:26,079
Dude I mean specifically at this at this episode he's living in a magical world where whatever

1404
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
800

1405
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
BoBoiBoy I'm concerned that he lives in that state

1406
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,991
Much more regularly

1407
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:39,391
He's good at disguising it about

1408
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:45,791
You should beat like he should be listening back to the show while holding a brown bag and then like look at it and toss it in the car

1409
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,095
But you know like this is the level of like

1410
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
Oh boy these pink elephants are attic

1411
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
Control

1412
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
So if you forgotten

1413
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,239
He's got off on talking about this

1414
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,775
Immortal cell line

1415
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:00,895
Alien origin story is this David Bauer guy

1416
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
Who works at the Francis

1417
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Put yes

1418
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
Caribbean system

1419
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Take me to Pfizer vaccine

1420
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
Hey man I got to say

1421
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,695
Course of this episode over trying to put a Target on somebody

1422
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
He couldn't do much better job than he is

1423
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,607
David LV

1424
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,239
The program at the bioweapons lab in London England

1425
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,055
Started the first shots

1426
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
He studies their blood

1427
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,455
See what happens when he has the project up

1428
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
Telling you

1429
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Reduces your immune system

1430
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Massively

1431
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
In the future

1432
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,791
The key message from our finding

1433
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,191
Just plays the same clip again here is that like

1434
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,239
The only kind of attention you're going to bring

1435
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,519
Towards this person

1436
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
Is going

1437
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
Going to be people accusing him

1438
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,127
I'm saying the things that Alex is claiming

1439
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Decide which

1440
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
He didn't

1441
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
He will say

1442
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,503
I didn't say that that's not at all truth

1443
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Now he's part of

1444
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
The cover-up

1445
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
And

1446
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,135
Just it's just a really negative cycle

1447
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
Perpetuated

1448
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,999
The easy explanation for it is Alex

1449
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
You're wrong

1450
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
This is absolutely wrong

1451
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
This is not what you said

1452
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
Stop you need to

1453
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
So long retract

1454
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
Action isn't good enough

1455
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,799
A lifelong Richard

1456
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,079
Yeah

1457
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,943
The next Republican escape this cuz it's just with the part of the episode where he says that

1458
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,527
The people that the bombshell from the previous day or can I go now

1459
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,319
Great love it love it

1460
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,367
Science might be close to death though

1461
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,951
Well that means the way you stalking right now it seems

1462
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
No no no no no

1463
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
You got a wrong

1464
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,791
We're talking murder map

1465
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
Pressure here

1466
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
You need to go research the song yourself

1467
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,423
How many times did I take the Rockefeller Foundation

1468
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
Runs Gates runfalcon

1469
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,263
Boys

1470
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
Cuz they're losing right now

1471
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
They want to attack but they know it's not going well

1472
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,895
Rock Stepside

1473
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,431
Now the big boys throwing up

1474
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
And believe it or not right over the button and

1475
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,903
You tell him it's going to make him bigger don't do it they're having debates the boardroom

1476
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
And

1477
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
That's fine

1478
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,511
You're all going to be good so to anyways

1479
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
I'm talking about all the Lister

1480
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
You guys are right

1481
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,471
Robinson

1482
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
True Blood

1483
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
Main reason

1484
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,383
That Obi-Wan became more powerful in death was

1485
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
As a

1486
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Assistant

1487
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
To Luke

1488
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
You know as somebody who can

1489
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
Continue to guide him

1490
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,855
Him further that's ensuring The Inevitable Defeat

1491
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,391
Of Darth Vader

1492
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Rights

1493
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,695
Now here's the thing

1494
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
About

1495
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,279
Debating whether or not killing Alex will make him stronger

1496
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
His Luke

1497
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
Skywalker is

1498
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
Owen Shroyer

1499
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,423
You get rid of him buddy it's all gone

1500
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,775
Yeah I think that maybe there's a disturbing

1501
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:12,127
Benson the force

1502
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,527
Hasn't been picked up yet or something baby it is somebody out there that Alex's

1503
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,807
Force ghost

1504
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
Yeah I don't know I think

1505
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
That notion of like

1506
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
These shadowy globalist

1507
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,791
S2r my Arch Rivals for the last 30 years

1508
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,863
They just don't kill me because if they did it would prove

1509
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
Give me right about everything

1510
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,447
It's just dumb

1511
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,263
It sounds convincing people who have already bought in

1512
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
Enough to be like

1513
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:45,919
Yeah you're right about everything sure you don't believe any of it

1514
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
It's not persuasive at all

1515
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,551
You know it's sitting right in the f****** boardroom being like let's kill Alex Jones

1516
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,623
Probably think about no never

1517
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,975
But even the even in his like just judging by normal human behavior

1518
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:04,607
Even in the circumstance that the one point in time there was a boardroom being like sugar

1519
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
That's a

1520
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
1

1521
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
One gomita

1522
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,727
You know either you do or you don't

1523
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:15,871
Alex hasn't done anything different in the past 20 years you know if they were going to do it they would have already done it

1524
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,687
There's no point now you got a you got to think

1525
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Ya think

1526
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
That would

1527
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
And

1528
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Let's not forget

1529
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
Did the people who would be killing our

1530
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Yes

1531
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Work for the

1532
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
That's true

1533
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
They have they have so much restraint

1534
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,679
Call Jee advanced

1535
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,751
From anything that we even know they could make this death look

1536
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:49,151
Any kind of way they wanted to Henrietta Lacks at any point in time

1537
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,503
Cancer blow darts

1538
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,527
Emergency

1539
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,135
Could be an army of henrietta's ready to kill Alex at any point in time

1540
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,439
Stupid

1541
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Stupid and embarrassed

1542
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,303
Yep so anyway Alex has some new money coming into the show

1543
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,607
Isis Isis for you they are

1544
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,167
Devil's children

1545
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Dream

1546
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
The energy Lee Anderson

1547
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
In Dark Crystal it's all an allegory

1548
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,615
Tell me about a break I'm going to ask you all remember

1549
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,687
Broadcast possible when you go to my pillow.

1550
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:27,295
Tom

1551
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
There are

1552
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,111
They wanna promo codes

1553
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,695
Okay so you get link on my pillow now

1554
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Brewery

1555
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Bruno

1556
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:40,607
Both have fallen

1557
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,167
Two windows to shake hands they both

1558
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,727
Dig a little bit deeper in the air bottomless pit

1559
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Yeah it's

1560
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,823
It's sort of the same as Nick Fuentes and Alex working

1561
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
Together it's like

1562
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,223
Possibly be happy about this

1563
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,063
Geode swamp territory like they read like you have

1564
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,111
To go into the dark.

1565
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
Set the bar

1566
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,439
IU bv3 monsters

1567
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:09,535
Like a f****** Bigfoot's in the wild now by the way

1568
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,351
We did that episode earlier in the week about

1569
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,887
Nick Fuentes video about

1570
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:19,007
Maintaining the white demographic little update on that info

1571
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,823
The title on that video

1572
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,407
Now it's the same video

1573
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
The title says America must

1574
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,527
Preserve its core demographic wow wow

1575
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:35,135
You got to the bottom of what the problem was

1576
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,183
They forgot to change the thumbnail

1577
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,583
You know the thing you should changes the existence of

1578
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:48,959
The video that's the major issue there because the title apparently not is also

1579
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Substance of Davido

1580
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
See it is

1581
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
Here's what's fascinating about this

1582
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
It shows

1583
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
But there is some sort of editorial review it Infowars

1584
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,527
They did something there was a conversation about like

1585
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,671
But instead of recognizing the title is reflective of the content

1586
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:13,791
Maybe we shouldn't have this content

1587
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:24,031
Alright our company murdered millions of people but now we're a different name

1588
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,359
Grey-headed job Bandit video

1589
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
Dickwad a culture is out of control why can't Nick Fuentes speak

1590
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,319
Are you afraid are you in a war on

1591
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,367
Are you afraid of the word white Alex

1592
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,927
I feel like Alex is afraid of white p

1593
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:46,047
I think I think he is just as well realizes that white

1594
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
People

1595
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Just can't be

1596
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Never thought I'd see the day

1597
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,983
So Alex rest a little bit here about David Bauer

1598
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,311
It's not about seeing it's a gene therapy

1599
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,103
That gets rid of your immune system

1600
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Only

1601
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Hell

1602
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,199
And by the way that's not even tonight

1603
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:08,063
Advisor

1604
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,599
For the UK government

1605
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,023
What is your 16 and what it was and only

1606
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
Zbrush your life

1607
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
I want a Pfizer comes up with

1608
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
The study

1609
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
The he heads up

1610
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,007
At the most prestigious facility

1611
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
UK

1612
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,335
Probably the world

1613
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,175
The Institute

1614
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,295
UK's bio-weapon facilities there Fort Detrick Maryland

1615
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
DNA

1616
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
Along with a W and goddesses blacks on humans

1617
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,231
So this is a really nice group of people

1618
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:58,239
You free associating a little more than marble

1619
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,823
Is in-between scattershot

1620
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,431
So also now David Bauer isn't just a researcher at this Francis Crick Institute

1621
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:11,039
I guess Alex is promoted into the position of supervisor or something

1622
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:17,695
Feel like the way they sloppily throwing out random details should be a bit of a red flag he's also a player manager for the Oakland A's

1623
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
He's busy

1624
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,791
Like Danny Shea Graham

1625
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,351
Rambus yes

1626
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:30,751
Formerly the UK's big bioweapon lab whatever that means

1627
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,823
Beef stew was opened in 2016 and if Alex

1628
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,127
Cared at all about keeping his details straight

1629
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,711
You should know that he's already established and Infowars lore that port

1630
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,783
Down is the UK's giant evil by 11 lab

1631
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,671
That's literally what he called their Fort Detrick back in 2003 when he's trying to argue that they'd released footage

1632
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,695
Mouth disease

1633
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,791
Also whatever to saying is not only out of context

1634
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,327
It's also a complete lie

1635
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:59,167
You didn't read any of these studies and that's why he's not speaking in any specific

1636
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,215
It's about any of it pass yelling but he's ready

1637
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,007
Studies over and over again up

1638
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:06,335
These papers that were written by Baauer they're available on Francis Creek Inn

1639
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,615
Institute website so

1640
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
He wants that we're get into anything

1641
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,199
Specifically I'd be happy to

1642
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,991
Mix it up by

1643
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,551
I'm not going to go on a wild goose chase

1644
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
You'll likely scenario

1645
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,647
He hasn't read anything I know he's

1646
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:26,047
Read all of these studies I just assumed all eventually all figure out what Alex is talking about

1647
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,839
Many studies that have never come in handy

1648
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
I have

1649
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:32,191
I've played this game many a time and

1650
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,543
Come up wanting every time

1651
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,127
Good War Games you know yet sometimes the only way to win is not to play

1652
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,711
Generally also wanting our neck

1653
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Text gas shows up

1654
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
Robert Barr

1655
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
Dial God

1656
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
Dammit

1657
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
What is your dad

1658
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,415
Subway has comes on to complain about Trump

1659
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,231
Impotent social media lawsuit

1660
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,535
And how they need to do more

1661
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,631
Or something he's also mad at Black Rifle coffee

1662
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,703
Because apparently they don't support

1663
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
Kyle Rittenhouse

1664
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
Black Rifle coffee

1665
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,687
Talk to me Black Rifle coffee is

1666
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Is

1667
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,087
I mean when you talk about mtch

1668
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
When you talk about

1669
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:27,487
I will you talk about what's destroyed this country there the essence of

1670
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
That's all I'm saying is that

1671
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,375
With friends like this we don't need

1672
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Anyanime Speedway

1673
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:40,287
So what happened here is the Kyle Rittenhouse was pictured wearing a black rifle coffee t-shirt back in November

1674
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,823
Immediately the right-wing

1675
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Insisted that the coffee company should

1676
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Sponsor him

1677
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
They released a statement that said no

1678
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,783
F*** that murdering piece of s***

1679
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,903
Great and I was considerable backlash to them to be a company that would

1680
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
Right

1681
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:02,047
Recently one of the founders of the company didn't interview with the New York Times where he wrestled with his place in the mark

1682
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,375
How do you build a cool kind of irreverent

1683
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:10,751
Pro-second Amendment promerica Brandon the Maga Arrow without doubling down on the bog of movement

1684
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:16,128
Not being called a f****** Rhino by the Baga guys

1685
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:19,968
That's a real dilemma in my answer to that is you probably can't

1686
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
Your community let those s*** heads in because

1687
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
To do so is

1688
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,600
The easiest and cheapest way toward gaining power

1689
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,952
This is what happened yeah it's weird how everybody saw it coming

1690
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,232
The co-founder wet on

1691
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,048
The racism s*** really pisses me off

1692
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
I hate racist

1693
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,352
Proud boys people

1694
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,656
Like I'll pay them to leave my customer base

1695
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
I'll gladly chopped

1696
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
All these people out of my f******

1697
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,008
Customer database

1698
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
I pay them

1699
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,544
Get the f*** out

1700
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:49,664
I apologize if the problem is dude is facing but also big mistake about it keep corded Disick

1701
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
Exact audience

1702
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,248
The cleanup His Name by Jesse Valentine

1703
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Which is great

1704
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,320
Just probably take a little bit more work than this

1705
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:00,928
Probably squeal like a shity snake charmer was trying to complain about getting bitten by a snake

1706
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
I don't know how I'm supposed to care

1707
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,512
But now Alex is going to

1708
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,840
Virtue signal as far as Watson likes to say about how much he

1709
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
Hates Black Rifle coffee

1710
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,448
I am also make no mistake about this

1711
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Alex is using the

1712
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
Parsley at the way to plug his own cock

1713
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
Easy wind

1714
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:24,224
We hate this guy guess who does support the Second Amendment and

1715
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
That's right

1716
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,296
Are you I have zero patience

1717
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,624
Zero patience for a Nazi at a Nazi rally

1718
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
Being like

1719
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,976
You know this place would be great if there weren't all these f****** Nazis around

1720
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,120
I don't care what you have to say about the Maga people being mean to you I think

1721
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,680
F*** off I think that I do have

1722
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
Enough empathy

1723
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,008
If the person

1724
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,800
Realization

1725
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Changes

1726
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
If they leave

1727
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
That rally

1728
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,968
And recognize you got to leave the Nazi rally Buhdeuce

1729
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,248
Hard soul-searching

1730
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,040
And what have you been

1731
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:05,952
Good on you I'm not going to this guy necessarily for have

1732
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,048
Having these feelings now there's a possibility that in a few years

1733
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
Do you know this process

1734
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,984
Will come to his needs to go remember saying how the early branding and playing into the culture

1735
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,080
Boerboel shed right all that stuff led to the point where he had the consumer-based

1736
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:26,688
But he does that is full of s*** head races to get mad if you don't support Kyle didn't

1737
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,224
The first thing that he has to wreck

1738
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
Nice courses

1739
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
He's here by because of him

1740
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,600
And not because his audience

1741
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,880
He chose this

1742
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,184
That's how it work before did that

1743
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
And it wasn't too that's really fascinating to me is like

1744
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,072
Things that Alex is really huge into is like

1745
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,096
Free association

1746
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,888
Have the right that you have

1747
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
One of the reasons

1748
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,472
Libertarian types

1749
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,776
It's often are opposed to civil rights

1750
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
Type of laws

1751
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,664
Hi because free-association just be able to do business with whoever you want

1752
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
If you don't want to

1753
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:02,528
Serve people of a certain race naturally you should be free to do that in the market

1754
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Playful sort that out

1755
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,832
Of course

1756
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:09,440
Free association is something that is at all meaningful to you

1757
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
I don't understand how you can have a company

1758
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,280
That was

1759
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,072
Was pressured into

1760
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,376
Possibly taking on a

1761
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Shooter

1762
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,936
As a

1763
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,752
They were sponsoring and they said no

1764
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,800
And then you want to boycott them

1765
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,104
For them not deciding to sponsor

1766
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
Someone who killed

1767
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,176
I don't understand how like that

1768
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
Can be something

1769
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,480
Make sure they have the right

1770
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,016
To sponsor whoever they want

1771
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
Fiat

1772
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
They should

1773
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,928
And the reason that they don't is because it makes these guys real butthole

1774
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Alex

1775
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:46,304
The people who are mad at them want to force them as a business can sponsor

1776
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,584
Somebody

1777
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,656
There should be free association

1778
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
For everybody

1779
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Well actually just for me

1780
01:23:55,008 --> 01:24:01,152
And then everybody else should do what I tell them to do and your business should be forced into associating with a

1781
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,944
The guy who shot some people

1782
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,552
So if I like him then you have to cuz that signals.

1783
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:12,416
Correct interest that lets me know and you know that were part of the same

1784
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
Tribes

1785
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,256
Very strange

1786
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
It's almost like it doesn't mean anything at all what they

1787
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
Speaking of things that don't mean anything at all

1788
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
It's time

1789
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Talk

1790
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,336
Is Leo

1791
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,872
He started the Church of Mesa

Fixing Zone

1793
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,736
911

1794
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:43,136
We have the Messiah. I forgot what episode it is but we didn't an episode we got deep on Leo zagami

1795
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
And I can't recommend it enough

1796
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,000
Excel good one of my favorite things that I have ever

1797
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,048
Just the house music

1798
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
Just starting at the house music alert Leo zagami was a rave DJ and Ezra

1799
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,264
Currently house explosion

1800
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,800
Explain how we got to here

1801
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,384
Music

1802
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,176
And it's not that bad

1803
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Leo zagami

1804
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:15,136
Whaleyville is flexing its muscles it's making its big run against humanity and taking over

1805
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:21,536
For every major institution we learn to trust and love

1806
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,608
Join us waited Leo zagami Dan surprise

1807
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:27,168
A war on conservative true Catholic

1808
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,728
That came out of nowhere for me cuz Alex didn't

1809
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
Tease this at all

1810
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,288
Whoa

1811
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:38,688
You didn't know they coming up we're going to have Leo zagami

1812
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,064
Man

1813
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
I warmed up

1814
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,160
Well it's what he's big

1815
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Grape is about

1816
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,792
Pope Francis recently putting up some new guidance about light

1817
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:59,936
Yeah yeah you you only say it in Latin and certain time. Then otherwise you trying

1818
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,520
The big change that he made was that

1819
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,616
You have to if you're a priest and you want to do Latin Mass

1820
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,896
You have to get

1821
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,176
By the permission of your piss

1822
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,992
And one of the reasons for this was

1823
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Because

1824
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,600
It was being used its kind of a signifier

1825
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,648
It was creating division Within

1826
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Catholic Community

1827
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:26,816
Oh so the people who did Latin Mass where the Conservative Catholics in the people who didn't do that.

1828
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,376
Them from kind of communicating with each other

1829
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,168
Right and so this new guy.

1830
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,520
Those put ours you need the permission of your Bishop in order to do Latin Masses

1831
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:41,408
That every Bishop is required to have places that do Latin Mass

1832
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,224
To cater to those folks

1833
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,272
It has to be available

1834
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
And

1835
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
You need to have

1836
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,600
Permission so it's not just

1837
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
Being done

1838
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:53,952
All over the place

1839
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
Right right

1840
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:01,120
So it's a very simple practical change that will have absolutely no effect on anything

1841
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
Which of course means

1842
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
Conservative Catholics are freaking

1843
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
The f*** out of

1844
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,288
Keep something that maybe is important to some people and I think there's an entry

1845
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,336
Discussion probably but it seems like

1846
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
When internal

1847
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,408
Organizational Catholic thing

1848
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
That I am not real

1849
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,760
Really too interested Intel

1850
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,320
Leo choking why they're doing it

1851
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,904
I mean what does it mean and the Original Latin

1852
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,976
Okay it means

1853
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,304
Essential

1854
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,608
Also for the exorcism

1855
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,400
Is in itself

1856
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,704
A form of exorcism

1857
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
The

1858
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
Francis has permitted

1859
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,896
The use of their traditional Latin Mass

1860
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Yes

1861
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Yeah man

1862
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
So the pups the devil

1863
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
Lesbian

1864
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,392
Demon can't hear Latin Mass

1865
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
Do they

1866
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,952
Do they know though

1867
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
That at the Vatican

1868
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Where he live

1869
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,376
Sometime

1870
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Look

1871
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Here's the deal

1872
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
Leo's weird

1873
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,616
I don't

1874
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920
Approved for my reading of it

1875
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,944
Pope hasn't been

1876
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
Latin Mass

1877
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
Which is what

1878
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
Leo Sayer

1879
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
That's just not true

1880
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:27,648
I do like the idea that he's selling it as it's an exorcism thing

1881
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,744
And every church service is essentially an exorcism but only if it's in life

1882
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Yeah

1883
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
Yeah

1884
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,888
I think we're in full-on magic words territory

1885
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,936
God speaks

1886
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Italian

1887
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,848
The guys God speaks the language of Italy in the past

1888
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,640
When God was

1889
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,688
Because that's where people started

1890
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,760
I forgot so God only uses magical Latin

1891
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
Just to be clear

1892
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,112
That God started in Italy

1893
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Also Alex

1894
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,976
Doesn't ask Leo about doing 911

1895
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,768
Really weird

1896
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,632
Every time Leo's on I'm waiting for that question cuz it's a hard-hitting question

1897
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
It should be for Alex

1898
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,704
Hey

1899
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
Leo

1900
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
You said you worked with other people's Health in Lawton

1901
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,824
Who did 9/11

1902
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,128
Thank you for it later you mean by that

1903
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
So I said it was an inside job

1904
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:31,392
And it kind of seems like you were inside so you want to you want to double-team this situation definitely

1905
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
What was meant by Inside Job

1906
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:35,232
Julio's

1907
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,304
So what are the things that is really important

1908
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
Here is that passports

1909
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
Bear the mark of the bee

1910
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,168
Sure until we have

1911
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:46,240
Have to do coding Tulio is with make insulated community

1912
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,800
We might not have that much time

1913
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:55,456
What should we have for example ready in France in Paris so that is Kleenex throughout of course

1914
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:01,600
Weed that excused they will eventually say we need to microchip you

1915
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,304
And eventually we have 24 is related communities

1916
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,448
They said there is no future

1917
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,824
What's the time

1918
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
If you don't know but

1919
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,712
What's the time frame of the end

1920
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,736
How are we going to survive

1921
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,976
Serological Warfare the second cyberwarfare Defenders nuclear warfare

1922
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,608
In the next nine years

1923
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,656
So we got time here

1924
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,984
So is point is

1925
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,312
Is because people like him who hate vaccines

1926
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,848
Are going to

1927
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,896
Forge vaccine passports

1928
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:01,504
The government in response to their inability to get vaccinated

1929
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,784
Will then

1930
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
Chip them

1931
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,088
Because

1932
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,368
Of their behavior

1933
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,160
So they are at

1934
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208
Bolts for the mark of the beast

1935
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,512
I don't know

1936
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,328
I was trying to listen to what you're saying and I just couldn't

1937
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,352
Stop thinking like

1938
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,168
Leo got vaccinated

1939
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
Of course he did

1940
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,728
Are you going to get hurt

1941
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
These people are all assholes

1942
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
How do you know

1943
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,592
Smartphones

1944
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
Whoa

1945
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,152
Smartphone

1946
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
Smart grid

1947
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:36,320
Wow sure everything well houses

1948
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,600
Smart houses

1949
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,880
Frigerators

1950
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:43,744
Smart fridges the refrigerator will adjust the temperature for you and then you can check Twitter on it

1951
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,584
I guess that sound smart but maybe it's not pretty smart mean something else

1952
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,448
The Weeknd

1953
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,008
Because all cities

1954
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,592
Winn-Dixie

1955
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,872
Eventually

1956
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:00,896
CDs

1957
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:05,248
And I've been saying this for a long time

1958
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,784
Edema

1959
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,880
Cool smart is actually satanic

1960
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
Anything

1961
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,256
Dady massmart

1962
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,840
Is actually a nice service

1963
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:27,008
And dependency from from Satan which ultimately he is the one behind

1964
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Our own

1965
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
EStudio reality

1966
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:41,600
Naturally

1967
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,928
Of course in the Book of Revelation with you also cited

1968
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,304
Is very important

1969
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,912
The moment in which we have accepted the vaccine at the moment in which

1970
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,544
We are basically at that point

1971
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,968
So this investigation is open

1972
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:12,320
Leo does believe he's fighting the literal devil

1973
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:18,208
He believes that by holding the phone that he's talking to Alex on he's through the devil

1974
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
Smart equals satanic

1975
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,536
I don't know

1976
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
How is he called

1977
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
I don't

1978
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,864
No it's on Skype

1979
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,680
I think so I don't know if there's a boar

1980
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,704
Succinct

1981
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:35,104
Explanation for Alex's worldview than things that are spotted are evil 100% it is a very

1982
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
Accurate

1983
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,456
I owe man so they so the devil

1984
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Is behind our phones

1985
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
How many days until chill

1986
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
I like the devil

1987
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
I like my phone

1988
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
I mean

1989
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,208
Straight play some apps on it it's good stuff

1990
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
Play some

1991
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Play some games

1992
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,048
Is devil behind

1993
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,840
The devil is behind

1994
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Everything

1995
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,656
Except that measurement

1996
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,680
App that allows you

1997
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,496
Need to see if Blake Shelton

1998
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,056
That well yeah but only God can make things level.

1999
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
That's true

2000
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,848
So

2001
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
We have the devil

2002
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,224
Now I got bad news

2003
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
There's another

2004
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
There's two Devils

2005
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,344
I was shocked to hear

2006
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:21,440
From your research who is Satan what is Satan I want to say one

2007
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,280
Satan and his Legion want our soul

2008
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,840
So they want the soulless Society

2009
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
After these three stages which

2010
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,568
Describe

2011

2019
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,080

I can't believe

2029
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
Alex doesn't like

2030
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,680
Just go home

2039
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,448
Think about public health over the last year

No it's everything's not going to be here till $20

2041

2042
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,080
Okay

2043
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
There's a lot of stats

2044
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152

01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
Until now

2048
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,928
Possession

2049
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:32,256
Literally possessing more and more pee

2050
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,352
Sundae maker Grease

01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:55,552
True modern technology

2056
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,368
In this book volume 666

2057
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,160

Okay that's the Fahrenheit 9/11

2060
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,656
Wrap up their interview and I

2061
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:14,240
Alex goes off on his merry way

2062
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Just was

2063
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:24,224
The introduction of cyber Satan into the pantheon is pretty important pretty good

2064
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,624
Every appearance he's just got one that he can talk that sometimes he's got nothing but bad

2065
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
That's not true

2066
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:39,584
Interview that he's done that I have not been told you about all really

2067
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,144
Generally will have one

2068
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:47,776
That's what that's what I would say generally there's one and then desert Wasteland

2069
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,824
Steve bats for the cycle

2070
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,616
He's he's getting he's getting

2071
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,152
Dreams on bass

2072
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:59,040
Steve Stevens Stevens the Adam Dunn of b******* it's either gone or it's a

2073
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,320
F****** bummer

2074
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,368
So this 21st

2075
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
Was strain

2076
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,256
Energy was real weird and

2077
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,536
I got a tip

2078
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,840
From person who

2079
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:15,424
I don't know if they would want me to use their name

2080
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,192
I appreciate the

2081
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,984
Cuz I don't watch the War Room

2082
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,520
But

2083
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,056
Alex showed back up

2084
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
No on the War Room

2085
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,152
Oh no the end of the world

2086
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112
American athletes shouldn't lose to another country at anything and now they're getting swept by Mike Nigeria

2087
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,648
Australia and Sweden

2088
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,184
Get woke

2089
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Dobro

2090
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,280
But the Babylonian bee

2091
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
As a

2092
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,376
They think they know what's behind this

2093
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:50,752
US Women's Soccer Team to boycott scoring until racism is defeated so clearly that's it

2094
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,056
Clearly that's it Alex don't you think

2095
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,128
Don't you think Alex

2096
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,664
He's hovering

2097
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
What you think about this Alex

2098
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:04,320
Journalist could face up to 14 years in prison for stories embarrassing

2099
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
The government

2100
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,904
So at this point Alex's wandered up

2101
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,928
Behind Owen

2102
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
Geeking out

2103
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
Behind him oh boy

2104
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,120
Cowboy cowboy

2105
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
Alright

2106
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,656
Alright

2107
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,704
Okay doesn't have a mic

2108
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,984
Alright okay

2109
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:26,080
We're having a little bit of fun with drug

2110
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:31,200
Make a note for this because this is outrageous this is Adair special yes

2111
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,016
Now they're saying they're going to arrest you

2112
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,064
And put you in jail for 14 years

2113
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,392
If journalists embarrass the government

2114
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,976
I don't see anything

2115
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,864
Yeah I can go home and feed him first so right

2116
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,448
All right ladies and gentlemen

2117
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:57,056
Never had it

2118
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:59,616
Never had it

2119
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,712
Anything else you want to tell us

2120
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,576
There we go that's what the crowd wants

2121
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:15,744
That's what the crowd wants right

2122
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,608
What are the cameras is now moved over to Alex he is off

2123
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,656
On the side of the stage

2124
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,680
Edison dark

2125
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
Speaking kind of still see him

2126
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,056
And what he's doing is he's moving around and stripping off

2127
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:35,456
Button up shirt and you stripping out of it he's not wearing undershirt

2128
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,784
Dancing around taking his shirt off

2129
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,880
I'm on my way I'm on my way

2130
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,208
Mama

2131
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:57,216
I couldn't ask you if you want to go to dinner at the commercial break

2132
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:59,776
I care I'm not going to get past turtle soup

2133
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,080
Got a little bit last year

2134
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,456
Right there and Alex Jones trip to you so you can only get that on the War Room ladies and gentlemen

2135
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,272
You can only get that on the War Room

2136
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,368
Not even on the Alex Jones Show can you get an Alex Jones striptease

2137
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
Only on the War Room

2138
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,840
I think he said drunkenly sleep in his office for a couple hours

2139
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,144
East

2140
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,192
Sleep in his office for a couple hours

2141
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,776
But it sounded like you said drunken before that but it wasn't like

2142
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:35,872
I'm not sure really make it out

2143
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,920
This is this is

2144
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Just G

2145
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,040
This is that no that's that's

2146
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,064
The behavior of somebody

2147
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Who is

2148
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
Enjoying

2149
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,464
Behavior of someone who's super

2150
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,000
Super concerned

2151
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:57,120
About how a real high-level top scientist has just come out and told you

2152
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:03,264
That everybody who's gotten the vaccine is going to have won six of their immune system and everybody's going to die

2153
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,568
He seems like a guy who's like really

2154
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,616
Engaged in doing the work

2155
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,992
Really he's really taking this seriously and you got to trust him and he's right about everything at

2156
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,016
Is it feel to be Vin

2157
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:21,696
You know what else it's also the sign of a boss who has full confidence

2158
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,000
Translate you are going to get your audience

2159
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,328
That you have a show just as important as his

2160
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,888
That everything you're doing is

01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:36,288
Valuable valuable useful to the company boasts the other way it's the sign of a boss who knows

01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,640
Feel that you would dissociate and think I'm your dad dad

2173
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,712
I am a bad father

2174
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:22,112
How's it feel that I'm on are clearly making fun of something in your personal life put by referring to it as your turtle

2175
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,904
Maybe it's your partner or

2176
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:30,304
Something with your roommate who's Peyton the ask how did how do you like that I'm making fun of your personal life in codon

2177
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,608
Horchow

2178
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,728
You know what's funny about this show on I can take it away at any moment

2179
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:40,032
Hi fire David Knight

2180
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,592
I replaced it with a baby

2181
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:46,176
Just a f*** you just at like

2182
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,016
Try and take your job seriously

2183
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:54,368
Trial time

2184
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:00,256
God that's embarrassing I mean I would want a quit so

2185
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:06,656
Even though I know that I'm unemployable media just that moment of like

2186
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,448
This is completely

2187
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,824
So disrespectful I think if we've seen anything in the way that ex Infowars employee is over

2188
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
I've been treated by the media

2189
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:19,456
You never liked Josh Owens when he came out wrote a piece in New York Times

2190
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,248
I think there is an over willing

2191
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
People to accept

2192
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
The negative behaviors

2193
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,112
The people have been engaged in an hour

2194
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:28,160
When they show some penitents

2195
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,952
And understanding of the damage

2196
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,512
But their behaviors cause

2197
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,584
Is room

2198
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,144
Society to forgive one

2199
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,936
Promontory

2200
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,240
Like if I were to leave now and

2201
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,288
Going to be like look here's the deal

2202
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,360
I think he could actually pull that off

2203
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:51,456
But he couldn't be the third person to pull it off

2204
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:56,576
Deep is closing in terms of people's patients for like Redemptive story

2205
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,880
Yeah I think that there is still room

2206
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
For that someone could probably

2207
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,464
Sneakily get away with that

2208
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,512
Anyway I think that this is

2209
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Atrocious

2210
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,328
