00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,176

00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
Sweetheart f******

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
So over B

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,856
Nowhere in a post literal

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
B podcast.

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
None

00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,632
Do that song no hooks

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
No it's like that but with bait

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,056
Shaquille O'Neal song why would I remember a shack song

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
With that didn't know what no hook

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
It was with the Riza

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
The jizza

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Maybe it is surprisingly competent rapper

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Zoo

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,536
V groove Alex Jones

00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Kickstart

Code Red

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,520
Yes is what we're talking about

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
That will be

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Go to that

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
The surprising results

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
The incident

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
Riptide

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
On the

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
The episodes of The Alex Jones Show on

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
20th and 21st

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
All right of 2017

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
There's a lot of wild stuff

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
The cover

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
There's a lot of forgot to do it

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496
We get started let's give a shout out to our new donor what's going on out there

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Thank you so much for joining up with the team listen up John McCain if you don't f****** get back on board with tending

35
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
Bulshit on repealing Obamacare

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
To give us money

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
To the show become a policy walk yourself

38
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
You can do so by going to knowledge fight., quick

39
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Sports robot

40
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,120
We would appreciate it

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
You just made me think of

42
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
That the terrible way to do that

43
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
When I asked

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
I would have gone with Barry Manilow

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
I swear to God I will do that whole f****** song

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
I don't want you to do that

47
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,072
That's all we're going to do various songs by

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
The point

49
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
Never get a passport

50
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Let's get to the point

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,288
Daughter about we will never actually deal with Alex Jones

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,128
Let's not deal with Alex Jones in this first clip

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Let's deal with p****

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Incredible

55
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,320
P**** in this next clip

56
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
You got a

57
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
The spirit in him starting here on September 20th

58
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
And

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,096
To say whatever

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,264
His browser history

61
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
View that his thoughts on pornography

62
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Dovetail

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Interesting Lee

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Into

65
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,552
Florida

66
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
That's good right

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Previous generation

68
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Logan

69
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
They're watching hardcore p***

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,824
And they are not hanging out with

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Playboy

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
20 guys

73
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,471
You're stupid

74
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,687
Every study shows it up here on some Puritan horse telling you

75
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
That this was all pushed

76
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Legalize

77
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Family

78
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Reproduction

79
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
And the ending enjoyment of sex

80
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Everything

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Need to classify

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
Everything is been Declassified at some point because Alex is just making up

83
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Everything

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Wild

85
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
It's just like

86
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,503
Peanuts that are high in cholesterol

87
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
I got it

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Was created by Ronald Reagan's who destroyed the black

89
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Classify

90
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
It means

91
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Rick Ross got out of prison

92
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
This is so f****** stupid

93
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Right on one level in that in that like I think so

94
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
There are some people who are into those more extreme thing

95
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Both men and women

96
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
And there's nothing wrong with it

97
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Exploring

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
So I mean there is a there is a legitimate

99
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Concern

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
Burning out neural Pathways in your brain

101
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
And stuff like that

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
Hey man whatever you want to do go do it I always suspect

103
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
Especially with this kind of bulshit Merida

104
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
I always suspect that what we're really dealing with

105
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
The older generation

106
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
Completely incapable of dealing with the speed

107
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
But also the speed with which

108
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Culture changes

109
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Yeah from

110
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Something really uptight to something

111
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
More permissive

112
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
Also I think the older generation

113
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Having a

114
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
I wouldn't call it a stiff upper lip

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Kind of mentality but it like

116
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,919
You know back in the day people wouldn't even admit that they masturbated

117
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Women masturbating till like

118
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
20 minutes

119
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
The people do not understand or recognize the history of it

120
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
So ever like you know why you can read

121
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
Because of poor interesting main reason that you can replace China that's why they created work

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,519
Immediately following the Gutenberg Press

123
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,359
There was an underground network of pornography

124
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
That would be like

125
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
For real in the six

126
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
1800

127
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
You would have to

128
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
Get these books that would be Underground Railroad

129
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Unfortunately

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
To use that metaphor

131
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
Also house so many bibles distributor

132
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Difference

133
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Just been around

134
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
I get the people believe that

135
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,359
I think it is

136
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Every technological advancement

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Has almost always

138
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
Do you support nogra

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
I don't disagree with the very powerful motivator

140
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
Would we have if it weren't for what are we talking about

141
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
I'm talking about

142
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
They would draw the

143
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Okie dokie

144
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
I don't know if you meant the Themis wrapped cookie cookie

145
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
I don't know if I have the correct terminology

146
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Take that you're not going to get a correction from

147
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,807
But that was that was the way they advertised it in the way that you drew it was so important

148
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
As well so much

149
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Of Art

150
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Tire existed

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Is built

152
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,327
Okay so I get it everyone everyone everyone listening gets it

153
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
You love p***

154
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
Hey we all have our stuff we all have our stuff

155
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
This is weird about it

156
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Brightside

157
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
That is only the

158
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
First thing you super weird about on the 20th

159
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
He spends a good hour and a half

160
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
After the show or so

161
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
A co-host

162
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
With our old chiropractor friend

163
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
The one doctor group

164
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
He comes on

165
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
He loves it

166
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
He thinks it's very important

167
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
I'm just so done with the b*******

168
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Okay

169
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
Everybody has to have this hot take on

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
Corn or whatever I was just saying that recently I've read about

171
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,183
Bunch of them about p*** and how everybody does all of this

172
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
It always boils Back Down 2

173
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
You don't know anything he definitely haven't learned anything from history

174
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
Was that that's fair but I I think and I don't know what you've been reading necessarily so I don't I don't know if I can respond to any

175
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,407
Whenever I was I think that there is something to be looked at

176
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Be cautious of

177
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Combination

178
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Of pornography

179
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
High speed in

180
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
Because of the ability of Internet

181
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Itself to be habit-forming

182
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
And the compulsive

183
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
And pornography

184
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Also to be compulsive

185
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,631
The mixture of the two in the same way that online gambling is super

186
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Necessarily

187
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
But

188
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
Try and save it

189
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
Let's let's go wild west

190
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Let's let's face it

191
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Do you like oral sex

192
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
F******* probably wouldn't

193
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,023
Lego sets

194
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
One of the big reasons that France all the time was

195
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Because they're whores

196
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
His little little beads his language

197
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,335
Performed French style

198
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
States of America

199
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,479
Pornography who cares

200
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
Train re-litigate the history of sexual acts

201
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
I'm very angry just the first f****** clip a show tonight

202
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
This is so minor

203
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,887
Awareness is not adjusted by anger

204
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
You're going to get so much more.

205
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
Cuz doctor group group is on the show

206
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Because he got

207
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
A package

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
From a whistleblower

209
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
As we know is a chiropractor and holistic medicine

210
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Specialist

211
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Working out of Houston

212
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Danny's working out of the new life Medical Center or whatever

213
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Online bypass

214
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
Clients and customers

215
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
So you got a package

216
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Someone that

217
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Included

218
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
Book that children we're getting in Texas schools

219
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
About mental illness

220
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
And about going to a psychiatrist

221
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
Largely taking some of the stigma and

222
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,903
Fear away from going to a doctor and talking about that

223
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Boy

224
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
They take a very different approach to it

225
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Talk about the

226
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Psychiatric care

227
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
And I'm not going to be happy about whatever

228
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
You're not

229
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
You're not but it's

230
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
It's worth exploring a little bit

231
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Some of the

232
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Bulshit

233
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
And it

234
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,527
You know it's the narrative they want to talk about so we're going to have to talk about it

235
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
Here's the first clip where Alex

236
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Doctor

237
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
I don't even

238
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Call him dr. group

239
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
Add to from now on

240
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Edgar Edward group

241
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
So Alex

242
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Egg group

243
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,239
A group CPA

244
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
Sentient flies

245
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
Andrew I bought my degree

246
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Medication

247
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Is mine

248
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Control

249
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
So

250
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Please resist the urge to

251
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Scream about any

252
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
I know it's going to be.

253
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,071
All of these medications

254
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
Over 780,000 adverse effects have been reported with psychotropic drugs

255
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,823
Put you on multiple other medication

256
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
But they also know that you're going to be in the system

257
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
There is lot there are laws written that if you have mental illness bacon take you or your kid and you have zero right

258
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Anytime

259
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
It also prevents you from having a gun in those cases

260
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Always only

261
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Oh if only

262
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
And make you easily controllable

263
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Read some reports now about electromagnetic frequency

264
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,615
Medications with different

265
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Chemtrails

266
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
And the EMS stuff

267
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
That's Doctor hamamoto crazy elephant

268
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Who's been reading hamamoto that rug really tied the room together

269
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,959
We do it isn't it great like the more we sort of look at these things the more we see like it's all self-reinforcing

270
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,335
Yeah it's all complete lies that are just like OE props up baby props update

271
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,919
And see somewhere in the mix there

272
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,319
Yeah it's actually required even 780,000

273
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Can happen through medication

274
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,951
Bulshit

275
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,583
But he's not taking into account a lot of them are like dry mouth or headache

276
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
And stuff like that

277
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,215
And if you were a real doctor

278
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
He would understand the nature of side effects

279
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
And how it's

280
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Heart

281
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Abusing medicine

282
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Have you learnt

283
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,527
To deal with them or adjust the medication accordingly

284
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm on 6

285
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Lamictal

286
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Which is

287
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Theoretically an okay.

288
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
It causes

289
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,679
Are you are you parroting Ed okay

290
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Further than him

291
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Can't without being

292
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Just

293
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
Get you either

294
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
What are you saying I almost believed that

295
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
No

296
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,695
Hypothetical

297
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Why the f*** would

298
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
That's not how

299
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
That's not her Medicaid

300
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
So in this next

301
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,191
They talk more about that

302
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Control aspects

303
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Yeah those medication

304
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Try and make

305
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Scared of doctors

306
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
.

307
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
With something

308
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Kind of like

309
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Kind of

310
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
The number one cause

311
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
True

312
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
And Jenny who is

313
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,999
The nurse that murders baseball

314
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Kind of jocular but it's actually like

315
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
It's really funny when you know what I

316
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Want to remind you

317
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,615
What do they do

318
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
The next big rollout phases here

319
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
It's chilling Rena playing

320
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
So doctor group

321
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
Before this

322
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
He had heard

323
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
11 call

324
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
How someone calling in

325
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Just killed his chill

326
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
I don't know why you would ever want to listen to that

327
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
Or play it on the show

328
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,007
I turned it off before they ever played it if they did

329
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Because I would never want to hear that

330
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
No I don't

331
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Don't care for

332
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,967
That put them in another

333
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Somnambulism

334
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Situation

335
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Where

336
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Some kind of

337
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
Prescribed sleeping

338
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Pink pill

339
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
I have no idea

340
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
That has happened in the

341
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
The past

342
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Sleeping pills and like

343
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
Wound up somewhere

344
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
Absolutely

345
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Detroit Burger Bar

346
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Is it is a possible

347
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Sing it has happened

348
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
For no one let me tell you this

349
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Ad does not go very heavy on the beach

350
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Explain too much

351
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
WhatsApp

352
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
The situation is

353
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Just for reference with their talk

354
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Totally normal people

355
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Tommy's drug

356
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
I looked at Google 33%

357
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Increased risk of death

358
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Drugs

359
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
And all of these

360
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Statistics that I could find it match

361
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
The 33%

362
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
It was about overdose

363
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
Yeah babe gone up 30

364
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
The opioid crisis

365
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
Percent increase

366
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Andover do

367
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
I also found some

368
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Studies about

369
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Basically antipsychotics

370
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Greatly reduced

371
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Death rates

372
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
And people who are schizophrenic absolutely kept me for

373
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
The times of my life 100%

374
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:53,055
But at the same time every single study because you actually look at it they make very clear

375
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
That in no way could you study

376
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
What would have happened if someone wasn't

377
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
On the drug

378
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
So it is

379
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
Anytime you're trying to site like

380
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
This increases the risk of death

381
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Run treated mental illnesses

382
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Especially ones that have

383
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Schizophrenic tendencies

384
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
Has a very high likelihood of you hurting

385
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Turn yourself off

386
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
Over what be missed by Alex's rhetoric

387
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Everything

388
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
If everything is Alex quotes

389
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
What's the study

390
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
He is lying a

391
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
That is a 100%

392
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
That's the result of our study

393
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Psychotic break

394
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Megalomaniac

395
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
Because

396
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
You go into a subconscious Realm

397
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
In between Consciousness and unconsciousness

398
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
You go into a dream state

399
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:15,743
So just real quick it's a coloring book and it's for children and it's

400
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
You know it's just animals

401
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
It's like

402
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Kimora fires animals

403
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Going to a therapist

404
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
It's nothing it's nothing they make it

405
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
So creepy

406
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
It's so f***** up

407
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
But it's nothing really out of the ordinary that you would see

408
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
Probably at the doctor's office

409
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,527
It makes sense to have

410
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Exposed to the ideas of

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Hey if you feel weird

412
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
There might be help

413
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
That's what it would have been incredibly helpful

414
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Over

415
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
Most of the people I've ever met

416
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Family didn't even

417
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Believe in psychiatry

418
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
It did a lot of

419
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Damaged

420
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
If Only They had read a children

421
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
Help you everything's going to be okay

422
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
Gave Chris some medicine

423
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Which medicine

424
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Everyday

425
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,192
And Chris goes to see a special person to play and talk

426
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,336
Most sexual crimes are actually create done with psychiatrist

427
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
Because of medication

428
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
It is is absolutely

429
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
Trying to find bad people

430
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
So I think

431
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
I think that's one

432
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
He is right

433
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Drug reps

434
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Star

435
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
Alright like a prostitute

436
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,768
Very hot for the manipulative usually

437
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
He was cute doing great and then he was like

438
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
It's not like I'm willing to bet that has happened occasionally but that's not the

439
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
It's the exception not the rule

440
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Who cares

441
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
No

442
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
It shouldn't you don't need

443
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
That part though

444
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Bad enough already that they are

445
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Using that

446
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
To give

447
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
People drugs

448
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Maybe they wouldn't otherwise

449
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Because of the drug

450
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Field for a long

451
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
Yeah tell you right now

452
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
Totally

453
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Most sexual crimes are being done by psychiatrist

454
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
There's an article here in the Atlanta

455
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Journal-Constitution

456
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
More than 100,000

457
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Documents

458
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Some other records

459
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
Across the country to find cases

460
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
They may have been involved

461
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Sexual misconduct

462
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
With doctors

463
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Doctors as a whole

464
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes does include dentist who are creeps

465
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Have they found

466
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
More than

467
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
2400 incident

468
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
Since January 1st 1999

469
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
People who are saying

470
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Action for violations

471
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
The clearly involved

472
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
2400 out of 100,000 is

473
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Small

474
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Percentage of the hundred thousand

475
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
And it's also

476
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
2470

477
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
1999

478
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Credibly small

479
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
Percentage of

480
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Wait

481
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
That's total

482
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
3008

483
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,472
Over that time span a bit I'm sure there are other every there have been other

484
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
They didn't look at every single

485
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
Complaint spittle

486
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Some sense of

487
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,944
Scale there are how many could have gone

488
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Report

489
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Tun tun

490
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
But that's that's going to be fairly difficult

491
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
And let me tell you something

492
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
Far less likely that it was drunk

493
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
Far more likely that it's talks

494
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Probably

495
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
But I really want to peel out of this

496
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Is that

497
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Those numbers

498
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Cannot make up a

499
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
A majority

500
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Sexual assault

501
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Open Chrome

502
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
No doctor group is pulling s*** out of his ass

503
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
Here's how this clip in

504
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
If they just talked about the the

505
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Drug reps having sex

506
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
And I hear your

507
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
Are basically prostitutes

508
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
No because

509
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
Here's why because I don't use real medicine here I'm not a document I can't prescribe

510
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,832
Arabic Alex might have realized you went down the wrong road there like you at Doctor group has no reason

511
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,048
Ora Ora colloidal iodine

512
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
You're talking to some guy wants a drilling operation

513
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
About some

514
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
Looking for Michelle

515
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Next

516
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,616
Composite whenever we need to but it's a little bit there was no way for me

517
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Cut it down at all

518
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
Yes because if this makes

519
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Clip they bring out

520
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
The coloring book

521
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
Alex editorialize is on it

522
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
One of the most inappropriate fashion

523
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
He is capable

524
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
It is gross

525
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,480
For the antipsychotic

526
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
It's incredible

527
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
And it's on the insert

528
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
And it causes psychotic breaks

529
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,696
We've been over this but I just want to reiterate the reason that they have that protect

530
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
A vaccine

531
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Companies

532
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
Is because of people like

533
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,096
It's because of people who caused a

534
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Anti-vaccination

535
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,448
Tympanic

536
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Monster of the week

537
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,824
It is a hundred percent in order to make sure that

538
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
Medical progress continue

539
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Imagine how much

540
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Research would be

541
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,248
Droid how much

542
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
If people listen

543
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Dark

544
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
It would just be played

545
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Everywhere

546
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Lakeview

547
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
All these potential side effects

548
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Text me and you shouldn't take

549
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
Medication that could save your life

550
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Right or save other people's lives

551
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
If you have a psychotic break

552
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Something like that

553
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
There's a Publix

554
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Possibility

555
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
How many people died because

556
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Because they go to a holistic

557
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Medicine

558
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Tucker group

559
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Egg group

560
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
Add group design

561
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,552
Poop

562
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,624
Is

563
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
A direct analog 2

564
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Like if we didn't

565
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
People because of

566
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
Cancel side effects

567
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
You'd have everyone with small

568
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
Humanity would be

569
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
Dead which at this point

570
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:56,544
Bring it at this point yeah maybe maybe vaccines are bad maybe we should have called

571
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Anyway

572
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Let's get to this coloring

573
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
It's on the inserts

574
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
Who's obsessed with the inserts that come with the medication

575
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,952
No no not the insert that you can find

576
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
The thin papered one

577
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
That comes with the vile at the doctor's office

578
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
Basically all the exact same

579
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,728
A prescription has that really long

580
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Paper that

581
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Most people don't ever read

582
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Search

583
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,688
Has all the secret information

584
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
The real iPod the reason I wanted to

585
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Positive

586
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
In preparation

587
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Episodios

588
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Doing a little bit of

589
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
And

590
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
It turns out that adult coloring books

591
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
Are highly recommended

592
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,304
Psychiatrist psychologist

593
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
Apparently

594
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
The people just never really paid

595
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,040
What repeat

596
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
Let's make our knowledge fight coloring

597
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,768
Let's make a knowledge by caulking

598
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
But it makes you feel your family

599
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
Takes away the impulse control

600
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
You start feeling funny colors

601
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
It's wrong balance of medication

602
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
Absolutely

603
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
Everyday

604
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
No one

605
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,328
And the point is you put

606
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Explosive

607
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
Chris are you sad

608
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Chris is sad

609
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
Prince's mom bring Chris to daycare and then goes to work

610
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
Have a good day I'll see you at home

611
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,880
Matt Dillahunty

612
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,440
Daddy

613
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,792
Dr Chris home

614
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
So

615
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
That the thing that Alex is a

616
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Expressing here

617
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Is

618
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
I don't know how exactly I want to phrase this

619
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
He's super into personal responsibility in

620
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
He's not believing

621
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
People are capable of

622
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
Because he's assuming that

623
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
Doesn't feel good

624
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,312
Take him to the therapist

625
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
As opposed to those things being checked off the list

626
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Before you explore that option

627
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
But maybe he needs a Snickers

628
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
Yeah what he's describing is Munchausen by proxy

629
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
Basically

630
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Complete like

631
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Trust in people's ability to live their life

632
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,816
When all he wants is everyone

633
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,144
The way he wants everybody to live their live right so they're doing it

634
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
He doesn't want people to have the

635
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Of going to therapy

636
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,824
Pistor psychiatry

637
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152
Doesn't seem like it matches

638
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Buddy

639
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
That's true

640
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
He's f****** stew

641
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Mommy

642
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
Chris

643
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Call Christopher Ogg

644
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
We got distracted

645
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
Chris was very

646
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Sometime

647
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,288
Wingover is ice cream does he want the drugs

648
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Why Chris

649
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
No

650
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,040
Most of the time is a symptom of

651
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,880
You know

652
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,912
Even the desert

653
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
British had trouble sleeping

654
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
Mommy and daddy

655
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
Chris wasn't playing outside

656
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,664
No

657
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
I can't begin to

658
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Describe how much

659
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Because I remember

660
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
When I was a kid

661
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
I was probably 12 or

662
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
Family didn't believe in

663
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
In any kind of sign

664
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
So

665
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
I had

666
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Complete man

667
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Gotten to

668
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Fight with my pay

669
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
And what wound up happening

670
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
I went back

671
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Scratched out

672
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Like

673
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
And they couldn't deal with

674
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
So I got

675
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,816
Right I remember I have held

676
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
Basically

677
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
For three days

678
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
They couldn't deal with that so I got punished

679
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
What is

680
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,848
What kind of f****** lunatic is like well this just needs

681
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:56,224
To be beaten out of you what the fuc

682
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
What is

683
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Damaged

684
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,112
I didn't even go get help until I was but 432

685
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
You need to go outside

686
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
22

687
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Because of this b*******

688
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
My life

689
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Would have been

690
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Immeasurably better

691
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
Talk about it when I was

692
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,496
The child it's one of the real tragedies

693
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
You're expressing it

694
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
I can definitely relate to him anyways

695
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
When there's stigmatization

696
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Mental health issues

697
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Or in my case

698
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
Almost died novelty ization

699
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Mike

700
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
I don't know how to describe it

701
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Important

702
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
You end up

703
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Wasting

704
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
How much time

705
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,768
And you end up like you said 22

706
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Probably around

707
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
I'm the same age

708
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Became more Siri

709
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Premier League

710
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Took a little

711
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
Realistically when I grew up with a

712
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
But I

713
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
So much loss

714
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
There's so much time there

715
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
People who don't

716
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Struggle with

717
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
They don't

718
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
I'll have

719
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Like they got there

720
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Early

721
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Without

722
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
These negative impulses

723
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Is negative

724
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
Narratives around Mental Health

725
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
You could save a lot of people

726
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Lotto

727
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
There's so much

728
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
So many bridges that I've burned there

729
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
So much that

730
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Could have been

731
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Averted

732
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
Had I not

733
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Ifucking in

734
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
It wasn't your fault

735
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Choice

736
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,968
Choice

737
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
Blame

738
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Parents

739
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
I blame

740
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,136
Religion that they still f****** believe innovation.

741
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Anyways all religion is a lie

742
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,424
It is it is on one

743
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,288
Have your parents fault but on a much bigger and more important version of it

744
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
The ideologies fall

745
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
Propaganda is the ideology

746
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
The same stuff

747
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
He's bordering on Christian

748
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Can scientist

749
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
He's bordering on Sovereign citizen

750
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Schitts

751
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672

And I'm telling you

755
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
It gets worse

756
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472

Get in the back of the white truck it's alright

758
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,528
Josef Mengele

759
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,720

It's written for children sounds dumb

763
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
But in an adult

764
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
Especially

765
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
You're trying to be

Big zits all over his body

775
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Having convulsions last week but now we just put him on extra dress

776
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,080
Mommy likes them and crisco

777
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Special person to play

778
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
Looks like a person out of The Shining

779
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,552
Kris Richard

780
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
Now they've got the death education

781
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
The gadget

782
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
Roblox

783
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Okay

784
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
There was a there was something that came out about the deputy Pope

785
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Not have had some

786
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Involvement

787
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:30,400
I don't care

788
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
Of course

789
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,824
Until proven otherwise they're all on notice they're all suspects

790
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
And I don't know if you'd really

791
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
Characterize

792
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
The Catholic Church

793
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Let's not murder.

794
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,512
Right you're not quite there he's only cool Pope

795
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Because of

796
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
The last one was enough

797
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,912
And all the rest of them have not been much better

798
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
So I bet

799
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Such a load of s***

800
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Alex I know he had nothing

801
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,848
Adductor group comes in with his coloring book and he's like

802
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Yeah let's build

803
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,248
Editorialize on this like crazy I don't want to talk about manafort's

804
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,808
No

805
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
So also give us this

806
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Paul manafort

807
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
Alex's narrative about

808
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Is that

809
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Mueller

810
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
His got to him

811
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
And he's like

812
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Yeah

813
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
But he doesn't have anything

814
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
You better start making

815
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Shut up about Trump

816
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Or else

817
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Diesel you

818
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Torture you until your leg

819
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,688
So Alex is not against that

820
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:52,576
But Alex's version of it is that he is being told he needs to lie about Trump or else

821
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Going to be tortured

822
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
Switch

823
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Very reason

824
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
Very likely

825
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,280
Look with FBI and intelligence agency

826
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
They tortured plenty of people to death

827
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
This we went over this on the episode of Drees that had technical difficulties

828
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
But the point that I made and I stand by it

829
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
Is the Paul manafort would never be torture

830
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
He's a multi-millionaire

831
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
There's no way

832
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Someone like him with

833
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
The connections he has ever going

834
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
Touched

835
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Necessarily

836
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
Play so

837
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Yeah maybe money is an issue

838
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
It is so we have one more clip here from the 20th and it's where I turned it off

839
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
It wasn't like a rage turn off right

840
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Tyga Tyga

841
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,984
This is going to get better

842
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
This is where I checked

843
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
War on corruption and it's Alex Jones Dungy

844
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,808
Infowars 33 per cent increase in death

845
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:01,952
But see that's when you die

846
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
We're going to make money

847
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Sorry

848
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,296
Pizza pedophilia

849
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
Want to give you some drugs

850
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
Easy Pennywise guy

851
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
Alex Jones bad guy with that. The group

852
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,616
Ustad

853
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,431
Arbitrary

854
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:03,135
Anybody anybody

855
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
I want to see how many people John Oliver has helped

856
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,959
I want to see if John Oliver can even get into MIT

857
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
I love

858
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,039
Movie complicated relationship between interrupting

859
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,903
I've been feeling bad about interrupting like I love that vacillation but Alex has

860
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Just like

861
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
I get it we're just going to do

862
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Evax antimatter

863
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Some stuff

864
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
I'll tune in tomorrow

865
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
You guys have fun

866
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
I know it seems like

867
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
I guess I guess it's just that

868
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
As much as much as

869
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Awful as he is all the time

870
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
This just depresses me because

871
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:02,271
Home right you know it's so close to me that I can have a distance

872
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
As much as I

873
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
F****** hate his white nationalist bulshit

874
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
At the same time

875
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
Raging at that in a niche

876
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,839
Intellectual experience I don't have that physical reaction to it

877
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
You might end up buying some internet for him that ends up turning into white

878
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,919
Yeah that's true now there's a possibility

879
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
Experience racism from other race

880
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,575
This is on me that's entirely

881
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
Seems like nothing's like

882
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
Is it because he never got on his meds

883
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
Smack to

884
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
To Mia's

885
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,447
Someone who recognizes on an emotional level that they're mentally ill

886
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
Can't allow themselves to

887
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Understand it

888
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Because of pride

889
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Ego

890
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Particular

891
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
What I hear from Alex is so much of like

892
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
Maybe he went to a doctor when he was a

893
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
Kid or something like that

894
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Take or you wasn't engaged

895
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
With the process

896
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,951
Or maybe at some point in his life maybe not even as a kid

897
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
He's bitter about it still

898
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,047
Hey that they couldn't fix me they can't

899
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
Or something like that

900
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,167
That is also like I've been to three different

901
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Two worksheet

902
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,799
Everyone does

903
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
Information I could have been like well

904
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Psychiatry

905
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
So I'm out

906
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
And I would have gone to Ed group

907
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Susceptible to that to a certain extent

908
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
Like I have my periods where I'm just

909
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Yeah and

910
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
I might be

911
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,071
Being way too empathic and trying to

912
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
Applied Humanity to Alex

913
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
It does not exist

914
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
I need to go fuc

915
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,775
I'm with you but also a human

916
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,335
I'm so whenever they're believing

917
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
Well I genuinely have I stopped believing that

918
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
He lost his Humanity card

919
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,527
A while back for me Immortal flesh-and-blood person

920
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,927
You're an animal fine even if you're in a pin put lead Stout

921
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,767
Experience and output I always try and figure out

922
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Why is this

923
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
The output

924
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
What happened

925
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
What would lead one to this

926
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
And obviously

927
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
With the vaccination

928
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Amstaff

929
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
With almost every narrative he has it

930
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
He's illiterate

931
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
He doesn't know what he's

932
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Misinterpreting things or Hughes

933
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,455
Like allowing propaganda to sway him

934
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
Deliberately

935
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
Right that's entirely possible

936
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Opens up the other

937
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Section

938
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
Of the mystery which is if he's lying

939
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,047
Is he lying what is the motivation because I don't think that somebody necessarily

940
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Just for fun

941
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
Would want to lie about vaccine

942
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:03,263
I mean if you have a lot of money in groups bulshit beans

943
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
Advertised all leather medicine doesn't work

944
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
That's fair that could be

945
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Commercialism

946
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
It could be

947
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,575
We could be and it could be just a broken person who does

948
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Doesn't know how to fix

949
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
And super Bale

950
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Is not helping

951
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Sociopathic monster

952
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,511
So now we go onto the 21st

953
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
Things get a little weird

954
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
21st

955
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
September 2017

956
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
Because Media Matters

957
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Does come out with an article

958
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Expend

959
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Almost

960
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
Tire show

961
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
After Alex Rambles about

962
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,967
Pilgrims to the Stars

963
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279

Authoritarian

967
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Across the globe

968
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,111
So also Alex is really Paul Revere was a s*** there was a woman

969
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Twice as much

970
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
Well

971
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,279
Interesting

972
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:35,167
Is because yesterday cuz he's largely ineffectual and Hillary Clinton

973
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
Interview with her came out

974
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
She was trying to be a Paul Revere

975
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
For issues like cyber

976
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,103
Security

977
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
Furious

978
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Cares

979
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
We are going to reinstitute the free market

980
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Capitalist

981
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Nation state system

982
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
Prosperity

983
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
And the Long March

984
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Superstars

985
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,679
Also know how poorly people live

986
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,031
That all

987
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,407
I don't I don't think so I don't think he understands who web Dubois

988
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,247
I want also want to point out the entire intro

989
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
Until he gets to the part about drug

990
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
He's looking around

991
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Clearly like filling toy

992
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,975
He's like the producer has stepped away from the board or something like that

993
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
I don't know

994
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
What's going on I have no cues

995
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:37,119
I was going to talk about going to the store

996
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
Glorious

997
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Caremark

998
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
To the Stars

999
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,919
Unlocking the secrets of the universe

1000
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
From the future

1001
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
Enemies of freedom

1002
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Western Civilization

1003
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
And Christianity

1004
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Turn control of our

1005
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
Freedom is a Russian agent

1006
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
We couldn't buy Trevor ourselves

1007
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,615
We couldn't vote against

1008
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Is George Soros a Nazi collaborator

1009
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,063
America

1010
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
With Russian propaganda

1011
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:37,023
I guess he infected with the New York Times The Washington Post and seen any links to everything but there it is

1012
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,167
And they track Warehouse

1013
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
Just like

1014
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,455
Links to the media

1015
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,879
So

1016
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
They did

1017
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Is there

1018
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
A lot of billing

1019
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
The course of

1020
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
12

1021
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,447
And they found that there was a

1022
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Jump

1023
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Hindilinks to Russian

1024
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
State-owned media sources

1025
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
In 20s

1026
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
It's a jump

1027
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
From

1028
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
This about 80

1029
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
85

1030
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
2050

1031
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
To 100

1032
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
22

1033
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
In 2016

1034
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
And that's up from about 35-40

1035
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
A 2014

1036
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Those are massive jump

1037
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
They're all state-owned media sources

1038
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
It's not that

1039
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Talks about like the next

1040
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,239
Good news and stuff like that run operation

1041
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,263
Could just be

1042
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
A Mexican news source

1043
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,639
One of the reasons why this is particularly

1044
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,919
But interesting as

1045
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Study

1046
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
The only thing that Alex says

1047
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
There's like

1048
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
He likes to the New York Times

1049
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,927
Which means he hasn't read the article

1050
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
The article isn't just that he licked

1051
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Do all this

1052
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Stop

1053
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
It's more important

1054
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
That they found

1055
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
That he

1056
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Here I'll just read this quote

1057
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,727
Judge is also regularly turn to RT and spotting

1058
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,519

00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,615
Including their denials of Russian election

1061
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151

The US role in Syria and their efforts to undermine NATO member

1063
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,575
And he's frequently highlighted the Russian Outlets favorite conspiracy theories

1064
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Hysterics

1065
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,927
Including their reports on meetings of the mysterious Bilderberg Group

1066
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
Debunked claims

1067
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
Google manipulate its search results to favor

1068
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
And warnings

1069
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Increase Western

1070
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
Support

1071
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,167
George's affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin

1072
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,495
Chinese propaganda Outlets

1073
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
Drug has a rare power is

1074
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
The media GateKeeper

1075
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
Unusual ability to push reporting

1076
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
From previously unknown Outlet

1077
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Do a mass evolve

1078
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
So

1079
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
Since is like all of these

1080
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
To what they're talking about

1081
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
And what it's really about

1082
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
Is not that he made live

1083
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,023
It's that he supported the Russian propaganda narrative

1084
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Various

1085
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
So you had like

1086
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
One really good

1087
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,191
Specifically had near was

1088
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
The Malaysian plane

1089
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,287
They talked about they talk about the

1090
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,079

1092
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
So here we go

1093
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:37,247
On July 17th 2014 Malaysia Airlines flight mh17

1094
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
He was shot down over

1095
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,575
Eastern Ukraine killing 298 passengers

1096
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Cousin crew

1097
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,391
The next day President Barack Obama

1099
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Rushing back

1100
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207

By Russian president propaganda Outlets

1107
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Confusion about the app

1108
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
And they're telling

1109
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
Actually been a failed attempt

1110

The Russian propaganda effort

1112
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687

1113
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
Boost

The thing that so not only is he

1126
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Going up as

1127
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
A huge signal booster

1128
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,663
Like in on the Drudge Report which I do my best never to visit

1129
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
There's always the big giant

1130
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:46,879
And then there's all those tons of little tiny

1131
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,159
It's it's touch

1132
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
It's such

1133
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,463
Bulshit

1134
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,535
Even caricature characterized

1135
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
As

1136
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
He's just a link

1137
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,423
Depends really influence

1138
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
How

1139
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,311
The links links

1140
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079

1141
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Perception

1142
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
As they

1143
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Engaged

1144
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
Cuz idiots only read headline

1145
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,343
But at the same time I completely support his ability to do that I think that is still within free speech

1146
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
I think he's a craven horrible propaganda I don't think be allowed to do

1147
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
Veteran support Isabella

1148
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,119
To do that I I supported in as much as I support things that are just

1149
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,935
It's one awful I just wish that we had a

1150
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,567
A conversation in place that was much more realistic and much

1151
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:42,943
More

1152
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
Think that they are

1153
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Capable of thinking

1154
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
For themselves

1155
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Basically

1156
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,071
Bigger issue is the article is not about

1157
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,607
How many links

1158
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
He put up or any of that

1159
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
It is about the narrative

1160
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,823
It's about how he falls in line with the

1161
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
Trickle-down effect

1162
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,919
Throughout

1163
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Alex Jones

1164
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Breitbart

1165
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
All of them take massive

1166
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Cues from Breitbart

1167
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
Dusky is the

1168
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Purveyor

1169
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
The bottleneck

1170
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,719
We're Russian propaganda

1171
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Ends up getting funnel to mainstay

1172
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,303
Yeah that's what the article is about

1173
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
And it's very

1174
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
It is

1175
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
It is something that

1176
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
People need

1177
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Whether or not it's

1178
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Actually

1179
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Collusion

1180
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:45,151
I'm not saying that

1181
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,991
You have to go far outside of America

1182
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,295
To get your dumbass

1183
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Because they are Pat

1184
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,647
Right

1185
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Have to have to link to art

1186
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:02,559
Because reality disagrees with him and Artie love pedaling up

1187
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
Shiftboard

1188
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,215
Well their version of reality

1189
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,543
Alexander Russia has its own version

1190
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:17,151
Because there is no objective reality we have our own

1191
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,015
Some good I've been thinking about a lot I've been I've been dwelling on foreign policy

1192
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,367
Has become incredibly clear to me

1193
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
How wildly

1194
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Complicated every

1195
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
Like you think about how Russia's Russia

1196
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
China supports North

1197
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,399
Are you think about it most people if they were hard-pressed

1198
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Say why

1199
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,495
Both both communist countries

1200
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,615
My big brother little brother kind of thing

1201
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,455
Could be by their support it keeps North Korea from

1202
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,319
Even crazy well that's one possibility another possibility is that

1203
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,391
North Korea

1204
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Be

1205
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
Like if they were

1206
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
China Wok

1207
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
This is this is one possibility

1208
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,423
China supports North Korea

1209
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
North Korea wants

1210
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,495
Reuna fortified Korea

1211
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,079
Reunified

1212
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
US military presence

1213
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
Good weekend

1214
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Japan

1215
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,991
Status in the Asian

1216
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:29,343
Yeah so there could be an entire thing going on where there's a domino effect

1217
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,415
Of China wanting to weaken Japan

1218
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,999
And get America out of there

1219
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Supporting North Korea

1220
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
What I'm getting at is

1221
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,911
All these things are possible and likely influences on

1222
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
And there's a simplistic version

1223
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Incredibly impossible

1224
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,031
To break down

1225
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Real

1226
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,639
It's like if you go to if you go to work

1227
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Studio and you

1228
00:57:55,455 --> 00:58:01,343
And how huge it is but and having thousands and how it's like oh well this knob changes something

1229
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
And then you have to

1230
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
2nd

1231
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,903
Over there

1232
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
There's so many interlocking

1233
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,767
If you look at my board I've got way more affection I know how to ghost

1234
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
There's all kinds of different things that

1235
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,631
Can be adjusted

1236
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,727
A tiny little bit so it's hard it's hard to

1237
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,519
Find some sort of Harmony there

1238
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Continuing with my metaphor

1239
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
Inexplicably

1240
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Vet

1241
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
With without

1242
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,431
Breaking something

1243
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
Right right

1244
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,271
Pushing too far on one thing is going to

1245
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
Lose control or another

1246
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,623
Adidas

1247
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Nationalism

1248
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:39,743
Stupid that I'm getting at is when you look at like this

1249
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Situation with Russia

1250
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Mike

1251
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,399
1818 saying for anyone to think that they don't want to reunify

1252
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Soviet Union

1253
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
It's absurd tonight

1254
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
It it just

1255
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
Bromley geopolitical 7.8

1256
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
If

1257
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
There is a narrative that involves

1258
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Doing

1259
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Like what's a Annex

1260
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
Part of

1261
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
A farmhouse

1262
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
They stole that

1263
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:14,559
Is Russia an ally has intellectual property to the butterfly surprise

1264
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,191
Explanation of like

1265
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,311
Sympathetic explanation they are trying to

1266
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,639
Encroaching build back up a little bit

1267
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,199
When you have those two possibilities in front of you

1268
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,527
You are incredibly irrational if you don't think the latter is

1269
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Just think about it man

1270
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,135
What's lost the Cold War

1271
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Or

1272
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Something like that

1273
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Like I don't even know

1274
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
Mr.lee how we would have

1275
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Except for nuclear war

1276
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,423
Let's say the entire scenario was completely different and we end up losing

1277
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,519
Alternate reality Cold War where we lose the Western

1278
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,335
Like the entire West Coast

1279
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Is gone

1280
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,175
Over the course of the neck

1281
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,223
Next fifty years or so we

1282
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Become

1283
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,063
Slightly more part of the global

1284
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:13,695
Community but at the same time we're a bit of a hostile actor

1285
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
I like mine

1286
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
Hannah we keep taking a little bit of Montana

1287
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:22,911
Like why would anyone think that we would want to reunify the United States

1288
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
Every single country

1289
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
Every single country that

1290
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Like is a

1291
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,639
Power that is split ends up wanting to reunify

1292
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,687
What's the equipment

1293
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,783
Because of the narrative because of the narrative

1294
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
That has arisen about

1295
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,415
F****** the dumbest f***

1296
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
Reagan

1297
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
Solving the Cold War

1298
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,815
Yeah people forget is the main reason that we

1299
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
We won the Cold War

1300
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,887
Is cooperation

1301
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
Bright

1302
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
Did not do that

1303
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
Because they were obsessed

1304
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
With nationalism

1305
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,591
It was a Triumph of global Co-op

1306
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
Global cooperation

1307
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
Over Nashville

1308
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,711
Elizabeth

1309
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
Has become

1310
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:15,391
It was a Triumph of nationalism right for another it was Reagan making a harsh demands

1311
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,951
Absolutely

1312
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
The only way you're ever going to solve those

1313
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
So what's the problem

1314
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
And any of these

1315
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,631
Incredibly complicated foreign-policy problem

1316
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,423
Is pretty much

1317
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Getting

1318
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Large

1319
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Coalition

1320
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,263
Things together to work

1321
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
Concert

1322
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,639
What are the main reasons that we have the allies

1323
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
Is because of our

1324
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
Support for the

1325
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Another attack

1326
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,295
Without our support following

1327
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
World War II

1328
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,879
Germany would absolutely be a

1329
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Shell

1330
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,207
Germany

1331
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
The Soviet Union

1332
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
The same with Japan

1333
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,559
Like the way that we won those

1334
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
Was

1335
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
Are the way that we won those words

1336
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Beyond

1337
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
The end of the

1338
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,543
Was we learned the lesson from

1339
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
World War

1340
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
The Treaty of the site was so cute

1341
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,919
German

1342
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
Of course they were going to start another

1343
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
And of course

1344
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,159
Because all of the people who learned that lesson

1345
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,719
We have to learn it all over it

1346
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:29,119
Just like you and I were talking about we are likely to see another new another new

1347
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,935
Because people don't remember

1348
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,959
How monsters

1349
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,031
But it seems like the likelihood

1350
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,103
I don't want to feed into that and

1351
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
You know cuz I think that a lot of people

1352
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
We hear that

1353
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,735
Get scared or take it the wrong way

1354
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,599
I think they will probably as close as we've ever been in our lifetime

1355
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
Who knows

1356
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,951
But I still think that a lot of

1357
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
A lot of it has

1358
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Facility pasta

1359
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:02,655
Chaotic actors there is the possibility that posturing

1360
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Leeds

1361
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
EXO

1362
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
Just died

1363
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
And we didn't find out about it until last week or we talked about the guy from the Soviet Union.

1364
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,759
Who stopped

1365
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
He

1366
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,367
You got an alert that American Rockets were coming in

1367
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Suspected it was

1368
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
False alarm

1369
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
And because of that

1370
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,655
They would have launched at least four examples of that

1371
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
We'll just going like

1372
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
Maybe this isn't real

1373
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
And if you're North

1374
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Korea

1375
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,567
The likelihood of that

1376
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
With an a

1377
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Hayirli brainwashed

1378
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
Civilization

1379
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,687
Seems far less everyone is

1380
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Is brought up to

1381
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Expect that

1382
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Be there in

1383
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Let's get through this

1384
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
Cuz you got to show tonight

1385
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Conversation about foreign policy

1386
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Let's get in

1387
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,583
To this next clip where Alex talks a little bit about

1388
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Usually does

1389
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
Yeah man has an interesting

1390
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
Theory about a

1391
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,847
Fairly recently dead prominent

1392
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,247
Use the word sovereign

1393
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
As a racist dog whistle

1394
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,599
They said it was over

1395
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
Pre-market

1396
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,023
Capitalism

1397
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
I don't think

1398
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
I mean

1399
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,079
There was there was a lot of Flowery rhetoric in it and whoever wrote it did a

1400
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Diesel job except for it

1401
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
Thirty-odd

1402
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,711
Pictures of sovereignty

1403
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Not a friendly loving

1404
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,599
Which one you're like we might have to completely destroy your country

1405
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
Good

1406
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Threatened

1407
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
To demolish

1408
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
A country

1409
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
Civilian

1410
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:12,191
On on f****** real it's like the stuff about sovereignty that you can support you really have to wait

1411
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,471
That against the other stuff

1412
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
Can you use of sovereignty

1413
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,431
All of this

1414
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,551
It all the code words

1415
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Doesn't

1416
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Pre-market

1417
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,311
You don't know

1418
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
Pizza Factory

1419
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
Hippie

1420
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
Threatening

1421
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:06,207
When behind-the-scenes their psycho

1422
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
He's saying that they hit him with

1423
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
Weaponized

1424
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,503
Cancer and took him out

1425
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,743
Once you allow any kind of death to be murdered

1426
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,303
Cancer because he was taking what might as well have been

1427
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
Egg groups

1428
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,911
It might have been

1429
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Oh yeah

1430
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:55,103
Super male Vitality does not cure cancer is the lesson of Steve

1431
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
But I don't I don't think

1432
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Steve Jobs

1433
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831
Should have iPads

1434
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,487
Very opposite of that I do recall I haven't really looked at

1435
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
Into the studio

1436
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
Alex is old version of it

1437
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,607
Was it Steve Jobs dead

1438
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Kids kids

1439
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,471
Want them to have it at a young age

1440
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:28,127
For whatever reason

1441
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,919
Said they were bad and that's why they killed him

1442
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Benz E-class

1443
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,855
Bulshit has more thoughts about the Russia

1444
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
Speech

1445
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927

Trump's bad

1452
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
And what is their sovereign

1453
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
And their question

1454
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,671
Penny pulled away from the clutches of the globalist

1455
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,791
Bolshevik party

1456
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:22,143

Infowar against America

1462
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,119
It just means he was talking about

1463
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,575

Free summer of Rage sale

That's a wild bull

1475
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,231
But also that he's still peddling that narrative

1476
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,511
That Russia is great

1477
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,815

Fuckingawesome

1483
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,943
He's actually be more likely to say

1484
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
Like if you didn't

1485
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,575
Have to if you want to know

1486
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,415
If it was like

1487
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:59,071
Look at how look at how many articles look at how great

1488
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
The Drudge linked

1489
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,679
These article I would also argue that is Alex

1490
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
In his heart of hearts

1491
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239

Yeah your self

1496
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:20,319
He knows that something is pretty f***** up

1497
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,855
Until we get to the

1498
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
I don't care

1499
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,279
My information

1500
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
Russia get some information from me

1501
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,983
Upholstery shop

1502
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:46,687
How did it go

1503
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
What's up

1504
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,319
Like if they already know everything he says

1505
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,647
Spray from here

1506
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:02,047
This is

1507
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,583
End of the military love me

1508
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:07,679
They tune in cuz they already know the stuff I say and I'm the only person who said it

1509
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:14,079
So they can hear me repeat what's true

1510
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,919
But Alex doesn't have the news

1511
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,015
D-does pro-russian narratives

1512
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
People

1513
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,063
Russia would like

1514
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,135
But this is an important distinction that we need to make

1515
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671
Because whenever we talk about Russia

1516
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Just stop

1517
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,231
We always try and be careful

1518
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
You know Express babe

1519
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
The Russian people are great and they're fine

1520
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,887
If the people in charge who are

1521
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,655
Homophobic

1522
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,359
Proportion of the Russian people are just good people trying to get by

1523
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
Suppressor

1524
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,343
Even the ones were brainwashed we feel liniment to pity for people

1525
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:03,487
Talking about Russia is talking about the oligarchy government

1526
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
The Russia

1527
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
And that is f***** up

1528
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
Here's the rest of

1529
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
I'm going to screw it back up

1530
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
Are there we go

1531
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,471
They just already know what I'm saying is true

1532
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
Causes basically

1533
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Affirmation

1534
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,791
You kept exploded

1535
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,631
Why does your associate lose weight

1536
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
So that

1537
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
White nationalist organization

1538
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:53,151
We got our whole group of weirdos involved with them yeah

1539
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,503
But the other thing that I experience there is

1540
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,783
These success

1541
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
Influence

1542
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
These people

1543
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,671
Like Alexander Dugan

1544
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,463
And whoever Alex's talk to behind this

1545
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,255
Pivot Point

1546
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Flattery

1547
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,095
In order to make him think that he is super important and he's

1548
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
Change

1549
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
Yeah he's just spitting back things

1550
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,959
They are using

1551
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
To manipulate him

1552
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,263
Into being

1553
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,567
Super accommodating of their narrative

1554
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,151
And maybe drudge said the same thing happened to him

1555
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
It's impossible

1556
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,479
It's possible that behind the scenes

1557
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
That might happen there too

1558
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,087
Yeah

1559
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
Part is

1560
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
Especially when we're talking about any

1561
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
Collusion

1562
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,279
It may just be the interest don't dump

1563
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,631
I want the Americana.

1564
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
But

1565
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Russia

1566
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Right

1567
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
What's National

1568
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,287
Bright

1569
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
So ideologically

1570
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:57,407
Despite the fact that Russia is a hostel

1571
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:04,063
Ideologically they line up Alex Jones and drudge don't understand

1572
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,367
Is that they are also hostile actors

1573
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
There McDonald's specials

1574
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
Way worse

1575
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:16,351
Because they think that they're making it better

1576
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
Stupid and their Hustle actors towards

1577
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,727
A Cooperative global

1578
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
Leucine

1579
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
Bike

1580
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
Genuinely they just

1581
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,639
Right

1582
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
Quite literally

1583
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,223
188

1584
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,527
Explicit piece of the nationalism

1585
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
They would speak

1586
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,343
For the rest of the world

1587
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,159
Would be Russia take back the Soviet Union

1588
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
Obviously not.

1589
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
If you get a mouse a cookie

1590
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:53,727
Big laska no probably going to Canada looks pretty cool

1591
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
I may be a Russian Canada

1592
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Hilarious

1593
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
To be wild very polite

1594
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,175
Understand that I'm

1595
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,015
Speaking in like a wild hypothetical and

1596
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Canada back

1597
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
We're so sorry

1598
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
A taken Monte

1599
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Tenerife

1600
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
Irish

1601
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,511
A little bit

1602
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Trouble Baez

1603
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
I have solidarity

1604
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
That's weird

1605
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
Alex gets onto another narrative

1606
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Cuz he wants to make a little bit of

1607
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,615
From Oliver

1608
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,991
Play again

1609
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
Letting

1610
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,391
He's not mad about the

1611
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,487
He doesn't play a clip of the stuff about the senator

1612
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Jimmy Kimmel

1613
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
He plays a clip of Jimmy

1614
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,607
Getting mad at a Fox News person

1615
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,143
For critiquing him

1616
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
Bringing his child into

1617
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Discourse

1618
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
Step

1619
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,335
Hillary's

1620
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,919
The reason I'm talking about this

1621
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,951
Crepe

1622
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
Losing his kid

1623
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,607
Casella program

1624
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,679
Brian Kilmeade is a phony Little Creek

1625
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,519
So two things

1626
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
1 oz of butter

1627
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
Responsible

1628
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Alex's song

1629
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Has done

1630
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,039
Infowars.com

1631
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:49,183
His his narrative out there his other children

1632
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
At the time

1633
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,023
Have appeared in a gorilla suit in a sketch mocking

1634
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,047
Trans people

1635
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,655
On the Alex Jones Show

1636
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
You're full of s***

1637
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
Don't bring your kids into

1638
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
F*** you

1639
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,335
Now do you think

1640
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
You can take that clip

1641
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,711
About Brian Kilmeade

1642
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,759
And I

1643
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
Turn it to

1644
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Be about him

1645
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,623
I think so

1646
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,415
Ivan

1647
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
I've been in major Hollywood film

1648
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
Everything

1649
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,391
So easy goes into a long random drunk late

1650
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,719
My phone calls

1651
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,279
Check caller ID probably coming from Trump

1652
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:02,655
Room at Mar-A-Lago

1653
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:11,359
The other thing now is that from there into a long rant about how like

1654
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,175
What I want to be is the image of John Wayne

1655
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:20,319
I want to watch Battlestar in these westerns and spy thrillers

1656
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Starring role

1657
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,159
I don't want to do that what I like to do is I like

1658
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
2 goliyan

1659
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Bee Movie

1660
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
Intex it

1661
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
It's fun for me

1662
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,631
The only things on his f****** resume are the two linklater movies in amerigeddon so

1663
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,959
I don't know what he's talking about if you wants to call amerigeddon Tubi movie

1664
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Agree

1665
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
I would not call

1666
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,823
Abbey movie has Bruce Campbell

1667
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,895
Fair enough has Alex Jones

1668
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Or

1669
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Not at Movie House hours

1670
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,367
For quite a while so cut up

1671
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Haha and we get to this

1672
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,975
Why are you still talking about turning down offers

1673
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,279
How to get really f****** creepy

1674
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
No complaints that you have but Jimmy using

1675
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Kids

1676
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
I think they should be outweighed by how bad this is

1677
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Frog

1678
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
Your grandpa with a brain tumor

1679
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,368
Your failure

1680
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
You're a black

1681
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,768
At this point

1682
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
Kind of like that like

1683
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,448
Either outraged or he's orgasmic it what he's about to say

1684
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,240
And I think it's the latter

1685
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Want to hear what he's about

1686
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,544
You will fall

1687
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,760
Did you

1688
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,344
Tap water

1689
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,648
Why don't you find out why this is happening

1690
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
Socialism

1691
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:09,376
Global control

1692
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
Veronica

1693
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,312
Yeah that's

1694
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
You're the dumbest

1695
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,872
Person in the world

1696
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
He doesn't

1697
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,968
If you don't understand logic

1698
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,504
He doesn't understand that like

1699
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,832
Which I was complaining about I am now doing the worst

1700
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
Version of

1701
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
It's crazy it's okay

1702
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,952
Yeah I'm using your kid

1703
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
To fight against

1704
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,768
Compassion

1705
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,048
Right cuz I hate

1706
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
And to pitch my

1707
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
Wild

1708
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Wild

1709
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
I think I also threatened

1710
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Violence

1711
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,872
You're not mad that Jimmy was threatening

1712
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:00,576
It's when our old friend Larry next song

1713
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
He

1714
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:07,232
Shows up on the show and it's just a repeat of he's already said it's really boring interview

1715
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
Until we get

1716
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
And Larry Nichols said something on the air

1717
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,400
That I think is illegal

1718
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,704
I think this is illegal

1719
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
I'm not sure I'm not a lawyer

1720
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,544
But I'm pretty sure

1721
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
This is at very least

1722
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
A threat

1723
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:27,456
And we can discuss it on the other end but

1724
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,248
I'm not comfortable with this being legal

1725
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Okay

1726
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,856
They are all locked

1727
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,392
Republicans in Congress

1728
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:54,080
Information

1729
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:10,464
Christian

1730
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,016
Received

1731
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,392
National

1732
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:15,232
Nobody

1733
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,768
So we'll get back

1734
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
He's not dumb

1735
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,376
Greatwood great would be if Larry Nichols

1736
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:24,192
Wind-up taking down the Republican Party

1737
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,592
F****** hilarious would that be

1738
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,688
The legal definition of blackmail

1739
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,760
Is an act of criminal involving unjustified

1740
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,832
Threats to make a gain most commonly money or property

1741
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,856
Or cause a loss

1742
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
To another

1743
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
Unless Adam and

1744
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,208
That's literally blackmail

1745
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:52,096
Literally is trying to Blackmail Congress

1746
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:02,336
I think he should suffer some consequences for this even though it's idle threat

1747
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:08,736
Kill people for Bill and Hillary

1748
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
Radio show

1749
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:15,904
About everything

1750
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:20,000
Cuz he was f****** involved in the Iran-Contra and got caught making long distance

1751
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,816
Call Tim Nicaragua

1752
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,960
You repackage

1753
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Cancer having

1754
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,312
Manipulative a******

1755
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Great

1756
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,944
Turn your attention towards the Republicans

1757
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,760
God bless you

1758
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,624
Charade where I don't really care

1759
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,696
You're going after these people that like

1760
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
Okay you bring down Paul Ryan

1761
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
I mean you're not going to but trying to bring out Paul Ryan

1762
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,096
Too funny

1763
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,888
Please

1764
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,704
So hold on good the rest of the Clippers going to play out Alex's

1765
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,008
Scream bathroom stuff and Larry's going to make another

1766
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,064
800

1767
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
20 letters

1768
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:47,040
Hammer Hammer election

1769
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,904
Just like a jury can become a judge or whatever

1770
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,168
Wait you're making weird faces I want to

1771
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,544
Is it a Larry Nichols hotline

1772
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:12,896
What is it if you or someone in your house

1773
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,176
Is suffering from some

1774
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
Press 1 for yes

1775
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,624
I'm going to guess I was in a different acronyms number is 1 800

1776
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
2455 26

1777
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
55-27

1778
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
9

1779
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:35,424
6866

1780
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,824
And see exactly what just happened on 900 Mix-a-Lot

1781
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,736
Obviously

1782
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:15,872
He just threat he was blackmailed Mueller

1783
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:22,272
That might constitute obstruction of justice

1784
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
I mean I know.

1785
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
You have some sort of

1786
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,096
Mysterious information if you don't do what I say I'm going to release

1787
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,824
I mean in all honesty

1788
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,640
If you didn't have to go to your show

1789
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:53,504
You should call him

1790
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,296
I love that like

1791
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,320
Larry Nichols

1792
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,856
For all his faults

1793
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,904
Is a f****** Showman

1794
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
Gino's

1795
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
We're having a boy

1796
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,536
I got to do something

1797
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:12,704
What are legitimately feel like we should send that to the FBI

1798
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:19,360
We're going to call Larry Nichols and we're going to ask

1799
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,152
Weather and I have

1800
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:25,760
Actual

1801
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Wouldn't do what I say

1802
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,136
I kind of want to I kind of want to call him

1803
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
Maybe I kind of want to do it anyways

1804
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,000
We tell him he's on the air

1805
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,448
What the f***

1806
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,312
The special prosecutor

1807
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,384
Yeah probably

1808
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,248
Cliffhanger promised Cliffhanger see what happens with that over the weekend

1809
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:01,344
But also after that I told you this before the show

1810
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
Giovanni you like

1811
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,720
I don't want to have to do it

1812
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
But we're going to burn some

1813
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
Stillgoode

1814
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,912
So good such a great development in the Larry Nichols art

1815
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,728
Absolutely I hope he doesn't die before the end of the season

1816
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:26,432
I want the season to play out you don't have to be a thing where like the show gets canceled mid-season

1817
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,272
Although you know what

1818
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,552
They're going to drop

1819
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
Of course

1820
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,792
Buckley is probably going to talk to Alex

1821
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
Be like

1822
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Dude

1823
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,632
I talked to her lawyer

1824
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
And they said don't do that

1825
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,984
You have to say politically when you threatened

1826
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,800
You can't have Larry Nichols committed crimes on Bonaire

1827
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,592
I know you didn't say it

1828
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,992
They have no problem with it is there just like

1829
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:07,392
Oh yeah let's Nichols Alex

1830
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:13,792
I think it's a good idea to make the same pledge

1831
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,608
I think because you're broadcast

1832
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
A crime

1833
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,448
I think that she may have some cup ability right

1834
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,472
Complicit

1835
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896
So anyway I'll research the legal standard of getting someone in trouble

1836
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
I figure that out

1837
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
You can check us out

1838
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,344

You can also follow us on Twitter that knowledge

1843
01:31:54,752 --> 01:32:00,896
Underscore

1844
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,968
Nothing right

1845
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
With the livestream

1846
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,040
GameStop we will be getting back to that

1847
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
My internet

1848
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,344
Is so crappy because

1849
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,392
Because the router is all the way across the house

1850
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,184
Yeah the range extender sucks

1851
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,232
I'm trying to find the chords

1852
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,512
To fix everything else

1853
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Consistent

1854
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
Product

1855
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,120
I don't want to be putting this half-assed out there right now

1856
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,704
Like the other night we recorded one in the internet went out halfway through and

1857
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,240
Complete disaster

1858
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
So deflating

1859
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,056
Do you know what that was

1860
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
That was the spiritual equivalent

1861
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:40,320
Also by the way John Rappaport was on on Thursday on the 21st

1862
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
That weirdo

1863
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,672
He made this really f****** stupid claim

1864
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,720
How many

1865
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
I can't even do it

1866
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Toothless voice

1867
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,096
How many prescriptions do you think doctors

1868
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Prescribed

1869
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
A year

1870
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
If United

1871
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
20

1872
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:01,568
Hello that's hello it's about 4 billion according

1873
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
To John Rappaport

1874
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
And what

1875
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,200
Is that's not surprising

1876
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,480
At all

1877
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,272
Yeah now that's on

1878
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:13,856
When I have that cyst in my jaw area

1879
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,136
I ended up getting

1880
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,440
Five prescriptions for that maybe

1881
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:23,072
Yeah it would be good at with anyone who's pregnant multiple prescriptions real source of vitamin

1882
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:28,448
All sorts of prenatal postnatal care

1883
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:31,776
Anytime anyone gets strep throat mono any of those things

1884
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
Multiple prescription anytime someone gets

1885
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,712
Hurt or undergo surgery they get painkiller prescription

1886
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,504
I need it so f******

1887
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,320
4 billion prescriptions

1888
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
Makes total sense

1889
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:51,744
What would you like to say to you and your misuse of statistics

1890
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,512
Dumb

1891
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,072
Muppet looking piece of s***.

1892
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
Alex

1893
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,008
First in color
