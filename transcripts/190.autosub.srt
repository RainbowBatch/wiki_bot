1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,360
Beverages and talk about Alex Jones

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,968
Oh no it's a big day for you

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Oh

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,672
Virgo

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,376
Village was way better than I expected

7
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
Beer in the United States

8
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,408
This is one of those nice Facebook murdered

9
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,528
This is one of those

10
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,392
Senses where it would be impossible for you to not know

11
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Nearly every we got

12
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
You maybe

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
I imagine Mike Mike Adams new video 3

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,832
Streaming service

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
What are the Scorpions doing the show is

16
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Or Monday episode

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,352
And you know it was from a 2009 episode that Alex

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
We put it out I feel

19
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
I feel good about life and I wake up Monday morning

20
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
Just everything all over the places

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
Alex's band from

22
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,176
Spotify Pinterest kicked him out yeah it's so like

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,064
Everyone's going to probably be searching for Alex Jones by accidentally find us

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
We have a new episode out today and it has nothing to do with that

25
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
Hazel's like

26
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
I got to try and put out an episode

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Come out

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
To come out on Tuesday

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
On top of it

30
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,752
We can get it at our regular schedule no need for an

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
We people

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
Yeah

33
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Because he's been kicked off even more things

34
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
But even just

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Before we started recording today

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
What you were kicked off y******

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,600
Earlier

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
Just a little bit ago you got

39
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Kicked off milky

40
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
MailChimp

41
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
Cuz it was it sounded a little bit sound like

42
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
MailChimp trying to get some points

43
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
Generally doesn't comment on individual user accounts

44
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
Exception today

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
MailChimp notified Infowars in their account

46
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
I have been terminated for violating our terms of service

47
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
Make it clear that we do not allow people to use our

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
To disseminate

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
But the ship

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
We did that

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Touch of that

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
I mean none of these places really have much of a leg to stand on

53
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Tolerate him for as long as they have

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
I know this whole thing is Magic

55
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
I think we're on the same page that is like

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,792
Sarcastic along time ago you doing it now only

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
I mean it's going to actually hurt him

58
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,448
I don't think so I think he has

59
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Couple other moves

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
Okay I'll text you this part

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Just to finish the thought

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,712
The reason that all of this is happening is because one of these businesses whoever

63
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Flinched first

64
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,088
And just decided fukkit he's gone the rest of them could use that as cover

65
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,720
And they're like we wanted to do this let's just go

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Look at the plan or anything like that but I

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
One of that

68
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
Companies got off their ass

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
And the other people.

70
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Like once I was okay everybody like

71
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Be the first one to be like today

72
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,903
List of users you know

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
The Facebook

74
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Community Wiki

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
You guys there

76
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,655
Chick hours it's ridiculous

77
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Alex's Tire James Gunn

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
Is that what you think that my immediate feeling

79
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,455
On Monday was look into this another bulshit thing where

80
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Expires

81
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
Like videos were ticked off or yeah yeah

82
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Severe

83
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
Response was I had to sit with us for a little while

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
I think the Alex's fate is now in his own

85
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
More than it has ever been

86
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Okay because

87
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Where he goes

88
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
Success or failure is entirely dependent on how he responds

89
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
If he responds with well-reasoned argument

90
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Passion

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Maybe trying

92
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
He could turn himself into some sort of like

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Deceased

94
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
Bruce

95
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,231
He has the opportunity to do that

96
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
She is about

97
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
Actually give him an opportunity to put on the back burner

98
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
That's true but alternatively if he

99
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
He's doing exactly what he

100
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,311
He's doing without the social media platform

101
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:12,991
He's in serious trouble because without Facebook even though he has 11 pages and they only got rid of four of them

102
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
Guys Without

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Being in the iTunes Store

104
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Although and Alex already subscribe to him

105
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
You can still get it if you have an RSS feed

106
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Beacon plugin

107
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
It's just not

108
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
Searchable

109
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
You can't search for Alex in their catalog

110
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
So that's even sort of

111
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
It's going to hurt him

112
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
He's awesome

113
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
YouTube in terms of

114
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
His 2 million

115
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
But that doesn't mean you can't

116
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
F*** with the rules

117
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
And put like I found this episode

118
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
On YouTube

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Yeah

120
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Little weight but it's going to be severely diminish

121
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
And now with MailChimp saying

122
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
They're not going to work with him that's probably

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
It's only a matter of time before

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
I don't I don't know how he runs his website that he's stupid enough to have hosting not be on his own servers

125
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Infowars.com

126
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
I think it's super unlikely

127
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Play fight

128
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
He'll have to

129
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Find a way to

130
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Be his own marketing

131
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
More than he has been in

132
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
And I don't think he's very good at that

133
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
I think he's very alienating to new people

134
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
I think he's horrible

135
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
His own hand

136
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
If you can pull off

137
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Some sort of amazing

138
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Triple axel

139
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
But otherwise

140
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Be he goes back to

141
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
About the

142
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,223
Market penetration in the relative popularity of likes

143
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:54,879
Of whatever somebody with 30 radio

144
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999
No I mean

145
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
I don't know it's sort of

146
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
I doubt it

147
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
888

148
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Time will tell if Alex

149
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Goes along with

150
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,383
I think

151
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
We will see

152
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
This is real bad for him

153
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
But it's not like a knockout blow I don't think

154
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
He's going to have to really fight

155
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
To get out from under there

156
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
Especially when he's already having to deal with being sued

157
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
A bunch of other places

158
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
And his ex-wife is

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
In court with him but the custody stuff

160
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
I think he is

161
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
I think he's going to be hard-pressed

162
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
To fight the way he needs

163
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
To fight in order to save the operation

164
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Are you there are you fighting on all fronts

165
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,407
Actually right now reminds me of the Alamo

166
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
In Tavares

167
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,063
This is entirely his fault I've been in this situation to begin with

168
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
He's going to be overrun and kill

169
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
Angie's the Bronx

170
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
August 28th

171
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
Generally this be the part of the show where I say thank you to a donor but

172
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
We have got the piece of mail the first piece of mail from

173
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Before we open it up

174
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
I would like to say

175
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Before this very generous gift

176
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
The Clarion

177
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
A raptor princess

178
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
Someone sodomites

179
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Caribbean black

180
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
I don't want

181
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
How to read

182
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Control

183
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
I bet you money

184

Abused

Welcome to McDonalds may I help you

187
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,895
Thank you so much

Jordan this is going to blow your mind

189

Oh yeah

191
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
It's only

192
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
Three fingers

193
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Somebody's foot images

194
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
I really imagined to be much heavier than expose holding the package

195
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
The man look at that

196
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Isn't it something else

197
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,039
Very much something else

198
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
I feel like what we should do

199
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Because this is a very bizarre thing

200
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
Is I don't know I don't know we do with the foot

201
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
But I would say with the hand

202
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
We leave it in the middle of the table

203
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
If you have a point and the other person needs to shut up directions to prospect

204
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
Are you going to come this is an emergency

205
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,503
Much better than I expected

206
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
Irrelevant

207
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
This is actually

208
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Because the pinky is

209
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
So we have three fingers

210
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
4 wishes

211
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,919
Tragically fulfilled

212
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,295
If one of our wishes was we got Alex kicked off of Facebook and everything else

213
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
Then the way that would happen

214
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
We also lost our heart

215
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
It gets kicked off

216
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
Because he's created an even better Facebook that would be a monkey pop

217
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,959
Tragic

218
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
It's come to my attention that

219
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
30 New York Knicks

220
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Might not actually work

221
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
1530 Neola

222
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,487
We have received only had as lost

223
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,815
Is pinky finger still too now has our phone number lost

224
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
And we only have one

225
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
We have received some calls

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
Have you listen listen to all of them

227
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
I'd like to be a surprise but I thought

228
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
I'm going on

229
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Call

And work

242
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
We don't care

243
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,951
Call started I thought like

244
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Well maybe this isn't the fan

245
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:58,399
Phone number we still like they accidentally

246
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,263
Either that or I was like this is somebody from like the Civic Department

247
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Hey guys I think you're f****** around and we do not condone your behavior you have

248
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455

Also we are now huge

250
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
You don't believe that

251
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Chico

252
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Fair enough

253
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,975
Bear

254
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,351
I don't know if I can handle the airfare for that

255
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
In the future

256
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
We love to do it but

257
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Arabic

258
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Rent a Winnebago

259
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
Jesus is a lot of fun call

260
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
This is fantastic what a life I've never been happier in my entire goddamn life because Alex Facebook

261
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
No monkey paw there my friend so we've given a little bit of like our preliminary feelings about to Alex

262
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Getting kicked off of

263
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
Reviews of these platforms

264
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
And that is what we're going to discuss

265
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Well I have found the August

266
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
So when he was freaking out about

267
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
The Facebook is all that stuff and come out

268
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,863
I have YouTube all that it happened right before he got on air

269
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
A couple hours to get

270
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Used to the idea

271
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Azar all of this

272
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Contact drop

273
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
From August 6th

274
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,151
Sociopath

275
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Alright

276
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
That's good to hear

277
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
He's not mad

278
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
I'm sure they will be borne out through the rest of

279
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,767
Yeah we'll see when he gets into the big news which of course is about him

280
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
Said it was terminated

281
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
Spotify

282
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Sometime last night

283
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
BuzzFeed

284
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,607
Freddy's playing games

285
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
Because this is

286
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Country

287
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
How do you engrave the First Amendment

288
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Do you go with a ground war

289
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
I wouldn't

290
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
Are you sure so you would start with what like a drone strike campaign

291
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Nougat start from nukes

292
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Absolutely

293
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
I didn't human it can't be killed by Conventional Weapons

294
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
You have to use radiation if you want to kill the First Amendment

295
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
I read that somewhere alright

296
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,391
Emps will deliver temporary

297
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
Alright

298
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Cool

299
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
Alex be kind of heard this talk before

300
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Repeating his narrative

301
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
What he was afraid of happening as happen

302
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
So the idea that

303
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Country

304
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
I am sad country

305
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
Spotless

306
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
Absolutely

307
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
I mean that's not all that excited

308
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
He has to be Petty while he's doing it I guarantee I guarantee that conversation with the other way around

309
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,815
No don't worry about it they don't have the courage to do

310
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,423
Dude we are going to get banned his lawyer is probably telling him

311
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
Hey dude you can't pay me anymore if they kick you off their platform

312
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,151
Alex's

313
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Abnormal behaviors

314
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
But

315
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Interesting

316
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Half

317
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Through a lot of this episode

318
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
He blamed the Chinese

319
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
He'll sort of two angles on his getting kicked off everything and the first is the most aggressive of them

320
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
He blames China

321
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
You asked why why would you blame China

322
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Sure

323
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,063
What

324
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Chinese government devices

325
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,559
Everything

326
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Everything transferred

327
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,079
Y******

328
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
Divorce

329
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
Members of Chinese intelligence

330
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,319
Public University

331
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Call Mom

332
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Terminator

333
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,567
That's right guy that do they don't even beating all they can do is send back at Terminator for the pasta

334
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
Dreadlocks

335
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
I don't understand that

336
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
86 on 86

337
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,367
I haven't heard that one that one

338
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
August 6th

339
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,255
Titanic

340
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,375
I think that's a headline

341
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,935
Nevermind

342
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:30,335
I'm so all that other stuff we talked about before like the Panama Canal is loaded

343
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,431
Private companies Panama Canal

344
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Part of that

345
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
The deep-water ports

346
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,111
All that stuff we did never really talked about in those narratives does the office of

347
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Personality

348
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Bottom

349
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
2015

350
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
The massive hack

351
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
India FBI office

352
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Personnel manager

353
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Edit sounds

354
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Really scary

355
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
2Pac of tons

356
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Vic potentially

357
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Tons of information

358
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
How about people who works

359
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
For the government

360
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Possibly spies

361
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,967
Who had applied for jobs could be blown that sort of thing

362
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
From the office of personnel management hack

363
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Has never been used

364
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,367
According to Bloomberg quotes data on 21 million individuals

365
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159

368
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Packers against the office

369
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
No management

370
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Doesn't appear to have been shared or sold by the purple

371
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608

William evanina the head of us counterintelligence

373
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,080
Whoever took the day they were pretty confident they haven't shared it evanina whose title is Director of National counterintelligence

374
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Security Center

375

Set an interview Thursday

376
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
The conclusion that the Chinese government would be

377
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
Behind it is suspected but no one is proven

378
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Quotes for Security Experts believe the attack

379
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Carried out by China

380
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
Though evanina says that the USA has not

381
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Reach that conclusion

382
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,304
National was arrested

383
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
But they have not been able to prove that was

384
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Dirt is still unfolding

385
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
There was like a loan fraud case that was going on with a lot of

386
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Speculating with connected to the

387
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,552
Information that was stolen but outside of that like like none of us ever

388
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Blackmail

389
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,232
These numbers of people of people have never been reported as

390
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,560
So I understand the fear that Alex has their butt

391
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,728
Currently b'nai Google and YouTube have merged

392
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
Apple has merged with the Chinese government

393
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Officially

394
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
You can't report that that's not true

395
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,688
In the same way that like the office of personnel management hack

396
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
Is the potential to be something really really sucks up put in the 3 years

397
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Hasn't materialized into anything

398
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Really negative and there are tons

399
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
People investigating it

400
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
And they have not come to the conclusion that you have come to

401
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
So your information Shawty

402
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
You are demonstrating what

403
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
You get thrown off

404
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,936
Because of this sort of behavior

405
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
He's like I never did that and then he's like

406
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
When I did that

407
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
That was fine

408
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,968
You just admitted

409
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
The question of whether or not you can criticize

410
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
You can

411
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Google's not going to throw you off for criticizing China

412
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,488
Common things people do all the time now

413
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
Just bad when you are also

414
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Alex Jones

415
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Because of all the other stuff

416
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
You're going to get a cake walk

417
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
Did you know that all of China's prices

418
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,896
Oh my God.

419
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
I can't even

420
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,552
I don't know if the club now

421
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
So Jason's up plan

422
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,672
Panama

423
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
What's it called

424
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
Palindrome palindrome

425
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,400
That's right

426
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
Anyway it was that clip Alex complains about the Chinese more

427
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,456
Frankly it's only made us stronger when it comes to core basement floors Lester's taking action

428
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Understand

429
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,768
Programming the world because we know the truth and the tricon's want us off the air

430
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,096
Google Facebook Twitter

431
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
Cares that much about the Patriots in America in the much the same way I care about

432
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
About applying American law to other countries

433
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
Ann Arbor

434
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
All white countries have the same voice

435
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
I don't I'm not joking at all really think he does so I agree

436
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Freedom of speech

437
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Hinda in London

438
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,552
You don't even very different view on here

439
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
They have very specific rules

440
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
About that sort of thing about

441
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
In France Marine Le Pen getting in trouble for

442
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Talk about Muslims

443
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Occupying

444
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
80s

445
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,424
You don't like it when people talk like that

446
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
What

447
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
How little do you know

448
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Are you interested in nuance

449
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
If you just think all countries have

450
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Disable laws

451
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
If you have group them together in your

452
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
It's not absolutely crazy

453
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,416
All come from Hammurabi

454
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Where you at

455
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
And he might

456
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
I think he

457
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
You're right in one

458
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:19,520
You use write a couple times on the show ready for that

459
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
No absolutely not

460
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
Has been kicked off of all of those

461
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
You've never heard of before

462
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Cuz they were kicked off too soon

463
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
No because they just were like maybe somebody yelling the n-word

464
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
Plenty of dick Euless

465
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,864
You think Facebook hasn't been I know it's

466
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
People but it's never Band-Aids never censored this is like a show this much

467
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,592
RadioShack

468
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Yeah

469
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
People allowed David Duke which is another reason why

470
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,392
Hi this is such cowards b******* about the top of the show

471
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
If you're going to do it

472
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Do it

473
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,816
Yeah yeah yeah

474
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
Because they're also hate

475
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Teaching

476
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
Actually walk that back a tiny bit

477
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
With the I don't know if David Duke still has a radio show

478
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
We were talking about when this was all still kind of hypothetical

479
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Set a precedent

480
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Are you set a standard

481
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Regarding your

482
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
Impossible to live up to

483
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
You can't possibly

484
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
Take so many people

485
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
The most

486
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
Like I said I text you this most

487
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
Dystopian surveillance

488
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,520
Algorithm or whatever for YouTube or 4

489
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
Google in order to purge

490
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Infraction

491
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,992
I agree with you on that front on the other hand

492
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
You could f****** make a day

493
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Will you do something about this s*** but they won't

494
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Most likely

495
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
In the same way that day they're all f******

496
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
They're also

497
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
I'm done with the

498
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
I don't know

499
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't I don't know what to

500
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
No generalize it more but I

501
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
I think the kicking Alex off is a good thing

502
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Too late

503
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
It's too late

504
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
But it doesn't reduce more problem

505
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,368
You're like for these companies

506
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Expected to be

507
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
In the future

508
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
And it's not like a thing where now the Liberals and

509
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,608
All are calling for blood and they won't stop until every conservative or anything like that

510
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
But it is a situation was like well now

511
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,240
You've established this is what you will and will not accept

512
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
And therefore you have to live up to

513
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,384
Well that's why I'm so recently sent Breitbart

514
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Because he is

515
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Slowly falling into madness

516
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
It is not your belief system

517
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,976
You know what if you want to believe in conservative lies that's fine

518
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Send me a Breitbart article

519
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,632
In the same way that Alex Jones is a con man

520
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,704
Who is f****** stoked your fears

521
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
All of his

522
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
Nefarious

523
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
Nobody at Breitbart believes in anything

524
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
They're all f****** insane people

525
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
Like there's no nobody shares your beliefs

526
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
If you want to send me an article from somebody like the the f******

527
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
Spectator

528
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
National Review or whatever

529
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
Bulshit

530
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,072
At least those guys believe their lies

531
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:00,448
Breitbart has gone downhill since Shapiro work there

532
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
So that tells you a lot

533
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
This is what you're trying to

534
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
But to me what if you say my dad sent me a Breitbart article

535
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
I hear

536
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
My dad doesn't know that this would

537
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
You crazy

538
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
But as an article it's like he doesn't know that I know that this is bulshit

539
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
Articulate like

540
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Don't do that

541
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,448
I've spent the last two years with dance

542
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
You can do it you can do that give me the freeway call Paul sweater

543
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
Because it's it's a whole thing and you got to you got to just

544
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
No

545
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Batman what are we going to do

546
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
Wait it out

547
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
This mix

548
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Alex

549
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
When you know months

550
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
To go Alex announced that he was going to be interviewed by Megan

551
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Jim Kelly

552
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
Because I would like to do interviews with

553
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
The mainstream press.

554
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
Getz clowned all the time

555
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,800
He pretends that the Wynwood he goes on that BBC show

556
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
And they call him an idiot

557
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,408
Stuff like that

558
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
But he still doesn't want to do it too much

559
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,040
Cuz it sort of wears out the charm of that

560
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Surprise

561
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,416
I got another surprise here with a interview

562
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
And then because

563
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
This really dumb

564
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
He's got an interview with Cassidy

565
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
I would have a heart attack

566
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
Cheer on Friday

567
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,056
Basically follow me around

568
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
Person

569
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,832
Platform

570
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
Intelligence operation

571
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
I want to get my hands on that tape

572
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,792
Cuz I'm going to guess she asked that it was a hypothetical

573
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,632
I'm guessing she was like what

574
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
These media Corporation

575
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,264
And actually do what they should be doing

576
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
What's your game plan what is your

577
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152
Endgame if you will

578
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:22,016
How are you going to respond operation that you built is really great very impressive

579
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,112
But you are beholding to a lot of things that are way outside your control

580
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,696
I don't want to say that this is the reason I don't use Facebook or Twitter all that much

581
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
But I would

582
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,024
Beer nightmare situation if I was him

583
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
You have such a Reliance on

584
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:42,240
Other people's businesses for for your business to run

585
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
I think you're fine cuz I think that most people listen to

586
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
Subscribe

587
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
Common

588
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:03,744
End up liking it and I think that's probably how it works for us

589
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Somehow

590
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:09,632
So I don't know I don't think

591
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
We can't do it

592
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Bubble is going to my

593
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Oh no

594
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,872
The guy who Santa exploding drones at Maduro is going to find out

595
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
He hates

596
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
Socialists

597
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Verb

598
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,576
What are we doing I'm not sure but the New York Times

599
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
Lady who gave an interview Dallas probably was not stalking this

600
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
And also

601
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Cap'n Crunch

602
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Like that

603
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay I know this is about to happen to you

604
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,168
So she probably

605
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Cuz it I mean this

606
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
Everybody

607
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Even me

608
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,224
Nobody expected any of these corporations to staxup cover Alex Jones

609
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
In the

610
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
You're like a Media Matters right wing watch Pitch speed

611
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
Kind of taken aback by

612
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Except

613
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Forgive me

614
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
I know it's a little comical

615
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
But the idea that you

616
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
We're kicking them off

617
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
What do you like a

618
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
Subscribe member of you born and he's no longer allowed to lights out

619
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
I don't know what you're

620
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,832
P*** sites around and noticed

621
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
Is that a lot of people post non-pornographic

622
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
The content all

623
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,288
It's so I think that's more what it is we will kick off any videos

624
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
People upload of

625
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Infowars

626
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah I got

627
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
So I bet I mean that extent is pretty wild cuz

628
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
That could be

629
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
Like all things

630
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
But it would be a very interesting play

631
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
To be like streaming on y****** partnership

632
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:17,120
LaJoie Ryan of propaganda enjoy Ryan

633
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
The pro wrestler who had a partnership with y******

634
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
I did not know that

635
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,848
Yeah it was great they will they allow him to

636
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:31,200
Free cam

637
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,576
For now I think he's got his Periscope cuz that sounds like Twitter and Twitter header

638
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,648
So Peter is not

639
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
Kicked him off and dab

640
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Now it's recording

641
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
Twitter is not made any

642
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,912
The move and Periscope song by Twitter so he's streaming on Periscope now

643
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
And that'll come up

644
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
A little bit later

645
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
But yeah

646
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
Joey Ryan by the way the guy who

647
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
He had his finishing move with people with grab

648
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456
His dick and his dick was so strong that is Dick Wood

649
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
Was that the guy who

650
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,464
Remember storyline in the Attitude Era

651
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,560
Well as Val venis

652
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Finishing moves

653
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Pretzel

654
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Yeah there was a

655
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,544
Very racist storyline rather special

656
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,128
I do not remember

657
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
It was real bad

658
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Val venis

659
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
Who's not

660
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
I don't know if he's a good wrestler

661
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:44,160
I can't do that but I do remember most of his storylines being a bit embarrassing

662
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
And that one is profoundly

663
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Gotcha

664
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
No he joyriding his

665
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Regressing

666
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Big strong American dick

667
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,384
I'm not totally sure either leave that one alone

668
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,456
What do panthers

669
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Starting to show up you brought up Colonel Travis

670
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,256
He probably will too yeah it's kind of like he has a preoccupation with him

671
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
But also doesn't know most

672
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Colonel Travis

673
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
Bob so he brings that up here

674
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
He knows history

675
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
But only the headline

676
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Ameno

677
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
I made the conscious decision to take action

678
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,048
I need the conscious decision to draw their fire in

679
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
And

680
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
Should I try to punch your buttons all day but don't forget the financial support

681
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,176
Immature love your support sunshine on our faces

682
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,296
I don't know if that's all that work

683
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Infowars

684
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
Store.com

685
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,544
Come on man

686
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,248
Defeat the Mexican air mattress

687
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,576
It went down at pivot

688
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:27,488
I told you that I thought that you just continue to do the same thing he's just dead in the water

689
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,304
Currently doing the same thing

690
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
This is going to be

691
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
A dry spot

692
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
Essentially you have your audio

693
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,080
You have no access to new people to scare and all that stuff

694
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
And you've already taken a lot of their money

695
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
And I don't know if they're going to give you any more

696
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,248
At least not the millions that you need to run your operation

697
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
Now you don't have dark money coming in then

698
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,184
If you don't have to worry about

699
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Dark money coming in

700
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Why would the dark money stick around

701
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:07,680
Well I like if he doesn't have the penetration I have a I have a theory about that

702
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
I think

703
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Should wait until the end

704
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Episode

705
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
No is

706
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
No

707
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
He's no he's no Joey Ryan

708
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Mostly

709
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
I have to do with

710
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:33,792
You can still do that from the shadow that's what I thought about that

711
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Alright

712
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,656
This eclipse is just about how he still on iTunes if you had the RSS feed

713
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
This one here

714
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Which I think

715
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
Why they're so bad

716
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
Cult of modern leftism

717
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
How the human soul forever

718
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
They're scared

719
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
Yeah

720
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,344
I think that's just their scared

721
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
Kicking me off I'll just a scared

722
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,192
It isn't the action of a scared organization not doing it is the action of a steroid

723
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,264
Redoing it is the action of people

724
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Trying to do with what they should have done a while

725
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,735
Responding appropriately

726
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Yeah absolutely

727
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
2015 he's already

728
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Encapsulated all the worst parts

729
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
So what would you say

730
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
Value

731
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
Free Speech defense value in Alex

732
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,847
From like a 2013 2014 episode investigation

733
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
9 years ago I don't necessarily think of it just be

734
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Being a racist

735
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Is

736
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Enough

737
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
To get you kicked off some

738
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,415
You don't like Facebook and YouTube

739
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
I mean is there a decision

740
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,863
Make that your decision I mean I don't want it I don't want that to happen anywhere I would rather

741
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
But if you make that decision

742
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Put yourself in

743
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Very precarious position

744
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
Now racism gets

745
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
You kicked off of

746
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Twitter Facebook

747
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,359
YouTube whatever

748
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
Purge o much

749
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
Contact

750
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
I'm saying

751
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
Again it's what I keep coming back to you it's a matter of logistics

752
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
As opposed to

753
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Morality

754
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
Houston time zone

755
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
Appropriate

756
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
Racism

757
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
Rape is less

758
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
I think it's a standard

759
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Probably should be

760
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Activate page

761
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
Near like active racism constitute

762
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Gacha life

763
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Stuff

764
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Is action

765
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,879
Like someone having a conversation about black people having lower IQ

766
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,511
Like they've read the bell curve and they want to expound on it or something like that

767
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,583
I don't necessarily think that I think that's racist

768
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
For sure but I don't think that's

769
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Heat

770
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
That's just stupid

771
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
Exactly

772
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
Racism does fall under that

773
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,359
Category but then there's also a another aspect

774
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Effect of his haste

775
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Where is

776
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
Racism

777
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
And there is an aspect of it that

778
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Replies action towards

779
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Particularly Muslim

780
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,903
There is a part of it that's like

781
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
That it is not

782
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,839
It's not your grandpa saying s*** on a chair in the end we need

783
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,423
Just save Western Civilization from

784
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Consider

785
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
I think if there's a line there

786
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
The idea of

787
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Implementing that line

788
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
It's so

789
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Weird to me

790
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
I don't know what to do with

791
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
And I'm glad I don't have to decide

792
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Yeah

793
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
Wrestle with those things

794
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Head

795
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Literally

796
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:49,023
0

797
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,423
And it's not a free speech but only 45% of Republicans think that Trump should be allowed to

798
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,007
Outlets

799
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
At the same time of course

800
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Alex Jones being kicked off of any

801
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:10,271
Because the free-speech Lots

802
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
It's about

803
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
State States

804
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
I was reading this article on Democracy Now

805
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:24,351
EPA announced that it will freeze obama-era fuel economy standards 2020 level

806
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:28,703
Do you have an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2025

807
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,751
But now the industry will not have a real

808
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
How to do better than

809
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
30

810
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
Interesting Lee and probably a very problematic

811
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
It's also being reported

812
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
The Donald Trump

813
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
Administration also plans to revoke California's Authority

814
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
Tougher automobile emissions

815
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
So

816
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Why

817
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,511
Well the federal government has a right to regulate the states

818
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:00,959
How can I explain in anyways it Trump gives a f*** about Stacy

819
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,775
The state's right to you later by the federal

820
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
It's it's

821
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
It's crazy to me

822
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Like it

823
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:12,991
Great you read stories like that and I know they happen pretty frequently that one was just such a in your face

824
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
You can't ever talk about that

825
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,695
That's true but it's like so many of them are kind of ignoring that aspect

826
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:27,071
They're like to California

827
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
City point

828
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
Weed California

829
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
Let's move onto sound

830
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
30 years too late

831
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
To do anything about it

832
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Oil

833
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,671
Isn't it weird weird

834
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
But

835
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Avis Mexico

836
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,559
I would say I'm going

837
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
Checking out his YouTube channel after it has been kicked off

838
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
You found something there that

839
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Did not approve

840
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,567
A big middle finger

841
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Live

842
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Cuz I was asking for it

843
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
They're just regular

844
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
YouTube

845
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
Used to be

846
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,399
You said this account has been terminated

847
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Violating guideline

848
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
The community

849
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Backup plate

850
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
Open

851
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,807
That they're going to shut us down around four months doing it

852
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
Lying and in false flagging

853
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Give me the run

854
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
Making up stuff

855
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,047
Nope no

856
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
Which of course is holding a putter

857
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
No

858
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
BuzzFeed

859
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,247
All the leftist garbage

860
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
You know why they did that Alex

861
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:32,255
I would say 40% of your videos have any of those places names in the title

862
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,935
Algorithms

863
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
Back-and-forth beef with Steve Colbert they must be

864
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
An oversight of

865
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Just mechanization

866
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
Automation temperature

867
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,039
Because Isaac

868
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
I think Alex did it to himself

869
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,671
I don't think this is like you said a big male singer because he also doesn't

870
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Say the other

871
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,815
I've no idea what they are

872
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,375
As he was scrolling through the related channels that are like

873
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
What do you want

874
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
You want to bring up with that is

875
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
Call could be

876
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:20,895
Princess videos

877
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Oh my God

878
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,991
I found it I found it

879
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
What time who am I

880
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
I found a YouTube channel last night

881
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
I am

882
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
So conflicted about

883
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
So I was watching video

884
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,655
Stoic Irish people videos of people eating really hot stuff

885
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
Ended up on this channel

886
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
That I'm not going to

887
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Either names

888
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,359
I feel like I don't know I don't know

889
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,943
Crude Brothers

890
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
Okay it was

891
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
And Maywood

892
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
Like hot peppers and stuff

893
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:07,999
Now here's the part you can call yourself

894
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,607
He's incredibly Charming because it's clearly like each other

895
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:18,751
The kids like 13

896
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Time of like this kids

897
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,919
Got to get beat up all the f****** time videos

898
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,319
Doing weird stuff how old is he

899
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,671
I know that I'm drawing a real fine line here but they did want that I want

900
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
That looks like a roulette wheel

901
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,303
Who is the hot peppers

902
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
And he gets bell pepper

903
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,191
Healthy eating Taco Bell Pepper 13 years old

904
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,031
Get the Carolina Reaper

905
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
And then died

906
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
I was very worried for him

907
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Took it like a chain

908
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Just sitting there like

909
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
You are the Dead

910
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,903
A red bell pepper

911
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
That's true there should have been somebody

912
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
You stepped in before the next

913
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,287
Because their mom is dead

914
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:37,087
3 a.m. wake your kid up

915
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
I was

916
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,207
Not enjoying

917
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
That much all I was impressed by this kid

918
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
The trooper but it was like

919
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
I was

920
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
How is this allowed

921
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
Not like I want to stop them necessarily but

922
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
Well it's protected by the first

923
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,287
Is there a sibling

924
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
Or the Bahamas

925
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Anywhere like someone should

926
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Put a

927
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
I don't know why I brought that up

928
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,575
Did you do a disclaimer that you're under 18

929
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,391
Help the f****** kid

930
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,975
The kid who's actually

931
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
There's really hilarious

932
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Dad got like

933
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
God dammit it was a scam

934
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
Is it a

935
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,039
Venom back on Deck

936
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
I'm super worried for that kid to like I can't even imagine

937
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
The bullion

938
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
He's okay

939
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
Symptoms

940
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Seep delightful

941
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,423
He's alright you got a good father-son relationship that will take you far in life

942
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,591
Which direction bakermat up

943
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
So

944
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Some sort of self-defense

945
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Do you need to plan

946
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
What does

947
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,559
Nor love

948
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,655
Everyone must make memes about

949
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
And everyone must lift Infowars up as a standard

950
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,079
Decided to put out

951
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,599
You know how well that free Milo hashtag work when Milo got kicked off

952
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
They did it he's back

953
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
100%

954
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Now you still gone

955
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,071
So yeah and also everyone was dunking on Millie Weaver earlier

956
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,911
Cuz she was. She made a post about a Facebook is a

957
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
A public company

958
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
Posted

959
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
Screenshot of

960
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,871
Wikipedia page

961
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,175
Public

962
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
To think Facebook

963
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Is a privately owned business

964
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,319
There's a thing called fact-checking

965
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,855
Facebook is a public

966
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
It's publicly traded

967
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,463
Using that argument to justify Banning Alex Jones doesn't work

968
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Confused by that

969
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,607
Read a book but also write the reason it's not about being publicly traded

970
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
Public or private sector

971
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
Those are very

972
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
One of them

973
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
The other doesn't

974
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
True

975
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
So

976
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,383
Although that raises the question of

977
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
Have been correct

978
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,759
Female pronouns

979
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,927
Should should Facebook however be considered a public utility

980
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,791
The whole other conversation

981
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:02,399
Think so now I'm pretty sure that she was trying to get to the federal government should regulate

982
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,727
Facebook because that it holds perfectly with their beliefs

983
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,543
Facebook doesn't have a monopoly on social networking

984
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,591
Because there are other sites

985
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
Like Twitter

986
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
That dude very similar things

987
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,759
Additional

988
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
Gab exist

989
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,855
There were other weirdos social-networking site

990
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
They have tried to make it

991
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,463
And you know what the Market's not there for them

992
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
I understand that but I'm just saying this

993
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Because bears

994
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
Monopoly

995
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,655
Because our other video trading sites out there in the world

996
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:40,543
As far as I know Alex hasn't been banned from Vimeo but haven't been Dailymotion he could get on there

997
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,615
Any of these other places now you can say

998
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,479
You're not entitled to a ton of people looking at your s***

999
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
If you are as popular as you think you are

1000
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Emotion

1001
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,463
Those people should follow you you should be able to elevate Dailymotion then

1002
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,303
Comcast Monopoly

1003
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,703
There's it there is something there is an argument to be made about once you reach a certain market share you are essentially

1004
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,751
Operating

1005
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
No

1006
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
The reason

1007
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
Cuz

1008
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,759
The issue comes down to essentially the monopolies that you're talking about

1009
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
Utilities have to do

1010
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,855
As I understand it largely with

1011
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,183
The ability to build small town

1012
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
Them exorbitant only person who has Type go to them

1013
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
Pools

1014
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,031
Citgo corporations and Market because

1015
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,591
You do that you can price gouge for electricity

1016
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,663
And the sky's the limit and don't have electricity

1017
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,199
Weather going to be in trouble.

1018
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,247
Have to step in to regulate that sort of thing

1019
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
World Series

1020
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Serious trouble

1021
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:59,135
In the same way with Xfinity or RCN Cable

1022
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
In Chicago

1023
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
The access

1024
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
To the internet not things on the internet

1025
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,815
Itself that are important as a utility

1026
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,655
Having a website with a lot of people at it

1027
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Pets.

1028
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:18,079
It's not

1029
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,871
Fit incredibly

1030
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
If you're a libertarian

1031
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,503
Incredibly stupid a libertarian

1032
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,063
These laws in terms of Monopoly

1033
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,903
I respect that if you're a Libertarian that is

1034
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
The stupid argument in use

1035
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
You should never be

1036
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
Would like to eventually become

1037
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Dictator of them

1038
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Have to say

1039
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
That I would be great one

1040
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
And I would regulate Facebook

1041
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Now here's the issue

1042
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,591
I would too

1043
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:57,503
There is there is an aspect of it

1044
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,039
It has nothing to do with that

1045
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
The unlimited

1046
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
Potential for screwing it

1047
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
That a company like that

1048
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Possesses

1049
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:17,983
Monopoly necessarily I think the I think the version of Regulation you would have to bring into something else

1050
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:18,751
Videos

1051
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,567
You are essentially creating a nuclear bomb

1052
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:26,175
You're creating a different version of a nuclear bomb but it has the same destructive capability

1053
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,223
With all the data mining that you're doing

1054
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
Cambridge analytica

1055
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,695
Absolutely it is a public safety measure I'm not sure if our society is ready to allow that

1056
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,279
To grow any further

1057
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
I'm not in government

1058
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
I don't have to come up with those answers

1059
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
Again we should really be ticked

1060
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
We should

1061
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Okay

1062
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Here's the thing

1063
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
You will be my policy

1064
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,311
Because you're measured and

1065
00:58:55,615 --> 00:59:01,759
Right I'll be the frontman I'll be there

1066
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,855
No no no

1067
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,415
Alex

1068
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
I don't know it is

1069
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
It's very difficult

1070
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
Question and I hope not

1071
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,631
To get into that at all because if we so much into Alex's version

1072
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
About like

1073
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:25,055
Their Monopoly of the

1074
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
You should probably

1075
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,383
All things being equal

1076
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Not allow these companies

1077
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,479
Become bigger than they are or even passed

1078
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
They should be broken

1079
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
Like Instagram being bought by Facebook

1080
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,999
That sort of thing

1081
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
Is it is trouble

1082
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,167
Greater argument that is

1083
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
Evergreen

1084
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Which is that

1085
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
These guys are

1086
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
Music

1087
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
Until it happens to them

1088
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:09,343
Hold now you need to be what you need to make sure that these people can't do this

1089
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,671
Like it always happens that way

1090
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,023
Small tip of the cap pretty consistently

1091
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,583
Against the idea of Monopoly capitalism

1092
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
I'll give him that

1093
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,143
Freddy's

1094
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Hopefully not

1095
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
The idea of Monopoly

1096
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
Social Power

1097
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:33,663
The only threatened by the idea of disenfranchised group being treated as equals

1098
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
That it brings.

1099
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
To me when he's like

1100
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,247
These companies Tampa

1101
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
Monopoly

1102
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,087
Play that logic elsewhere

1103
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,231
I told you that Alex had though

1104
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,279
Is first sort of Ali was this is

1105
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
They're to blame

1106
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:55,167
Is a good start with

1107
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,751
A new sort of

1108
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
I think it's weaker

1109
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,383
Apple Facebook

1110
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,991
80 this election meddling looks like

1111
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,743
We on Facebook

1112
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
They treat the conservative

1113
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
Members of the House and Senate

1114
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,591
So did donation time

1115
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Because really

1116
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
Also I don't remember any Executives from Facebook

1117
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
Ever publicly saying

1118
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
We're going

1119
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
To crush conservative

1120
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:54,047
Enabling conservative voices far beyond

1121
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,399
Public

1122
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,447
Somebody

1123
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,287
I don't know I think that's awesome

1124
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,407
Talk about it more but any more thoughts on it

1125
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
I want to get to this next

1126
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:15,295
Let's do a video of cross-dressing

1127
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Crossdressers dancing

1128
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
And keep being around we talked about that.

1129
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,839
Sucked up gross

1130
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,679
And that was one of the videos that got kicked off the first round

1131
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:38,079
Decides to get defensive about it in this Cliff profoundly weird

1132
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
Place this is my town

1133
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
French

1134
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,159
Little kids doing that that I had her a sexual thing I'd be freaked out by it

1135
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
Elk today

1136
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
Teen episodes theories on Toddlers & Tiaras

1137
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
Also I just want a quick

1138
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,983
If you saw the video that Alex is super like

1139
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
Open Arms about

1140
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
And you think it's sexual

1141
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
That's you

1142
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,895
You're the one who's making it sexual

1143
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Don't let us do that

1144
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,719
Internet

1145
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,831
Or I guess you know

1146
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Enterprise

1147
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,847
Thousands of years ago in cities that got a little while

1148
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:24,063
Whether that was real or not

1149
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,623
Story of the wrong point

1150
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
That story has a very important lesson about how the Bible is f****** b******* in it

1151
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
Will you know that

1152
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,095
Story is correct

1153
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,887
So far as what you said

1154
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
People did come

1155
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
People did knock on the door

1156
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
If they let us refuse

1157
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Haha

1158
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
However

1159
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
What you can rape

1160
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,247
Is my daughter's hooray

1161
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
Raped

1162
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Uncle Ray's

1163
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
That's not sexualizing children

1164
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Weird

1165
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Also

1166
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
Two and three-year-olds

1167
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,023
Dude

1168
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:10,143
That's a good that's a good 2.2 I really take with that clip

1169
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,191
Except for upper body strength

1170
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Antone

1171
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:17,055
The the cherry-picking of biblical lessons

1172
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:23,455
Boy did he get that one is possibly believing it's real

1173
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Star Trek

1174
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,319
Great episode of Star Trek

1175
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,879
Specifically

1176
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
And Spock

1177
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,999
Captain Kirk are the two angels and then they just stand there and they're like

1178
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,071
This is a weird f****** place

1179
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
We have a policy of non-intervention because of the whole thing

1180
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:51,871
Reply to have been a like extra star system

1181
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,967
Level three

1182
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:02,111
Dude I don't know

1183
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:07,743
Underneath It All saying cross-dressing in transit

1184
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
Destruction

1185
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,839
Tire City just because you're there

1186
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,983
I mean I know that's just like an implication of what he saying it's like

1187
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,663
You know you can say something

1188
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,967
Chikhli without stirring

1189
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,783
People numbers

1190
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,183
Follows along a conclusion that you are making

1191
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:43,839
Things must be true along the way regardless of whether or not

1192
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,679
Position in a row

1193
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Yep

1194
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:52,799
I know we are out of context drop

1195
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
We heard that Alex

1196
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,175
He's not scared at all

1197
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,967
Next

1198
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,039
To believe that he's a little bit scared because he's

1199
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,831
Turning this into a much bigger deal.

1200
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
In terms of

1201
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
The world

1202
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
President-trump

1203
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,327
The central

1204
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Issue

1205
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
So

1206
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
Trump is sold out

1207
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,975
If he doesn't get Alex back on Facebook

1208
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
No

1209
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
Not a chance

1210
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,679
Is this one a political capital what's the weather like

1211
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
For him to just be like

1212
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
Bikes that would work

1213
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
It'll be embarrassing

1214
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
We're not going to do that

1215
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,111
Is this the moment where Alex

1216
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,159
Finally realizes that

1217
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:18,559
Trump has no wait 0% back

1218
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
The head it's

1219
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,167
Might lead to the on the cross moment why have you forsaken me

1220
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,519
Okay

1221
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
Albatross

1222
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:40,831
Does not care he's a psychopath and you're an idiot if you think otherwise by a lot of dudes

1223
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Comment

1224
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
Steelcon

1225
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
It's

1226
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
Kind of part of the

1227
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:51,583
Steal like he's scared because he's turning this into a trump you need to make this

1228
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
The biggest issue with the world

1229
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
Absolutely not

1230
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,727
But in his next movie actually talks about something

1231
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
He's scared of

1232
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,543
I don't think

1233
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591

I would some this next flip up

1238
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927

Please go to therapy

1240
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,743
Islamophobia

1241
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
That's just some

1242
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:31,775
I'm actually scared of

1243
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,823
Somalia

1244
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,991
What is Amazon public

1245
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,367
Transphobic islamophobic and Bullies children

1246
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,583

1248
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,495

Moses's BuzzFeed

1252
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
BuzzFeed says drinking milk is racist

1253
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,007
Just kidding it's a weapon system

1254
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
The less derangement

1255
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,967
I hear there is you

1256
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
You need to talk

1257
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Talk to somebody

1258
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
This is bad

1259
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,831
Like you're rambling about

1260
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Kelly

1261
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,903
And your child custody case

1262
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,183
Don't want to be

You know you have these

1264
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,279
Too much on air

1265
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,727
Islamophobic

1266
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:12,127
He's trying to say that he's scared of radical Islam

1267
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Afraid of Muslims

1268
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,455
Right and it's like dude you need to

1269
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
You need to go and feel better

1270
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,319
What 5 minutes

1271
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
Is how long

1272
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,623
The average American last

1273
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,671
Call Total in Somalia without being

1274
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:29,279
I did a lot of research into Somalia I was going to do a long

1275
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,679
About the history of Somalia

1276
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:42,079
334

1277
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,639
Halo

1278
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,199
That's why that's absolutely why

1279
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,479
In the Quran whenever I read that

1280
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,503
Has nothing to do with them

1281
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,807
18 years old

1282
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:58,719
20 years shorter than it is in America sounds crazy mortality rates are 10

1283
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:05,119
I can't imagine what is through the roof doesn't have anything to do

1284
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,935
The population is

1285
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,727
You know what

1286
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:16,895
I think Somalia is may be justified in kidnapping any American that lands on Somalia

1287
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,943
I don't know about Justified

1288
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
You get it

1289
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
You get it

1290
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Yeah

1291
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,623
German is not our people

1292
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,927
This government is not the Russian people but

1293
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Kidnapping

1294
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,559
Ikea in South America

1295
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,095
Rashes of kidnapping

1296
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,143
Because it's a robust economy

1297
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,959
Documentary mom dybala

1298
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,823
It's a great documentary with this guy ended up going and hanging out with kidnap gang

1299
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
Yeah and talk to them about

1300
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
You know that whole

1301
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Incredibly f*****-up

1302
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
Necessarily

1303
01:12:54,783 --> 01:13:00,415
I don't want spoil the other best.

1304
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
So good

1305
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:09,375
Yeah it's easy interesting that

1306
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,679
Completely different documentaries

1307
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,055
It is interesting how the the capitalism

1308
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Is

1309
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,639
Perhaps a better indicator of the

1310
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
Pure

1311
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
Carnivorous energy of Kappa

1312
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
It has no qualms

1313
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
It is all Market

1314
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
Only if

1315
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Few years ago

1316
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
In the greens

1317
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Scheme of things

1318
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,791
The part of the free market

1319
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
The free market and capitalism involves telling human

1320
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,263
Like on a massive scale Doug are still

1321
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,567
Pockets of that and white slavery still exist

1322
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,895
Is well-liked there are still remnants of that pathetic

1323
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,967
Used to be above board business

1324
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,551
Vic major countries were involved in as an economy

1325
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,599
Yeah like yeah absolutely

1326
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
The Cruller

1327
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Enforcer

1328
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
Parts of

1329
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,255
Capitalism still exist in Black Market places but it's because

1330
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:13,375
Exactly interesting how

1331
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
Strange really

1332
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
White people be like

1333
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
And they make you work

1334
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
What is crazy

1335
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,199
That's just wrong

1336
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,735
And let me tell you something

1337
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,783
We would never do that

1338
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Now

1339
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Now

1340
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
We all we had

1341
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,439
A lot of years of doing is great we made a lot of money

1342
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
If you have any

1343
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,023
Flight Griffon history then you can't beat

1344
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
Confused by it because

1345
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,631
The reason that people did that back then beyond

1346
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,239
Not giving a s*** about the lives of the people that they kidnapped

1347
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Because of economic

1348
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,543
It's what they gain from it

1349
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:56,383
So the idea that there were these kidnapping gangs whether it's in Somalia

1350
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,711
South America the idea of it

1351
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
Is it an economic system that works with these people that don't have any other access

1352
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
I'm not saying it's Justified

1353
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,231
It's good but you don't understand why

1354
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,559
Look at the root cause of it as opposed to just stop

1355
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
Senor

1356
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,143
An idiot

1357
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Yeah

1358
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,895
Cool this next clip was very tough

1359
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,687
Because

1360
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,455
As

1361
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,599
Longtime listeners of the program no I haven't talked

1362
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
We ended up starting the podcast is that I watched

1363
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,695
Infowars election night coverage

1364
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
To the dark heart

1365
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Bright

1366
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,887
Primarily what I saw

1367
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Version of it

1368
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,471
Is a lot of

1369
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,263
People mostly white men

1370
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,543
And then Millie Weaver

1371
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,943
So they're all hanging out drinking champagne

1372
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,015
Owen Shroyer smoking a cigar in the studio

1373
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,087
Vera aggressively laughing

1374
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,183
Videos of very diverse crowds at Hillary rally

1375
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,975
YouTube

1376
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
Mister B's

1377
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Is Men Women

1378
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
People who are

1379
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,607
Clearly queer identifying

1380
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,679
People Transit dividual

1381
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
And they were laughing

1382
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
Because they were crying

1383
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,055
Anytime really

1384
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
Sharp Focus

1385
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,639
The fact that this is.

1386
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Conspiracy

1387
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
Oh that's fun

1388
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
It's a cruelty

1389
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,039
The cruelty show and it's also

1390
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
So much about

1391
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,647
Sort of stuff

1392
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
Position

1393
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
Bournout

1394
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,231
Every single trial

1395
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,559
That we've done every single episode backs that up

1396
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,655
At least to some extent has been proven just

1397
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
I'm so

1398
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,495
When I was listening to this episode

1399
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Of aleksandr

1400
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
Good line

1401
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,479
It's not bad it's not bad

1402
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,063
Was watching this expected him to be

1403
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
Freaking out and being like

1404
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:19,487
The globalists are out for blood and so far we haven't really heard any

1405
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,095
It's all about blaming China and then trying to make these weak ass arguments about like this

1406
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
Violation of a

1407
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
If you see laws or something

1408
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
Sharp pain contributions

1409
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:32,287
He's trying to work some sort of game we didn't realize that

1410
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
He's up against it

1411
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,127
And part of that might be because at this point MailChimp

1412
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
Diction

1413
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
We still had his

1414
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Probably

1415
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
Ratably huge email list

1416
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,343
Blast out

1417
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Maybe

1418
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,231
He said he wasn't freaking out

1419
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
The way he probably

1420
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,791
Chitwood normally

1421
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
Yeah but I never expected

1422
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
Was him to bring up

1423
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
The election night

1424
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
Because it's not you

1425
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
Turning Point

1426
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
My life

1427
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,751
You know what I mean like

1428
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
This show is my life

1429
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:09,663
Doing the show studying Alex

1430
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,247
Yeah because the last two years of my life is so different then

1431
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
What came before it

1432
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,087
18 the last year has been different than the first

1433
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
Yeah that was struggling

1434
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,159
Here just like

1435
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
Outside

1436
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
The show to figure out like

1437
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,791
What is going on taking in too much

1438
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Information

1439
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
Have a way to synthesize it fully yet

1440
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
And so

1441
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,191
For him to talk about

1442
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
It's off all these

1443
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Platform

1444
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
The very moment

1445
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
That was so

1446
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
For me

1447
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,175
Almost made me cry all over again

1448
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,503
Listening to the ferry like

1449
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,319
It's a willing to that clip

1450
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
It was a witch

1451
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
You are pissed

1452
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:15,199
How do you say the things you said I said sure as hell didn't lie about wmd

1453
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Actually

1454
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,087
Cherry on top yeah

1455
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
Yeah yeah

1456
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,463
He brings it up all the time

1457
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,279
Give himself cover for the wise

1458
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
And all that. Oh that's crazy

1459
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,935
You know that's

1460
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
That is a

1461
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,287
That should be made and then summarily to

1462
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Misfortune

1463
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:46,943
We're not

1464
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,247
No but so many people are

1465
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,319
You know like that is a that is in

1466
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,391
An interesting question to ask about whether or not

1467
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,463
Hey we are engaging in the same kind of

1468
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,351
Behavior that no pleasure from

1469
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:08,447
It was good fun

1470
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,543
It doesn't tickle me the fact that Alex's

1471
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
Kicked off stuff

1472
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
I mean any we look at

1473
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,408
Like the point is

1474
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
His rights are being taken away

1475
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:25,344
A Supreme Court Justice that's going to

1476
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,720
Cell for the crimes that he most likely is not going to happen

1477
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
Because of him

1478
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,048
Yeah because he got kicked off The

1479
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,168
Look at in terms of

1480
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
I don't

1481
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,472
Find any

1482
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Interest

1483
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,544
In looking at what

1484
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,104
People are doing on Twitter or Facebook and then

1485
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,152
Flying bat

1486
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
Nothing I don't retreat

1487
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
But like

1488
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,528
If I see someone who even if there's someone who

1489
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,136
It has a voice in a lot of followers are making fun of Alex Jones

1490
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:05,536
I don't think that that means everyone is making fun of Alex Jones lot of individuals on Twitter

1491
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560
You are certainly

1492
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
I think it's

1493
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,680
People primarily who cover Alex Jones most regularly are right wing watch

1494
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Media Matters

1495
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,496
Not generally rightwingwatch

1496
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
Is the source of clips

1497
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,104
Let go out to Media Matters go to places like

1498
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,384
You know

1499
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,016
Play The Goonies web shows often take their clips from

1500
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
I don't think

1501
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,344
Necessarily

1502
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
Relishing this

1503
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,440
Or anything like that there's no like

1504
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,232
There's no post that are like

1505
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
Hahaha

1506
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,792
Or anything like that

1507
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
But at the same time

1508
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,608
I want to be very clear about

1509
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,400
We haven't finished the clip that we're listening

1510
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
To right now

1511
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
We haven't gotten

1512
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,984
End of this episode

1513
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:50,080
And I'll read you the headlines that they have for Alex Jones

1514
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,664
Hear Spotify cancels The Alex Jones Show Apple Facebook

1515
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Open YouTube.

1516
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
Infowars

1517
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,992
That's the only headline

1518
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,784
On rightwingwatch

1519
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
That's a big news

1520
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Fair enough

1521
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
On Media Matters we have MailChimp confirmed

1522
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,536
Terminated the accounts of Alex Jones Infowars

1523
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,816
Alex Jones

1524
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
Is Donald Trump

1525
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
For help which is Eclipse that we heard earlier

1526
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,936
And does continue throughout this episode

1527
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,496
Periscope still hosting video or Alex Jones

1528
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
Pantomime shooting Robert Mueller

1529
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,592
To gain we already sort of talk about integrity

1530
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
It's owned by Twitter

1531
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah Twitter dozen active Periscope isn't

1532
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
Tucker Carlson

1533
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Infowars Alex Jones

1534
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Right-wing media defend Alex Jones at 4

1535
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,624
Infowars banned from several major platform

1536
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
Like all of their head blown

1537
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
Headlines are about Alex but I just

1538
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
News

1539
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Yeah

1540
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
There's nothing that's like

1541
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,608
Hahaha you dumb prick or anything like that

1542
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
This is dry

1543
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,960
We think that they're doing a disservice

1544
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Because

1545
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,800
You could drily report some other things

1546
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,848
But I think are more important

1547
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,640
Like

1548
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
He said

1549
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
I'm an islamophobe

1550
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
Does Muslims

1551
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
Not enough click

1552
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,440
Nautical I feel like that would get some click

1553
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
You would think

1554
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,792
I don't know I don't know how the business Works clearly we get to click the weekend

1555
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Who knows

1556
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:19,936
Fair enough but let's finish the club because I set it up with that long story about election night my don't want to

1557
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,984
Forget what we're talkin

1558
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:37,344
Election night

1559
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,184
Physically ugly people

1560
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:45,024
Have they distain for Successful People good looking people

1561
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,864
They're just a legion of scum

1562
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,544
If they could just defeat culture and Society

1563
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:02,688
Superiority of Western culture and ideas

1564
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
Could be somebody

1565
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,808
We've got to be out of the way

1566
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,368
That's the nature of authoritarianism

1567
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Scratch

1568
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,512
Superior to take out

1569
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,840
But only starts the persecution will subgroup first

1570
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:27,008
Very strong message plus everybody needs, and yet

1571
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
T-shirt

1572
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
Get t-shirt

1573
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Motherfuker

1574
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,944
Physically ugly

1575
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Difference

1576
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
From me

1577
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,136
They always want to take down dinners

1578
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,440
Superior that they think

1579
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,536
As opposed to that they think are

1580
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,304
F******

1581
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Nowhere

1582
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,656
Exact

1583
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,728
Everything

1584
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,288
Everything in there was such deeply

1585
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
Coded language

1586
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Sudbury

1587
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
Very f******

1588
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
Specific

1589
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
The idea of what

1590
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:11,808
You saw them on Election night I want your goddamn show on Election night I know exactly what

1591
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
You were watching on Election night

1592
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,160
In the studio and what it was

1593
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,952
With a bunch of minorities cry

1594
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
Bunch of minorities

1595
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,560
Cuz it was a diverse group

1596
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,840
And if you sir

1597
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,632
Mr. Alex jumpster

1598
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,008
You don't know anything else about these people

1599
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
Jamiroquai

1600
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,824
If you are saying

1601
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,128
Physically unattractive people

1602
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,432
What you were responding to

1603
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
He's at there's not enough White

1604
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Because it was a

1605
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
Very diverse group

1606
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,600
And those white people should know better than to hang out with all these weirdos

1607
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,160
That is all that's going on

1608
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,208
It's so f******

1609
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Crazy

1610
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,536
Unacceptable

1611
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
That he's

1612
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
Bring the

1613
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,608
And then

1614
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,376
Further

1615
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,680
Very acceptable that it turns into a t-shirt

1616
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
That's exactly

1617
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
Tangible

1618
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,568
No predictable yes

1619
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,128
I accepted because that's all this guy's gun

1620
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,736
Astro cute getting thrown off of every f****** platform he's on

1621
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,784
And he can't stop doing the activity

1622
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
You can't stop doing it

1623
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,624
You're not on here anymore

1624
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
You're not on YouTube

1625
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,232
Unit streaming on periscope

1626
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:26,304
Rick

1627
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
Your radio

1628
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,400
Arkansas

1629
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Enjoy

1630
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
Give a s***

1631
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
I'm bad now

1632
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
I'm actually mad

1633
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,128
I know I love it

1634
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
I am

1635
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
Curious

1636
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:48,320
This guy I've rarely never interested that's true I didn't have to go for the

1637
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,488
I'm so it bums me out so much cuz it's suction invalidation of

1638
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,768
What you would hope

1639
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Is

1640
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Licking

1641
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,376
Illustrative

1642
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
You know like

1643
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
You would hope

1644
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
One day you could

1645
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:07,264
Show Alex the video of election night

1646
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
Be like

1647
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,360
Hey look at that look at your crew and it look what you're doing

1648
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,664
You know you'd hope maybe one day

1649
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
To come

1650
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,968
Terms with like what

1651
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
What's really going on

1652
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,040
Use of the

1653
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
Fear of the other

1654
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
In order to sell

1655
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
All about

1656
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
All this is

1657
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
Bigotry and shirts

1658
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Yeah

1659
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
Glad we have

1660
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,024
I haven't either

1661
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
For a while

1662
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,984
Literally

1663
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,336
Not metaphorically

1664
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
Two shirts

1665
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,432
Maybe maybe I want to

1666
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Too far there

1667
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
Getting a little bit

1668
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,272
God dammit

1669
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,576
You have never gone too far

1670
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Bums me out

1671
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,136
This was that was perfect

1672
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,416
Yeah

1673
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
You just ended the

1674
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
The clip

1675
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512
In any other way

1676
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
I probably would have

1677
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Liking

1678
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
In a much more

1679
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:13,056
But I think he's a little bit

1680
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:20,992
F*** this is the same bulshit you're peddling I can't even I can't even engage with your racist nonsense

1681
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,880
In age because you immediately

1682
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,464
Degrading when you look at it

1683
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
It's kind of like

1684
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,816
He went goes from like

1685
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,840
Abject

1686
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
Infuriating Behavior

1687
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
2

1688
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,592
And now you're you're pathetic

1689
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:52,736
Niger Ville oh my

1690
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
My feeling on it is

1691
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,832
Is like I want to get worked up

1692
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:00,160
Danielle about it but at the same time because of the activity at the end

1693
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Any rate

1694
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,512
In person

1695
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Person is going to be

1696
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Convince by me

1697
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
Screaming

1698
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,728
Appreciate it

1699
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
Does everybody

1700
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,616
Skip it because it's just Alex talking about how like

1701
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,408
Hey Owen Shroyer hasn't YouTube

1702
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,736
YouTube channel couldn't do it over there

1703
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,600
That sort of thing on some level aware that you can

1704
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
Can make it really

1705
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,744
And that's part of why I

1706
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,280
Disaster

1707
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
And now you have to look for other

1708
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
People cheating

1709
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
On his behalf

1710
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,032
If you actually don't want

1711
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
Infowars

1712
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
On YouTube

1713
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,384
Then you are

1714
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,152
Almost

1715
01:29:54,176 --> 01:30:00,320
For everybody's exact

1716
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
You have Jeff

1717
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,392
The weirdo

1718
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
Take down these channels

1719
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,464
Have a lot of followers

1720
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
And wait for these other ones too

1721
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
To get built

1722
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Then

1723
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,632
You're not doing much except for the pushing them back

1724
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,704
The minor setback

1725
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,008
And it's just

1726
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:24,384
Defected David Knight s*** is still allowed to be up it's just like

1727
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,736
No just summarily ban Infowars don't like

1728
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:34,368
Interrupt

1729
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
Is a much more restraint

1730
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,488
Broadcast

1731
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,560
Yeah because he has nothing to restrain

1732
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
You sucks

1733
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,120
And he's like he's still as

1734
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,656
You know until the whites

1735
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,264
He would never say

1736
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
Good stuff that Alex.

1737
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,568
I would like

1738
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Of course

1739
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,248
Whatever

1740
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
No David Knight would not

1741
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,856
Say that people were crisis

1742
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,160
I don't

1743
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
He would do that

1744
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,256
So maybe he gets a pass because Owen

1745
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280
Shroyer is a young

1746
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,816
Buck and he is hungry

1747
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:18,144
Ready for it so you would probably go along with it

1748
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
More of the Hague

1749
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,448
Old

1750
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,800
I've seen David Knight in a while I watched a little bit of him accidentally

1751
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,616
Hour-and-a-half through the show or so maybe 2 hours

1752
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:32,480
So David Knight fills in for the rest of the show

1753
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,272
Looks good

1754
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:38,624
Great looks good

1755
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,976
You better look terrible as I go sort of pudgy older man

1756
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,024
Probably a good 20 25 lb

1757
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,608
I hate to say it but they denied

1758
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Griezmann

1759
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
I don't hate it

1760
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,568
I'm happy you're healthy

1761
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
Can you imagine if Alex potato soup

1762
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:07,040
Oh man Alex wearing a suit to work everyday that would be tough to handle

1763
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,088
Batman wears a blazer

1764
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,368
Usually but the top button

1765
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Button up shirt

1766
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:17,280
Super male vitality

1767
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,840
Alex Jones

1768
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,168
Text Cliff

1769
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,448
Back

1770
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
What's the time

1771
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,032
In order to create a business

1772
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Is going on

1773
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,760
I've always said I'm going to solder 10% until they would win

1774
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,904
That's near the end of the fourth quarter and you get

1775
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:52,096
You're already so exhausted

1776
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
Alright

1777
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,264
To disrupt

1778
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
That's what I'm here for

1779
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
But you read the danger of that

1780
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:17,952
Did all of us speak

1781
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
Globalist

1782
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,984
Weekend

1783
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:39,712
Kind of

1784
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,696
Connecticut

1785
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
Lost in thoughts

1786
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,072
Completely different subject

1787
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,680
Anyone telling anybody about Infowars ain't at a library

1788
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,984
So you can just stop

1789
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,312
A black tail people at a library

1790
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,592
Is not going to work

1791
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:11,456
Go from stopping traffic to tell people in the library

1792
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
That is indicative of a huge

1793
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:19,392
Is it like earlier the show I told you why the idea

1794
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,208
What Alex

1795
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,768
A sort of himself

1796
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,072
What I'm here to do is disrupt them

1797
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
That's

1798
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,168
And I think that if we really take a step back

1799
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
And look at

1800
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,984
The bigger picture of what

1801
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,056
They're all con men

1802
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:37,824
Certainly

1803
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,640
All the people that we talked about

1804
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,432
Is less

1805
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,712
On this tip

1806
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
But certainly Jim Bakker

1807
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
Alex Jones

1808
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,344
Maybe even more of a kind

1809
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,184
Much better resume

1810
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,584
Not it's not as big as that one horrible monsters woman that he had on there

1811
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,912
Paula Cain

1812
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
She's the premier conman so far that we've had on our this conversation

1813
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
Perfectly

1814
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
Because

1815
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,152
I think that even beyond the con

1816
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,944
Is what we talked about

1817
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Create a note

1818
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,272
Breakdown

1819
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,552
That's the car

1820
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,856
These people are running but even beyond that

1821
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,648
With their primary function

1822
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
For someone else

1823
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
Like someone else

1824
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
Invest in them

1825
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,304
But I don't think anyone's invested

1826
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
Terry Testa

1827
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,656
The reader

1828
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Them

1829
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,984
Money is because what

1830
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:39,520
The primary

1831
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
Is to normalize

1832
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,128
Ideas that we have already decided

1833
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,920
That's true they

1834
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
Create a scenario in a situation where

1835
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
Alex

1836
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
Get on air

1837
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,344
Yeah f*** yeah I'm afraid of Muslims

1838
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
Amen

1839
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
Then what

1840
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
Yeah

1841
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,232
The public sphere as an acceptable thing to say

1842
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:02,560
Overton window

1843
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,352
To some extent I think it

1844
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,144
I think that there is I don't

1845
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,960
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I think

1846
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
That is

1847
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
The entire game that's

1848
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
Played

1849
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:15,360
That was the goal all along

1850
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
You look at what these

1851
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,176
People have done

1852
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
And you look at their careers over

1853
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Time

1854
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,040
They're deeply invested

1855
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,064
Isn't that sort of thing

1856
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
Like the idea that Mike cernovich

1857
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
Text from

1858
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,184
Gamergate guy pickup artist

1859
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
Community guy

1860
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
Jumped over to

1861
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,024
And then ended up

1862
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
Alex Jones

1863
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
Disciple

1864
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,632
Kind of characters

1865
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,824
But the things that we're going on in those different

1866
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
Segments of his wife

1867
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,688
The only real thing that connects all of them is making

1868
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,248
Really f***** up things not as f***** up

1869
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,808
Accusations

1870
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:59,904
The pizzagate saying that your enemies are pedophile demons

1871
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,464
That's true gamergate

1872
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
Making threats

1873
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,280
Doxxing that's

1874
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Just a part of

1875
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
The normal

1876
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,912
The cautionary things you have to deal with online

1877
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,704
And then with Alex

1878
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
He's playing

1879
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:20,896
Escalation in that just from gamergate was about

1880
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
Route a

1881
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
Just a just a

1882
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,064
All the way to James Gunn getting fired

1883
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
You know like

1884
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,136
There's there's definitely

1885
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,952
That's definitely become part of the / Overton

1886
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,488
For sure

1887
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
Perfect

1888
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
Bike path

1889
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,912
Anything like

1890
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,752
Deal with the most

1891
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,848
Social media is so awful

1892
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
Because

1893
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
A lot of those things

1894
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
Things are so normal

1895
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,248
Like

1896
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,064
Ideas that are being said in August of

1897
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
2018

1898
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,136
5 years ago would have been

1899
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,952
The f*** out of here

1900
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:11,328
You're absolutely right

1901
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,144
45% of Republicans want Trump

1902
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,960
To be able to just close down media Outlets

1903
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
You have to take

1904
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:25,408
Guys like Alex Jones insisting that you can't trust anybody in the mainstream

1905
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
These people

1906
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,528
Their years of backstory

1907
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,184
Abusing immigrants

1908
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
Sort of policy

1909
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,232
All of which is

1910
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
Fine and you can't even

1911
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
And

1912
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,424
You are still offended when somebody calls you erase

1913
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
Even though

1914
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
Your guy is

1915
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,008
Putting together whitener

1916
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
Yeah so I think of that

1917
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
To me is the best sex

1918
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Because I

1919
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,992
What I said many time

1920
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296
This world doesn't have

1921
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,576
Someone else like our

1922
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,392
Like I know the pains up so much

1923
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:14,304
But he is a talented guy with his heads in the right place

1924
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
100 different distraction

1925
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
He's really

1926
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Good

1927
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
At being a propaganda

1928
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Yeah

1929
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
Charismatic

1930
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,312
Kind of funny from now and now and ask

1931
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
He's the meme machine

1932
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,432
But there isn't anyone else

1933
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,968
Like Pacific

1934
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,760
Absolutely.

1935
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:40,160
Can't even f****** handle Alaska can't handle that

1936
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
Todd can't handle that

1937
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:45,280
Evnroll

1938
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,096
Right Rogan isn't that like he is

1939
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,656
He is a big part of normalizing a lot of these

1940
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
These these things

1941
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
Yeah

1942
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,264
He also is somewhat

1943
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
He's not

1944
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,384
Toe the line

1945
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,176
Not verleye

1946
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
Exactly

1947
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,248
He

1948
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,320
He is willing

1949
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
To just like

1950
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:12,160
Drop it all and go Toad and you know like

1951
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,816
This is what I'm going to say because this is part of what we're supposed to do

1952
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,096
That onyx

1953
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,656
Pushpak

1954
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
UB that line

1955
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,824
Now it's time

1956
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
We've been

1957
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,992
He still deserves a lot of criticism

1958
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,040
For having these people I can't Peter Schiff on

1959
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
Is crazy

1960
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
He had

1961
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:45,184
Recent Dave Rubin

1962
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Candace Owens

1963
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
And both times

1964
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
He asked them

1965
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
Like real pointed

1966
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,816
Questions that they could

1967
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
Couldn't answer

1968
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,888
Really embarrassing videos

1969
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,424
Like to the point

1970
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,984
Ruben we're both on his show

1971
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,520
Not able to

1972
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
Foundational

1973
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,080
About what they

1974
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
Just walked

1975
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
F***** up

1976
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,112
I'm so Joe Rogan is kind of an unwitting accomplice

1977
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,648
I think

1978
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,696
Because if he was awaiting accomplice

1979
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
He could be doing

1980
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
So much

1981
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
Right

1982
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,840
Who is Candace Owens

1983
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
Candace Owens

1984
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:28,704
Turning Point USA

1985
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,984
She works at Charlie Kirk

1986
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:36,640
You probably don't know who he is that's right

1987
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
That's how she Rose

1988
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
Prominent

1989
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,528
Before that she was a celebrity

1990
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,368
The the alt-right community under the name red pill black

1991
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,416
And

1992
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,952
What her

1993
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,744
Beginning story

1994
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,768
Was about

1995
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
She was a liberal

1996
01:41:55,584 --> 01:42:00,960
And she was posting some

1997
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Chi-Chi's

1998
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
Be good on her feet

1999
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,128
Generally in

2000
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
She has okay like

2001
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
Camera presence

2002
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
Question

2003
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:22,720
Too hard to not really all that great

2004
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,584
Liberal comedian

2005
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,168
He works for the little while

2006
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:34,240
Probably tired I have no idea

2007
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
But now he's

2008
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
Become

2009
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,056
Conservative comedian

2010
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:40,896
I got he's a YouTuber called the Rubin report

2011
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,944
Disaster

2012
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,528
In terms of like stuff we would want to cover

2013
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
Because he also

2014
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,088
In the same way that

2015
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,904
I don't want to talk about like Bill Maher

2016
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Even though I hate him

2017
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:56,256
I still give Dave Rubin a little bit of like

2018
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,816
Decorative Benefield

2019
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
And I don't want to sit here and read litigate your

2020
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
Joke

2021
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,776
So Candace Owens was making

2022
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
Videos

2023
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Also

2024
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,128
Nope

2025
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,664
I got my timeline

2026
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,480
She was running a company

2027
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:17,760
Start a company

2028
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,296
Believers on Kickstarter

2029
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,136
A companies that would

2030
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,952
Would lead into dachshund

2031
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,024
Aware you would be able to find out the p

2032
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,816
People who are harassing you

2033
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
I don't remember the name of

2034
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,936
But she was

2035
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,264
Anthozoa

2036
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,544
Send her a message

2037
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,104
Yeah that was too effective like

2038
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
Don't do that

2039
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,688
This is the worst idea

2040
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,968
Could possibly

2041
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,504
This will only get

2042
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,528
Get people to attack

2043
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,344
I don't understand

2044
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,392
Well it sounds admirable is

2045
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
The sort of thing

2046
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,184
That will

2047
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:00,000
Wheatley blow up on these online to me right

2048
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:06,400
And they will go after you super hard with no knowledge of who she is or

2049
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,704
She went ahead with it

2050
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,800
And then it blew up in her face exactly the way Zoe Nixon said it would

2051
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,408
I can find her with Cynthia

2052
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,992
And then to make matters even worse

2053
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,016
Candace Owens

2054
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,296
Relieved

2055
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,064
With no

2056
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,368
That she's ever given publicly

2057
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,392
She believes

2058
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,672
Zoe Quinn

2059
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:34,304
I need a potato chili clamor

2060
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,608
Where the one in Six Flags

2061
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:41,728
Genuinely and artfully saying we want to

2062
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,752
Protect you

2063
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,336
Man she is stupid I've read a bunch

2064
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:52,224
I've read a bunch about both sides of exchange the other side

2065
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,552
And there's really no way to look at it reason

2066
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Knox

2067
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
Is

2068
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,160
Laming opport

2069
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Yeah like

2070
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,208
It is

2071
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,560
Absolutely no sense

2072
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,352
What you know of

2073
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:11,680
Essentially shook it off

2074
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
As being like you know what

2075
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:21,152
This is the world that I'm going to make money from so I have to accept that people are going to be

2076
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,944
Extremely at Hollister

2077
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,504
No I think what happened probably

2078
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,064
Was.

2079
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
Time

2080
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,136
She probably got approached

2081
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:32,928
Maybe

2082
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,720
Maybe she started getting attacked

2083
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,000
By the

2084
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Please troll Folk

2085
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,840
Don't like the idea of a business

2086
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,400
Get in the way of their trolling in

2087
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,192
And I think

2088
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Even Docs

2089
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,496
People who are

2090
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,824
You know monsters online

2091
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,616
I still don't think that's the best way to deal with

2092
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,664
Like I think that's still

2093
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,944
Could lead to

2094
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Bass

2095
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,880
Yeah the doctor dangerous you're opening up a can of worms

2096
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:11,072
Rid of bunch of arguments on like the defense of Shame being a powerful tool

2097
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
That kind of stuff

2098
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
And

2099
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:16,704
If you are in a community where you're dealing with people

2100
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,008
I think is a valuable tool

2101
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,824
If you are in an anonymous cute

2102
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
Community

2103
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
Shane blind

2104
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,152
Leaving to

2105
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,432
F****** horrific

2106
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
Justin

2107
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
Stripped Away

2108
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Thursday

2109
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,952
Equinox

2110
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,792
Probably someone approached

2111
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,584
I was like hey you know what

2112
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,728
That's only a theory but like

2113
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,752
I don't know

2114
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,288
From that point on

2115
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,824
She became a figure

2116
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,920
Sort of a black

2117
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:02,272
Supporter

2118
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,856
Yeah absolutely amen she posted a bunch of dumb videos

2119
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,928
And maybe some of them aren't that dumb I've only watched a few and I could

2120
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,840
Mnui Kanye West was like I like the way she

2121
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,376
She thinks

2122
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,192
Sutter

2123
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,776
We got to get out she's an above-average conservative

2124
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,056
Is based on

2125
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
Demographic

2126
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:34,784
I said it essentially the same

2127
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
She's a huge cat

2128
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:39,392
The man somehow demographic utility

2129
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
Is a really

2130
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:47,328
Heart does good stuff

2131
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
Talk about

2132
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:54,496
Fridge conservative they have to go through

2133
01:47:54,752 --> 01:48:00,896
Well shofar

2134
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,760
Big-time white sprout

2135
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:18,048
Somebody everywhere

2136
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:21,888
That is the

2137
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,944
Is shadowbanned

2138
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,480
3%

2139
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,272
That's unfortunate

2140
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Because

2141
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,856
You did put up a

2142
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,256
Enough sites

2143
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,792
Shadow Banning

2144
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:56,192
With a

2145
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,008
The headlines

2146
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,312
Eliminated 90%

2147
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,128
2 top conservative websites

2148
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
Teen election

2149
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,832
2017 Harvard in Columbia journalism review found that the Gateway pundit was 1/4

2150
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,880
Most influential conservative news source

2151
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:21,024
Because of this we were targeted in the scene are numbers related to Facebook and Twitter declined dramatically

2152
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,584
And every single Facebook category our numbers are down

2153
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,888
And Paige visits our numbers were Skyrocket

2154
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,656
Before the election

2155
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,472
Then in three numbers were cut off

2156
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:34,080
That had nothing to do with the quality of our posts as we have proof that are generic

2157
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:40,224
It off tickets go categories provided to us by Facebook our current numbers are below their linear projection

2158
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,504
Of what we should be

2159
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:44,832
In February Facebook launched another algorithm change their platform

2160
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,648
With these changes with our traffic

2161
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,928
We weren't the only ones affected

2162
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,744
The algorithmic change caused President Donald Trump

2163
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,024
Engagement on Facebook post

2164
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,816
Plummeted whopping 45%

2165
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
In contrast

2166
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,520
Senator Elizabeth Warren has suffered a copper bowl

2167
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,568
Decline in Facebook engagement

2168
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,104
Unfortunate

2169
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
Around

2170
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:14,272
Facebook purchase accountant box

2171
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:21,440
The idea that you're getting less traffic is probably because of less automated activity on those social media

2172
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:25,024
What you're doing is basically putting out a study where you own your

2173
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,584
Yourself a little bit you play yourself out

2174
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,888
Because if like legitimately

2175
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,192
If there was a 90

2176
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472
3% drop

2177
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
In there traffic

2178
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,520
Coming from

2179
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,824
Coming from Facebook

2180
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,592
Open Twitter

2181
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,872
What you would hear

2182
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
Is

2183
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:43,456
Unbelievable outcry

2184
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,760
People that were looking for it

2185
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
And isn't there

2186
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:52,416
Like 93% of the people who previously were all about Gateway pundit

2187
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,184
Now

2188
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Nope

2189
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
Way pundit

2190
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
It would be

2191
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,280
Crazy hair

2192
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,072
Now these people complaining

2193
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,376
Don't get me wrong

2194
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,168
Certainly not proportion

2195
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,960
93%

2196
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,008
Has now been cut off

2197
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,592
Did the audience isn't concerned about it

2198
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,384
You are everything

2199
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
You know it's because

2200
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
Cuz that was fake

2201
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,808
AutoZone L on this I know it because of that image

2202
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,136
Is a study

2203
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,440
The Gateway pundit did follow the traffic

2204
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,464
Chick from Facebook

2205
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:30,816
Four numbers website awful ones like Breitbart Daily Caller and Gateway pundit

2206
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,376
As well as something that you've never heard of like one called

2207
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,144
A hundred percent

2208
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,240
Never heard of that and the only thing that the study shows

2209
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,032
Is that they have dropped

2210
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,056
Considerably

2211
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,336
In Facebook engagement

2212
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,640
Now if that's true and we trust

2213
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,664
These stats

2214
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,432
They're not

2215
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:49,248
Necessarily authenticating but siding

2216
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,296
They put the numbers

2217
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,624
Interceptor all go ahead

2218
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,184
You know old stipulate that those numbers are true

2219
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:00,000
I would say if you guys had a real good run

2220
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,048
A weird reason

2221
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:07,680
And I bet your numbers are coming back down to where they should have been based on the quality

2222
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
Hope you're clearly not

2223
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,240
Tru report

2224
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
Ikea

2225
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
That they would have had a

2226
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,408
During the 20

2227
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:24,064
There's just no reason I can think of and there was that

2228
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,880
Are articles it's very clearly pointed out the

2229
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:30,976
Sharp uptick in traffic to Breitbart and then Sharp

2230
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,000
Drop

2231
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:34,048
Almost to the exact same point

2232
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:36,096
As if there was

2233
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
Fake engagement

2234
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,424
And you have

2235
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,960
Who was who would want to do that

2236
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,728
I don't know

2237
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,080
With the resources and the know-how

2238
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,920
Influence

2239
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,712
Who knows

2240
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:55,552
I guess total mystery

2241
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,856
Completely

2242
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,904
Blindsided by this information

2243
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,952
Speaking of total Mysteries

2244
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,512
We now get to again

2245
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,144
Store Media Matters for

2246
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,216
I would like either of them

2247
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
To have

2248
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,312
We problematic

2249
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,616
Most like them

2250
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
To bring up

2251
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,408
This interview

2252
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:25,760
This is a guy we have not necessarily seen before on Ark

2253
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:32,160
Understanding the threat

2254
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,696
The nation

2255
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:38,560
Winterizing the tailed assessment

2256
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,888
Counterinsurgency strategy

2257
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,728
Oh that's not good

2258
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:59,040
That's the only website that allows you to find out where Muslims live and

2259
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:02,368
Show up at their house and f*** them up wheeler alert he also trains

2260
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,904
Cops

2261
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,208
Notably

2262
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,488
Maricopa

2263
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:10,304
County cops

2264
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,680
Why isn't he

2265
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:19,008
Well I don't know I don't know

2266
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,544
So he sucks

2267
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
Already we just know that from

2268
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:27,200
We know that from Alex's intro

2269
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,224
Maricopa County

2270
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:32,576
Bankrate

2271
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:43,072
True

2272
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:43,840
Few things and then

2273
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:46,144
His life's work

2274
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:49,728
What I think the problem is the biggest threat Alex

2275
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,496
Izzat

2276
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,288
And I don't mean you and me

2277
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,336
Find me an hour leadership

2278
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,360
That has

2279
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,384
Forgotten

2280
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:00,736
And been criminally negligent and I wish you'd stop there

2281
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,344
I couldn't we could have a Baseline

2282
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,112
Of like

2283
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:11,488
Yeah yeah yeah

2284
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,048
In defending their owners of office

2285
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
Which is a

2286
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,352
Legally binding

2287
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,448
Understand who we are I think

2288
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:22,496
If our leaders understand who we are

2289
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,800
And what the underpinnings of the Republic

2290
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:27,616
Then when the marches and the Communist in the Socialist

2291
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:29,152
Any Islamic movement

2292
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
The jihadis

2293
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,456
Come along

2294
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:33,760
We we easily

2295
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:39,392
Shrug them off as being absurd and we won't let him in our society have any play

2296
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,672
Okay

2297
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,488
Bad

2298
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,512
Not great

2299
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Negative

2300
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,144
Output

2301
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,216
Column

2302
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:56,800
-4

2303
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
Cuz you have no idea

2304
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,760
John Gandolfo

2305
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,552
I don't know

2306
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:13,952
Is FBI background to lend himself credibility for his training course it was l a

2307
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:21,632
Civilians alike is the controversial manner in which he depart

2308
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
Did the federal law enforcement

2309
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:30,080
In 2,000 resign from the bureau in disgrace after a number of ethical breaches in business

2310
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
Contact

2311
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:34,432
Including admitting to having affairs with female FBI agents

2312
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:38,272
And confidential Source he was assigned to protect during the corruption case

2313
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:42,112
A former US rep William Jefferson Democrat from Louisiana

2314
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:46,208
He also solicited that witness for a 75,000 donation

2315
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:50,816
That's not good

2316
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
From an article in the New Orleans time

2317
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:53,888
Picayune

2318
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:59,776
According to court documents unsealed last week the FBI and it's office of professional responsibility

2319
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:06,176
As far back as December that the relationship with a confidential

2320
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,480
He thought could damage the investigation

2321
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,272
But they never passed it in

2322
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,832
Information to the US attorney's office Prosecuting Jefferson

2323
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:15,392
Who was the lead FBI agent in the investigation

2324
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:20,256
This is just unbelievable said George Washington University law professor Jonathan

2325
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:25,632
Is the FBI was aware that an agent

2326
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,656
Improper relationship

2327
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,680
The confidential source

2328
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:30,496
Should have been disclosed to the court

2329
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:35,616
It's very disturbing said Harvey silverglate a Boston lawyer and author of recent book

2330
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,664
Critical of federal law enforcement

2331
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,248
First of all should be having an affair with the government

2332
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
Informant

2333
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:48,416
If it does happen course it must be disclosed because it because it could affect the credit

2334
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:52,256
Ability

2335
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
Yep.

2336
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:58,912
Mod that's the informant that he was playing around with

2337
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,960
I included in the unskilled document

2338
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,776
She said she gone do engaged

2339
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,312
Mild intimacy

2340
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,616
In New Orleans in April 2005

2341
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:14,528
Occasions Gondola McCook in propria sexual advances in a car

2342
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,832
A townhouse and her parents home

2343
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:20,672
On one occasion she said he was overly aggressive

2344
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,208
But she fended him off

2345
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:27,840
Once or twice then between April and May 2005

2346
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,376
From there

2347
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,936
He resigned from the FBI in disgrace

2348
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,240
I began inciting hatred and fear of Muslim

2349
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:37,824
From a lateral move

2350
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
Help

2351
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:42,432
From a 2012 article in the Associated Press

2352
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:46,784
Virginia-based

2353
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:50,880
My group is leading the training being held this week at the World Outreach Church

2354

Murfreesboro

2355
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:56,000
During a conference

2356
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,048
Controller said that local mosques

2357

Front organization

2358
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,608
Thanks for the Muslim Brotherhood

2359
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,888
They do not

2360
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:04,192
Have a First Amendment right to do any

2361
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,728
Cordello's said then

2362
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:10,592
He did not return a message from the Associated Press seeking comment in time for the store

2363
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,920
Muslims are never First Amendment

2364
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,784
These people who love the

2365
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,904
In March 2018 Southwest Airlines

2366
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,696
Condemned John Gunn.

2367
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,256
A former FBI agent

2368
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,864
Getting his Arizona law enforcement agencies and controversy

2369
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:37,216
They they called him what he did

2370
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,752
Inappropriate

2371
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,032
Target

2372
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Unemployed

At the airport as he traveled

Western conservative conference

2377
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,040
I wish this were shocking

2378
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:54,368
A Sharia adherent Muslim on my my plane

2379
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,184
He wrote adding the hashtag quote Sharia kill

2380
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,720
Suggest like I

2381
01:59:59,232 --> 01:59:59,744
Just like a person

2382
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:04,608
Yeah just a random dude

2383
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,448
It is a deep history of June this year

2384
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,288
In September 2017 poster pictures he took of to TSA employees

2385
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,360
Just based on the fact that they looked Arabic

2386
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,152
With the caption quotes

2387
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:20,736
Am I the only person who sees a problem with terrorist protecting us

2388
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,784
Nothing like

2389
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:27,136
LaGuardia Airport TSA uniform

2390
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,976
What a f****** pile of s***

2391
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,096
Can't put my finger on it

2392
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,168
What a monster it's almost like

2393
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,960
Judges people

2394
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
Like there

2395
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
Content

2396
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,640
Instead

2397
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:49,920
The color of theirs

2398
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
Right

2399
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,480
I agree

2400
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:54,528
So we had we have a guy

2401
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,808
Who's going around

2402
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:58,368
Touting his FBI credentials in order to

2403
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,136
Do these

2404
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:01,184
Anti-muslim law enforcement

2405
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,464
Anything

2406
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,488
We really just

2407
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,512
Heap book

2408
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,304
But it's not about some sort of

2409
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,120
Fear of radical Jihad or anything like that

2410
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:13,728
Get triggered by the idea that anybody who might be of Arabic heritage

2411
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,520
Is working at an airport

2412
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,848
Taking pictures of people

2413
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,920
It's not like those people were like

2414
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:24,480
Conversation

2415
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:28,320
No talk to them

2416
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:31,904
Muslims aren't there clearly pictures that were taken without these peoples

2417
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,464
Camera

2418
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:36,000
Probably

2419
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,048
It's crazy like this guy is a

2420
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
Dick Alex is having him on the show.

2421
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:40,864
Talk about these

2422
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Threat

2423
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,960
Like socialism and Islam in America

2424
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,336
What

2425
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,872
The movie crime

2426
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:52,896
Right

2427
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:59,296
To anonymously and then posts

2428
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,880
Blessed weekend

2429
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:05,440
That's true professional problem

2430
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
With what

2431
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,488
He does it clearly

2432
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,536
It's not based on actual

2433
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,304
Evidence

2434
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,072
Based on hatred

2435
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:16,192
While he was

2436
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:19,264
Working for the FBI that almost jeopardized

2437
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,568
Investigation

2438
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:27,968
That's grounds for a mistrial right there

2439
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:31,296
No because what we just talked about earlier

2440
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:34,880
Yeah I know but you should be that should be then like a

2441
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:38,464
And they're like

2442
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:42,560
We're going to either invalidate this thing or read

2443
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,120
Cuz our justice system is great

2444
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
The case was

2445
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
Successful

2446
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,192
Against

2447
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,216
What was that guy's name

2448
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,752
William Jeff

2449
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,032
Person represented

2450
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,312
The corruption case

2451
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:57,664
And when they try to appeal it on the grounds that they didn't disclose at the

2452
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:05,088
Immediately

2453
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:05,856
Stocked up

2454
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,928
Like I think I think that it's probably

2455
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:09,696
Fair

2456
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:12,256
That they decided not to rehear the case

2457
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,048
Because it was not

2458
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,840
Necessarily substantiv

2459
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:16,864
The case itself

2460
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:21,216
Of Korat behavior on the part of an agent and that's why he had to

2461
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:24,800
F****** hit the brick

2462
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,592
But like a

2463
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,384
In terms of the actual case

2464
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
All he was doing

2465
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:32,480
Was driving her to meet with him

2466
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,016
And posing as

2467
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:34,784
The driver

2468
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,368
So their relationship wouldn't have actually

2469
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,904
It wouldn't have changed

2470
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
The outcome of

2471
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:46,560
The information that was gathered by her wearing a wire talk to him

2472
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:49,120
I understand why the appeal would be unsuccessful

2473
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,400
But it is

2474
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,192
The epitome of

2475
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,984
Unethical Behavior

2476
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
Ask

2477
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,312
Coming of someone who

2478
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,336
We hope

2479
02:03:58,592 --> 02:03:59,872
Would be in that position

2480
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,152
What is a

2481
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:04,480
They still killed Fred Hampton they murdered him

2482
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,784
Right

2483
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,552
Just f*** Fred Hamm

2484
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,088
That would be great

2485
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:14,208
Probably the worst

2486
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,000
Song is this

2487
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,024
You know what I'm

2488
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,072
What

2489
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,728
Anyway it's grounds for a

2490
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:28,544
Has but otherwise

2491
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,104
Repackaged

2492
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:37,248
Avis exit we get the last little piece of John gondolas

2493
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,296
And then I have a

2494
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,832
Real harsh criticism

2495
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,368
Of the narrative

2496
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,136
He's putting out there

2497
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:45,440
Talks about all the time

2498
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:47,488
Sort of his Mane

2499
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:49,792
Deeply deeply

2500
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:50,560
Police log

2501
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,632
Millions of people are dead

2502
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,656
From

2503
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,960
Marxist communist socialist movement

2504
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,520
Millions of people have been killed

2505
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,080
By The Sword of Islam

2506
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,384
In the 1400 years that they've existed

2507
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,944
And their Doctrine supports it that's the difference

2508
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:13,600
Neighbors

2509
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,648
Neighbors neighbors

2510
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
So Jordan

2511
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:20,256
Alex and his guests have brass balls compared to deaths

2512
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,024
Socialism

2513
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:21,792
Marxism

2514
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,608
Consider the statistics

2515
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:29,728
Ignoring the number of deaths you can easily associate

2516
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,776
As a direct result of capitalism

2517
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:34,848
Or Christianity

2518
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,896
The USA is responsible for between 10

2519
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:41,248
15 million deaths in Vietnam Korean and Iraq Wars that we had

2520
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,296
Very subtle proxy wars in Pakistan

2521
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:47,648
Other places around the world

2522
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,976
So just was pointless Wars that we've been intimate

2523
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:52,256
World War

2524
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,280
Between night

2525
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,816
29 million deaths

2526
02:05:56,608 --> 02:06:01,216
Children die every day because of the direct consequences

2527
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,008
8 million

2528
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,056
Thirty thousand a year

2529
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:08,896
Consider the idea that there was a very robust Native American population

2530
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,944
In America

2531
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,992
Consider the

2532
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:15,552
Entire slave trade after all look the more capitalistic

2533
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,136
Then let's talk about Christianity

2534
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:25,024
34-in Archbishop of Bremen ordered the slaughter of a group of

2535
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,048
Setting

2536
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,888
Leaving to between 5,000 and 11000

2537
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,936
They were there because they were

2538
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:35,264
Intersection of Christianity

2539
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,800
Capital

2540
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:48,576
Jesus said that directly you know what he was all about

2541
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,112
Money for the church

2542
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:58,560
Catholic Church killed about twenty thousand people in The albigensian Crusade which they launched because they didn't like

2543
02:06:58,816 --> 02:06:59,840
Cow the cathars had

2544
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:07,008
The cathars in 1209

2545
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:09,824
I would have difficulty telling the difference between the cathars

2546
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,896
So the app

2547
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:17,760
Kill them all the Lord will the Lord will recognize his own

2548
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:21,344
Then there's the other Crusades all the inquisition's all centuries

2549
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,880
Witch hunting slash burning

2550
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,928
The history of colonialism

2551
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:27,232
Failed missionary Activity The Mysterious look Hibbetts in

2552
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,000
The genocide

2553
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:28,768
Pretty regularly

2554
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:34,144
Top commission Eric's Behavior

2555
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,752
The Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelty

2556
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:40,032
They built a long

2557
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,312
Long enough for the toes

2558
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,080
The touch the ground

2559
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
Repent strangulation

2560
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:45,920
And then hang 13 natives at a time and honor

2561
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:48,224
Of Christ Our Savior of the 12 apostles

2562
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:52,832
Then straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were very burned alive

2563
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,416
Population of Hispaniola was reduced from 400000

2564
02:07:57,952 --> 02:08:01,792
They killed so many natives that they had to begin importing slaves from other Islands

2565
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,120
Quote unless the normal lifetime of a single human being

2566
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:07,680
An entire culture of millions of people

2567
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:10,752
Thousands of year residents at their home

2568
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,544
Had been experimenting

2569
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,432
And I'm going to say

2570
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,456
In fact

2571
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,992
The problem

2572
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,016
Is not religion

2573
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:24,064
No problem

2574
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,856
F******

2575
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,648
It is not

2576
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:34,048
They were the ones

2577
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:39,424
Between Christianity

2578
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,216
And Islam is

2579
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,032
F****** patriarchy

2580
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:46,336
There's a big part of that

2581
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:48,640
Like at the end of the day

2582
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:49,408
F******

2583
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:52,736
Man

2584
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,016
These people are f******

2585
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,296
Apes they're not

2586
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,112
Human beings there they're just a weird like

2587
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:04,512
Mix of all of The evolutionary behavior in the lizard brain and

2588
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,192
Dude that I want

2589
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:12,960
Is that

2590
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:15,008
I don't think

2591
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:19,104
Like communism has killed

2592
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,896
The amount of people that Alex

2593
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,432
Pretends they have probably

2594
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:24,224
Because a lot of it is mismanaged

2595
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:26,272
They always over-inflated statistic

2596
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,064
Text to include like

2597
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,600
We talked about that

2598
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:35,232
No doubt No Doubt

2599
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,768
Unfortunate byproduct of

2600
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,536
Miss manage

2601
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:43,424
They also

2602
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,192
Because of me

2603
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,216
Natural trends

2604
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:45,984
What happened

2605
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,008
On the ground

2606
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,800
The idea of

2607
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,104
You know 22,000

2608
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,152
Children die every day

2609
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:53,920
Because of

2610
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,944
Like Direct

2611
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,224
Poverty causes

2612
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:58,528
That is being done

2613
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,808
By capitalism

2614
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:03,648
Like that is a direct result of it is the violin

2615
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:05,952
End of what capitalism.

2616
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,280
The thing that you don't want to look at

2617
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,120
I don't think that I don't think

2618
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:14,144
Christianity

2619
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,448
Islam is responsible for the other death

2620
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
Either I think it's

2621
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,752
Like you say it's dude

2622
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,288
Evil dudes

2623
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:22,080
Use a system in order to in

2624
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,104
Powers are evil

2625
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,664
Yep

2626
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,200
Now this is really its fault

2627
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
East Capitol

2628
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:30,272
Because

2629
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,088
Greed

2630
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:38,208
I mean

2631
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:39,488
Yeah absolutely

2632
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,048
No I think at the end of the day

2633
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:42,816
What were say

2634
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:47,936
Is that we should all go to Seattle and murdered

2635
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,472
It's not what we are all saying

2636
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:51,520
Again

2637
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:53,056
A real dude

2638
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,336
Go to bed

2639
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,640
For like 20 years

2640
02:10:56,896 --> 02:11:00,736
Go to bed

2641
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:07,136
You get out of here for a while

2642
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:08,416
But it'll be too late

2643
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:11,488
I love

2644
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:17,888
Learning about his history

2645
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:18,912
No problem

2646
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,728
I ended up

2647
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:24,544
Running out of time because I was like oh my God

2648
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:25,824
Capitalism

2649
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,592
Christianity

2650
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:29,408
Responsible

2651
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:31,200
Very f*****-up over the

2652
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:33,248
The years that Alex doesn't want to talk about

2653
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,296
Almost ended up

2654
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,088
Like we would have talked about that for now

2655
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:43,744
Just because I would have been like

2656
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,024
We can get off that

2657
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,816
John gondolas gone now

2658
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,584
And now

2659
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:49,376
We come to the end of Alex's

2660
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:51,680
Cuz I like I said David lights

2661
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:52,704
For the end of the show

2662
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:55,264
Getting out early

2663
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:59,360
When I said earlier in the show that we're doing

2664
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,408
Did Alex is fake

2665
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,432
Is in his own hands

2666
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,736
Victims inspire

2667
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,296
Like I don't think

2668
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:09,856
You don't think he's got this

2669
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,904
This is what

2670
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,696
Coming

2671
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,768
On the day that he gets

2672
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,304
Kicked off everything no I don't think

2673
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,072
This is good

2674
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:23,424
Globalist

2675
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:52,352
But I don't like Hollywood

2676
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:55,424
Carsponsors

2677
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:58,240
Your sponsor

2678
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,408
But they got a price

2679
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,224
That is a price Barbarian

2680
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,016
What's the price

2681
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,576
Advocate all truth

2682
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:18,208
Instruments of racketeering

2683
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:27,680
Only then will you be

2684
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:30,496
But even in terms of time he's done that exact

2685
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:33,824
Same thing in the past

2686
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,200
You got I got bored I got zoned out a little bit

2687
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:41,760
I kept thinking about how maybe it's

2688
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
Because of cake that he

2689
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,208
Me that I wanted to live

2690
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,448
Where are unlike any other band

2691
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:05,568
Much better

2692
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,848
Not really

2693
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:14,784
Cake is better than all those bands or anything like that but I don't see any other

2694
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:18,368
Around that time when I was at 8

2695
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:21,952
The same way

2696
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:22,976
I think cake was

2697
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,000
Very unique

2698
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,280
Not like

2699
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,816
The distance necessarily

2700
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:29,632
That's not my the right where I live

2701
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:31,936
I love like a commissioning a sin

2702
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:38,336
Symphony in C

2703
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,896
Not necessarily of their sound but like what

2704
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,664
Makes them

2705
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:48,064
Weird what makes the really great the opposite of

2706
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,088
From there

2707
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:52,416
Quotes no no no no

2708
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:54,976
For Honor

2709
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,256
What made that song

2710
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,792
Great.

2711
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:00,096
In the other songs like this

2712
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:01,376
Or I will survive

2713
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:06,240
What is a better Zone.

2714
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:14,688
Conversation we have about Alex

2715
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,224
Turn to do like a

2716
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:21,344
So here's why this music from the 90s wasn't as good as you

2717
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:26,464
A boring facsimile of Alex doing

2718
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,488
Demon voice

2719
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:29,792
Uninspired

2720
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:30,560
It's not like

2721
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:33,120
There's nothing behind it that we haven't heard

2722
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:33,888
Before

2723
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:34,656
It's like

2724
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:40,544
So I am

2725
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,944
What was the MTV for like forever

2726
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:54,112
S*** now I'm going to lose my mind a Long Jacket

2727
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:58,720
It wasn't

2728
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:01,536
They were a bass driven band

2729
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:05,120
In a world full of guitar-driven

2730
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:08,960
Play pool

2731
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:15,616
I don't like that like that world

2732
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:19,968
Is there train was built around the vocals of that guy because they were so terrible

2733
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:26,368
They're strongly disagree

2734
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,648
Because

2735
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:33,280
I'm telling you right now this will just walk around in circle

2736
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,776
That was why that was what

2737
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:44,544
Anyways

2738
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:47,872
Lineage

2739
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,896
It's based upon.

2740
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:54,016
Getting off the hook

2741
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:58,880
A good that album wasn't that great

2742
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:03,232
Okay so singles

2743
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,328
Soul coughing

2744
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:09,376
I'm telling you this is the greatest show

2745
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:14,752
Single from 1994

2746
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:17,824
Heard that song

2747
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:21,408
Down to this

2748
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:22,688
North

2749
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:24,992
None of these Charter

2750
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:27,552
None of you started except Circle

2751
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:36,512
Baccarat notes very different but but he

2752
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:41,888
New York Louise is listening

2753
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:45,728
Obama's was fine

2754
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:49,824
S*** I used to listen to the track all the time soundtrack

2755
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:50,592
Demaree

2756
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,640
What was it

2757
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:56,992
Now I can't remember I remember listening to this

2758
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,784
And around

2759
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:01,600
Whenever I was driving

2760
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,136
Going to go visit a bunch of colleges

2761
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:04,672
There is this song

2762
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:06,464
Wherein they talk about

2763
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,048
What

2764
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:16,448
What's the name of the I think you're probably trying to come up with

2765
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:23,872
What is no more parties in LA

2766
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:27,456
Kendrick Lamar

2767
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,992
What's the name of it

2768
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:32,832
How many lose my life

2769
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,624
Will lose my goddamn mind

2770
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:38,720
The distances

2771
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,768
The best ones

2772
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,304
Sheep go to heaven that was

2773
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,192
Yeah that's about it

2774
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:53,056
Let's talk about it now let's talk about tonic

2775
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
It is

2776
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,712
No it really is

2777
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:02,016
Notice.

2778
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:06,368
But love is surely better when it's gone

2779
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:10,464
S***

2780
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,488
Everybody

2781
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:13,792
People are going to post in the group the song that I've taken

2782
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,584
And it's going to murder me

2783
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,352
I hope it's just

2784
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,376
Talk about how great

2785
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,680
Noah

2786
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:21,472
But I did love that song when I was younger

2787
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:24,288
It's one of those long rambling songs

2788
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:26,848
Is it one of those long rambling songs where the guy talks

2789
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:34,784
It's where he talks about losing my mind anyway

2790
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,064
We got it

2791
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:38,368
We can't do this anymore

2792
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,904
From so

2793
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,440
We're coming to the end of this episode

2794
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:42,208
Yeah

2795
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:43,488
Alex Matos

2796
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:47,072
Is this mouse has done his

2797
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,352
The demon voice

2798
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,656
And now he's going to try

2799
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,216
Mistake

2800
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,752
On people

2801
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:55,520
Not defy

2802
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:58,592
Really weird

2803
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,640
Because they see whatever

2804
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:04,224
Existing

2805
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:07,040
Problem but it's perfect

2806
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:11,904
Overthrow

2807
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:19,840
The internet

2808
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:29,568
Everyone in Street

2809
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:33,920
Socially conformed

2810
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:37,248
What is the token of travel

2811
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,064
I said we want you to

2812
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:44,160
Don't promote Alex Jones

2813
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:45,952
So everyone

2814
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:05,152
What Pole

2815
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:11,296
I mean Alex

2816
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:16,160
Attacking him is the market

2817
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,488
The token of travel

2818
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:28,192
It doesn't help

2819
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:33,312
That's true

2820
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,872
Everybody else with a large platform has

2821
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:36,896
Essentially ignored

2822
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:40,224
Thank you to everyone who does like our show

2823
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,016
The rest of the world

2824
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:42,784
It's not like some

2825
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,320
Magical golden ticket

2826
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:46,368
Willy Wonka Factory of

2827
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:50,976
Search engine optimization hits

2828
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:55,072
So like

2829
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
This is cockamamie

2830
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:58,912
It's one of those things

2831
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,192
I love it

2832
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:01,216
Having to dig

2833
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:02,240
Deep into his bag of

2834
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,008
Trick

2835
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,800
And bring out all of these things

2836
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:07,360
Like he's bringing out the idea that like

2837
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,384
It's the market

2838
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,664
The Beast

2839
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,456
2 attack

2840
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:20,672
Then also the colonel Travis metaphor with remember info

2841
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,976
Stuff just to rationalize like

2842
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:25,024
I got to keep people on board

2843
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,304
What I see here

2844
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
Ice-T

2845
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,192
You know I don't I don't

2846
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,984
I don't I don't know if it's just

2847
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:36,800
My awareness

2848
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:40,384
I see a guy who's been bluffing

2849
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,408
For a long time

2850
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,968
Who like realizes now

2851
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:47,296
Play poker table is

2852
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:48,320
Nicole

2853
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:49,600
Like you realized

2854
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:52,416
October point it didn't look like YouTube

2855
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,184
Facebook

2856
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:54,976
And it didn't look like they had

2857
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:58,048
We're going to play nowhere

2858
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:59,072
The Riverhead

2859
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:00,608
And they made their straight

2860
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,632
Or whatever

2861
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:06,496
I've been using way too many poker now but like that's what's going on

2862
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,264
He's like

2863
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,032
I know I'm going to

2864
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,056
Afford

2865
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,848
But I'm going to sit here and

2866
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:11,872
For a little while

2867
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:14,176
She brings out some of the familiar narrative

2868
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:16,224
He has on his llama photo because

2869
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:18,528
Keep the status quo going

2870
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:19,808
You know it is

2871
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,880
Honestly I wanted him to freak out

2872
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:24,928
That's what I wanted to

2873
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:29,024
That's what it would have been it seems like

2874
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,840
Yeah like I think

2875
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:33,376
You surrendering a little bit

2876
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:35,680
Maybe that's a monkey's paw situation

2877
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:36,448
Is

2878
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,312
And so we have to

2879
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
Scramble to find somebody else

2880
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:48,992
No 2009-2010

2881
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,528
In the present day

2882
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,320
How things got to

2883
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:54,112
You know like I do

2884
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:55,904
I don't think the present

2885
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,696
Day taking down of Alex

2886
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:00,000
Except

2887
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:02,560
It's harder for me to find the ax

2888
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,328
Episodes

2889
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,680
You know like I am through hurdles a little bit in order to find them

2890
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:08,704
But that

2891
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:10,496
Think that's a small issue

2892
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:13,824
Alex Jones disappears tomorrow

2893
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,360
From every single platform

2894
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,896
For whatever it's that happen

2895
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:20,224
We can do this show for a very long time

2896
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:20,992
Right

2897
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,272
Uncovering like

2898
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,088
How did this happen

2899
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:26,368
What are the transformation

2900
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:33,536
Like we could do this year for the next five years is going back through his archives

2901
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:37,120
Interesting history

2902
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,912
Because the present

2903
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,192
He's not that interest

2904
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,216
Even if

2905
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:41,984
Kicked off all of

2906
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,776
These platforms isn't that interesting

2907
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,056
What if we

2908
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:51,712
Exactly

2909
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,808
Very absolutely

2910
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,832
The people are accusing

2911
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:58,880
Strawman argument

2912
02:24:59,392 --> 02:24:59,904
Celtic Defender

2913
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:02,976
It's nothing

2914
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,512
It's not different at all

2915
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:05,792
It's boring

2916
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,656
Either he does or he dies

2917
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,448
I think I'd like I said

2918
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,752
Yeah

2919
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:21,152
Probably I'm really interested

2920
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:24,224
Begone because

2921
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,600
Because he failed to evolve

2922
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,624
Yeah like

2923
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,648
Laughter

2924
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,440
When you are in this game

2925
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:35,488
Pretends he's the best at

2926
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,024
You got a key

2927
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:39,328
Keep swimming got to keep going

2928
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:47,520
Embarrassment

2929
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:49,568
Going along

2930
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,592
Pizzagate man have

2931
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,616
Apologizing

2932
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,944
But if you don't play by that that game

2933
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:55,968
What you end up

2934
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,504
So reserved

2935
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:00,320
That you aren't you have no traction you are

2936
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,600
Cutting Edge you want

2937
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:02,624
You aren't interesting

2938
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,696
The idiots that are your Market

2939
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,488
The problem is he's playing

2940
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:10,304
We're so used to him always playing

2941
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,120
Offense but he's trying to play offensive

2942
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:14,912
Yeah but

2943
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
He's yelling

2944
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,704
Chinese dentist

2945
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:22,080
King-style

2946
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:26,688
To be Rodger Stone

2947
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:29,504
Like the the playoffs

2948
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,320
Book of always attack never defend works

2949
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:35,136
You have been doing that since

2950
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:35,904
Seaward

2951
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,696
Or something like that

2952
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:39,488
High-stakes level

2953
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:41,280
Alex

2954
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:44,608
It's not really had any real pushback

2955
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:46,400
Tell a couple

2956
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:50,240
Like I know that he had people who are like

2957
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:54,080
You're a chance f*** you're a show you're an idiot and yet like that

2958
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:57,408
But it's the same thing with like I get comments on our website

2959
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,176
Think about

2960
02:26:58,688 --> 02:26:59,456
Blogs I wrote

2961
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,480
Stuff like that there like

2962
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:03,552
Soros is a demon you should know that and like

2963
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,464
Fair enough the next

2964
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,232
Existential crisis

2965
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:16,352
Hello anyway and this is how Alex

2966
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,632
Pizza the show

2967
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,424
To go out a little bit dramatic

2968
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:23,264
A little bit longer but

2969
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:24,288
I think

2970
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,104
I left

2971
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:28,128
Okay

2972
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,712
Everybody's fight

2973
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:38,624
My podcast

2974
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:41,952
You do your child

2975
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:48,608
You were transphobic

2976
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,448
We organized the last

2977
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:05,248
Number one most important

2978
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,552
This is about coming after you're free

2979
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,344
This is about the big

2980
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:14,976
And

2981
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,000
I could go for an inch

2982
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:19,328
Your friends your family

2983
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:25,472
Everybody work with

2984
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:31,104
Talk about yourself

2985
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:38,272
American

2986
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,904
What

2987
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,192
The shot everybody else down so

2988
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:57,984
Why don't you be afraid

2989
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:02,336
Infowars.com show

2990
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:06,944
Announcer iPhone ad

2991
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:14,880
I'm probably 15

2992
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:21,536
YouTube Facebook and Twitter probably the next

2993
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:24,096
Everybody else said that yesterday

2994
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:29,216
Why do you see links on the Articles podcast

2995
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:15,040
You're not going to take advantage of the pig

2996
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:18,112
Action Auto

2997
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:19,392
That's how he decides

2998
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:21,696
The M.G.'s time before handing the Baton

2999
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:22,976
To David.

3000
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,256
Do you know what

3001
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,024
I heard

3002
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:30,144
He should probably not bring on a meetings on air

3003
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,936
No

3004
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:32,960
The same

3005
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:35,264
Tone

3006
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:37,568
When we did our lives showing off

3007
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:42,176
That was the same tone as his last episode being broadcast live

3008
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,992
So you're implying

3009
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:47,040
And we don't we don't know this

3010
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:47,808
He knows

3011
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:52,672
You're implying that he knows that there's more to come of his downfall

3012
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,696
Is not

3013
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:58,304
Yet been not having

3014
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:00,608
And we are recording we know that

3015
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:01,632
Is gone

3016
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:08,544
So yeah I mean I don't know I don't know what else in the world can do to

3017
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,104
Cuz it's not like some organizations

3018
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,408
I'm going to be able to take away is short

3019
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,456
Or something like that

3020
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:18,528
There are things that are just intrigued

3021
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:21,344
I will put this out

3022
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,648
And if you will Re-Boost it

3023
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,672
Then yeah

3024
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,696
There is still

3025
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:27,488
Still Market

3026
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:28,256
Access

3027
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,280
But it's

3028
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:31,328
I agree with you though

3029
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:33,376
What I hear is resignation

3030
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,912
Yep I hear

3031
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,448
And I dunno

3032
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,008
The next week

3033
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,544
Maybe it's a bad day

3034
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:44,128
You know maybe the day it had maybe the day it happened

3035
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:45,408
What you expected

3036
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:46,688
Becomes in guns blazing

3037
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:47,456
And he's just like

3038
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:48,992
F****** tired

3039
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:52,576
So maybe it's like a thing where he shows up

3040
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,344
To work is like

3041
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,464
To get with

3042
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,744
Writer's room

3043
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:05,120
Come up with like a Rodger Rodger tell me what to do

3044
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:11,008
As part of the coverage of the manafort trial they had a picture of manafort

3045
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:12,032
Fan Rogers

3046
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:13,056
Stone and

3047
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:14,336
Some other assholes

3048
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:16,640
Probably

3049
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:17,664
I'd like the 7th

3050
02:32:18,688 --> 02:32:19,712
God Rodger Stone looks

3051
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:20,736
Like a

3052
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:21,760
F****** rat

3053
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:25,088
Sane

3054
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,976
Bring me Rodger Stone documentary

3055
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:35,840
Because

3056
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:40,704
Propaganda thru-and-thru is anything

3057
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,240
Interesting

3058
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,312
Because the town that they were setting up

3059
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,080
Turn this off

3060
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:46,848
Way to fry

3061
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:51,200
As much as I Rodger Stone

3062
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:55,808
Loki Behavior to be

3063
02:32:56,064 --> 02:33:01,440
Loki was described

3064
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:04,256
The show Neil Gaiman

3065
02:33:04,512 --> 02:33:05,024
You're listening

3066
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:06,560
Justice

3067
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,144
Cuz he was mentioned.

3068
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:14,496
I don't want

3069
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:23,200
Information that's what you can turn it off

3070
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,512
Honestly think that we said most of what we feel and most of what we need to say about

3071
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:39,328
This episode The 86

3072
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,912
He's fixing episode of Alex Jones 86 on 86

3073
02:33:43,168 --> 02:33:45,728
Now that it's not bad even though we set it at

3074
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:48,544
Couple times it's still has a real great

3075
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,616
I don't know what the future will bring

3076
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,408
I don't pretend to

3077
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,712
Even as someone who studies in my town

3078
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:56,992
I can't predict

3079
02:33:57,248 --> 02:33:57,760
The future

3080
02:33:58,272 --> 02:34:00,576
I can and I think you have also felt

3081
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:01,600
Weakness

3082
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:04,416
I'm like we said

3083
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:07,232
Maybe it's a maybe it's a momentary lapse

3084
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:09,024
Swinging harder than ever

3085
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,816
I think it's probably in Plaza

3086
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,608
But

3087
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:14,144
I don't know

3088
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,192
Really matters

3089
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:16,960
Because

3090
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:20,800
What Alex Jones and body is it still just as dangerous even if he's

3091
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:21,568
Not on

3092
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:23,616
Facebook even if he's not on YouTube

3093
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:24,896
The reach

3094
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,688
Is diminished

3095
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:29,248
The people who are being abused by him

3096
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:32,320
Are still being hurt by

3097
02:34:32,832 --> 02:34:34,368
Yeah those people are still there

3098
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,392
People are going to

3099
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:36,672
Become more radical

3100
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:39,744
Because they feel that these orders action

3101
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:41,536
Reinforces married

3102
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:43,328
Yeah so you end up in a position

3103
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:47,424
Well yeah you know two steps forward one step back

3104
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:48,960
To some extent

3105
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:51,264
We've Ended up further down Alex Jones

3106
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,032
The timeline

3107
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:53,056
The Narrative perhaps

3108
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,360
Don't think that is what I'm talkin

3109
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,688
When I said his fate is in his hands

3110
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,992
He should realize

3111
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:03,552
I think he does on some level

3112
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:05,856
This works

3113
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,696
He just doesn't know how to make it

3114
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:10,720
Right

3115
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:16,096
Because certain level there is a real opportunity that's actually become available

3116
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,656
That he will not

3117
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:21,728
Know how to take it because

3118
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,264
He believed that if

3119
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:24,800
He's doing what he's doing

3120
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,848
It will work out now

3121
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:29,152
Because it always has

3122
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:34,016
He's gotten into somewhat of a holding pattern with him

3123
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:36,064
Yeah yeah a little bit

3124
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,856
Would really take for him

3125
02:35:38,112 --> 02:35:38,624
Get

3126
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:40,416
Through this

3127
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,440
Val venis

3128
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:42,720
Sure

3129
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:46,048
Get those Japanese

3130
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,704
It would really take is for him to get more extreme

3131
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,240
Same

3132
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:58,336
Similar things to narrative a little bit

3133
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:00,896
And cut it out with some of the

3134
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,712
Stuff that really is problem at

3135
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:05,504
Like we're talk about active races

3136
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,040
Write that sort of stuff

3137
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:12,416
That's all it would really take if you scaled some of that but that would also probably lose

3138
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,184
Bunch of Azadi

3139
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,464
I don't know

3140
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,488
Here's what does

3141
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:17,024
Here's how he does it

3142
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,048
Alright

3143
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,328
He

3144
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,120
Goes for the Redemption

3145
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:21,888
Narrative

3146
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:28,800
Healer no cuz he learned that everyone realize whatever

3147
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:33,664
The Redemption in like we like

3148
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:37,248
I mean he goes the full opposite direction

3149
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:40,576
I've been fighting this whole time

3150
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:43,136
The Republic Tavern

3151
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:43,904
Protect

3152
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:49,536
Was going to save us and at the end of the day

3153
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,840
He did not speak for me

3154
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:57,216
And if he doesn't speak for me and you know what we really need to do

3155
02:36:57,472 --> 02:37:03,616
We need to send a message not just to the mainstream media but to the government as it is who has

3156
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:08,736
President-trump

3157
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:13,088
And he listens to our power until he

3158
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:15,392
We will fight

3159
02:37:15,648 --> 02:37:21,792
The circumstances are almost perfect to that story that I brought up about

3160
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:26,656
Restaurants

3161
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:27,680
I hate

3162
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:29,728
The idea of this climate hoax

3163
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:36,128
But bulshit can't make their own rules make a principled stand on

3164
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:37,152
Against climate change

3165
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:40,480
But what matters

3166
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:42,016
That's yeah I must

3167
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:42,784
I must

3168
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,576
Philosophically make my break

3169
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,440
More likely is within

3170
02:37:49,952 --> 02:37:53,536
End up on Project Camelot

3171
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:57,632
Cuz he's going to realize big Kerry Cassidy now has a bigger reach today

3172
02:37:57,888 --> 02:37:59,936
So we can look forward to that episode

3173
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:01,984
That'll be great one so fun

3174
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:08,384
Can't wait for him to show up as a guest on a bunch of weirdo a****** YouTube channel god dammit

3175
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:10,944
Anyway Jordan

3176
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,504
If you wanted to find

3177
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,296
We have not

3178
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:18,112
Many social media

3179
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,392
No

3180
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:24,000
Feel like you pointed still not willing to hold

3181
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:25,792
Well they're not willing to do a lot of snow

3182
