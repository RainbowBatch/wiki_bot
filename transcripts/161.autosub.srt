1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,016
What up what up playboy

4
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,832
Like we did not do on our last episode

5
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
Situation with Chicago's weather

6
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
Started perfect nailed it

7
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
We would have gone something like

8
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
Doremi Faso Lottie yellow leather yellow leather

9
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,904
I know a lot of

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Completely caught up with doing that

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,912
Today's episode forgot again to make the sound drop

12
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,776
For arguing on the next episode

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Seriously

14
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
We made it through one round of the bracket

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,688
Okay Bubba

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
You're just hoping I would never bring it up

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
Garlic

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Pizza

19
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Deep reference

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,048
Alright alright

21
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,424
Maybe one person listening to this will get that belt

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Back labor

23
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Alright alright

24
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
I don't know

25
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
No let's just let it go

26
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
I wish I could

27
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
I do wish you would have brought him

28
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,112
Wish

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
But we have to get

30
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,512
To it

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
Also has been around

32
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
And we're thrilled to have her on board

33
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
Susanna

34
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
I'm a policy wonk

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
I guess I'm out Shanna welcome

36
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,968
Call swanky

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
We would appreciate it

38
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Everything is

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
Appreciate it I could use I work more if you'd like

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
Alright

41
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,024
Something I don't know your attitude

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Second of all

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
What time we're leaving was the best

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
I don't appreciate that we're not doing Project Camelot episode

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,968
Sound off that we aren't talking enough about modern-day Alex Jones alright

46
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
And so at is

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Schmidt

48
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
What

49
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Yu-Gi-Oh

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Yo

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
It's not a punishment

52
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
The people who demanded this

53
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
Right and also enjoy it it's more a

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
It's more of a

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Beware what you wish for

56
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Careful

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
You're keeping track

58
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
Over 50 people were gunned down

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
And Israel I didn't hear that

60
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Which makes for an episode of The Alex Jones Show

61
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,776
50 dead in protest

62
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Violet

63
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
As opposed to

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,552
Military murders unarmed people what other way

65
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Tubi

66
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Not all that song

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
I have two pretty fun out of context drops

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,815
We're about to turn your lights on

69
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
But that's something that Alex should say if he's like

70
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
Starting a rock concert at North Korea

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Write that like I like buffer did with

72
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Something money on the

73
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,415
Which unfortunately

74
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
The today's episode will also feature

75
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
As if Alex talking about Israel was not bad enough

76
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,399
It also involves an hour of goddamn Milo yiannopoulos

77
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Dammit

78
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Yes yes Dad

79
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,455
Nice dynamic

80
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
Applications that I don't I don't want to think about that at all

81
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
And I wish you hadn't said

82
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,487
We're going to jump in here and we'll get to get to Alex

83
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
The show but again

84
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
It's important that we remember that we're also concurrently doing an investigation

85
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
2009

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
I wanted 2009 Alex was

87
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Full throated Lee

88
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Supportive of the Palestinian

89
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
He was against

90
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
Bu violence and atrocities that were being perpetrated by Israel

91
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
Upon Palestinian population

92
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,695
Fairly obvious position not to shoot on our people

93
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Thousand

94
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
People

95
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Sniper fire

96
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,727
That's probably a lot of that stuff

97
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,895
Some of the problems Alex's rhetoric as we go along but let's let the nice to know that

98
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Actually

99
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
They just they stopped with the whole thing they're like

100
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
United States

101
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Barry Iraq

102
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,583
Perhaps really perhaps the best way to fully destroy the Jews

103
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
Is tricking them into starting a war with

104
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Is the Middle East

105
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Project

106
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Gentleman's draw

107
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Asbury

108
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Germany Lost World War

109
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
The Nazis didn't

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
That's really hard to argue

111
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Like Alexa

112
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Lost

113
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Your baby

114
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
They're not wrong

115
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Just

116
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
Try to yell as little as possible cuz you're going to be so mad

117
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,127
Good Start good start

118
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
Good starch

119
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
You and me both

120
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Political system

121
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
No

122
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Israel

123
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
Is not expanding

124
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
And telling me I can't have a church on my street

125
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,359
Israel is not telling me that my children have to submit to Allah

126
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Israel is not

127
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
You're almost

128
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
George Soros

129
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,487
Brothers country

130
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Oh boy

131
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
How many newspapers Publications

132
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Please

133
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
And they basically told me

134
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Yours

135
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
It's wrong but that's like him that's like humans

136
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Expressing is there like in the lawsuit

137
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
They also say

138
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
Alex routine

139
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Background information

140
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,927
It's really all about

141
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
To know that the powerful backing

142
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Is that we living in a spy movie that's only in his head

143
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Just clip up for Wii

144
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Conduit

145
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Technically true

146
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
I just kept that last so in there just to illustrate how long of a pause there is there

147
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
Going to be a lot of pauses as he tries to navigate the worst

148
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
Close to him

149
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Israel

150
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Is it explained

151
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Now if they were those how would you feel

152
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,687
You wouldn't feel great

153
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Might be against that right

154
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,807
Imagine yourself in the position of somebody who was

155
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Unless they perhaps

156
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
The people who work

157
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Actually

158
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Murdered by the government would then be on this you literally just a loose

159
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
Sedated

160
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
This project

161
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
This thought experiment that you're proposing is flawed

162
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
Requires a modicum of empathy is not on the table

163
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
Find abstract probably problem

164
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,047
Side effects

165
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
So this is going to be pretty much

166
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Be going

167
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
Theme throughout all of it

168
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
But I'm just going to talk about hating

169
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Israel

170
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Here's the issue

171
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Alex believes

172
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Nefarious powers that

173
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Play

174
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
In the world right now

175
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
Support Israel because the alternative

176
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
It's something

177
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Real scary

178
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,335
Smoke shop

179
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
That's a great work

180
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Program

181
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
Subaru

182
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Man

183
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Alicia

184
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Adulation

185
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,143
Avalon High

186
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
And the false prophet in control of Jerusalem

187
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Color

188
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,295
Jerusalem dollar for everytime Alex declares of Babylon

189
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Default

190
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
We were living because everybody

191
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,231
God dammit

192
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
Obama

193
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
Obama's advisers who by the way really funny I've been listen to 2009 we're never going to listen to clips

194
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:30,079
Sunstein wants animals to be able to

195
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Alright

196
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383

199
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
Hello Doug are legally allowed to confront

200
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,607
I want to take over Israel and Jerusalem

201
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Yep

Yeah together

203
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447

That's true

205
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:06,431
HBO

Fat like

208
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
It's hot

209
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
You need to prove anything you're saying

210
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
You know it's just it's tax

211
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Stacks of b******* images

212
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
Anyway anytime

213
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Perfect Christian

214
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Commentator talks about Israel

215
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Sooner or later you're going to go to sleep in a

216
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,831
Really what everybody likes about Israel is just like the

217
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
We definitely have to have it

218
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Cuz then

219
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Israel

220
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Is that what they think

221
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
Rid of Israel they be like

222
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
The Bible isn't real

223
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,335
Or if you get rid of Israel that means they were already in it

224
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Or something like that I don't know

225
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
I don't know ask about Rapture cuz it's always

226
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:18,111
Hard pass on this bike that I don't care to know like once I hear like Alex in a caller arguing free in

227
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
Post-trib rapture

228
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,327
That I like

229
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Spectrum

230
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
So anyway the Rapture is never mentioned

231
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
Here is some interesting

232
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Islam bashing

233
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Some boots touring

234
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,663
And Alex do something very interesting

235
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Not involved

236
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Wow they're lumped in with Christy

237
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,159
Really interesting research talking about Christianity

238
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,423
Islam Coronavirus

239
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
And you'll see that Islam is expanding

240
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Islam is not

241
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Contract

242
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
Christianity is Contracting

243
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Capitalism is Contracting

244
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Prosperity is

245
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
Remember during Barack Obama's inauguration

246
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
Beach break down when he was talking about how I brought up

247
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
I were at War

248
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,607
Economic troubles and Alex

249
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
Vector them together Alex just

250
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,799
Vectored Christianity capitalism and prosperity all together

251
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,223
I'm only doing this to Alex Jones

252
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,575
The vectoring but I'm only doing this because it's

253
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
He called out in

254
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,975
Bring it up every time

255
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Which I would say that the only thing

256
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Capitalism

257
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Christianity

258
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Common throughout their

259
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
History has been

260
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Exploitation of

261
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Minorities

262
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
People that

263
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Professed to help

264
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:18,431
Expand as far across the globe

265
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Is it possibly could

266
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
Does Deadpool look like

267
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,135
Two other lands they're spreading this

268
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
What's the First Nations

269
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
So much

270
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Emily Islam takes over your country

271
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Continue

272
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Tubi free

273
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Is expand

274
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,023
There are countries that are currently Islamic countries that are currently

275
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Islamic

276
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
Could work there is a house of Islam

277
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
There is the house of War

278
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
House of Windsor

279
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Pre-sex Gosa Gosa

280
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
I want to pause there for a second really quick

281
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Because all Alex is doing is taking this from a guy that he

282
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
He talked to during the inauguration of Donald Trump talking to a guy and the guy screamed

283
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
About the house of Islam in the house of War outside of the house

284
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Islam is the house of the world

285
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
How houses work

286
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
Well separate houses

287
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
Only have the house of

288
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Islam

289
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
And then everything else

290
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
Say what about the house of bugging

291
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,455
LL Cool J was on it I think

292
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Issue is that Alex

293
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
Just took this from this guy that he talk to you during the inauguration it didn't look at

294
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
To the concept at all

295
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Right there is the door of Islam are all hard

296
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Which are the two distinctions

297
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
Countries that are ruled

298
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Play Muslim

299
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Without

300
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
And you could you could

301
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
The darul harb is the house of

302
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Saphir translation

303
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
To some extent

304
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Not not a literal translation

305
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
From the Arabic

306
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
And also dar-al-islam

307
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
Doesn't mean the house of Islam

308
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Necessarily

309
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
It mostly meme

310
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
House of peace

311
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Is what

312
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
The word Islam

313
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Look at it in the Arabic

314
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
What it comes from is

315
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Come together like salon

316
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Salaam alaikum

317
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
Islam General

318
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Accepted to be translated as

319
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,639
To enter into a state of peace

320
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Surrender or

321
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Submission

322
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
And that's not exact not a good

323
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Translation

324
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
It's those who have entered in

325
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
State of peace

326
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
So if you look at the darul Islam

327
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
You have

328
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
The house

329
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Of those who have entered into

330
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
And those who have

331
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Interstate

332
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Nonky

333
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,703
Raccoon translated as War also a different language all I heard was the sound of

334
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
Dirty monsters out

335
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
Speak American

336
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Say gesundheit

337
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,527
There's also

338
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Which is the house of

339
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,647
Call Richard

340
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
Yeah it's like

341
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Between two countries that country would be said to

342
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
There's calm.

343
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Which is like hey you're cool

344
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:55,007
Yeah there's there's other distinctions that are made if you actually

345
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,359
The most but not all of that

346
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Do you like

347
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Just alyx

348
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
From somebody he was talking to on the street because it

349
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Fit into his world view of

350
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
Muslims want

351
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
To kill everybody who's not them

352
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
And he has incorporated

353
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Into

354
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
His rhetoric and his narrative

355
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
That's really f******

356
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Stupid

357
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Very bad

358
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
I'm going to say this over and over again

359
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
You are a f****** big italics

360
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
Leaving like a big

361
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,919
It's also it's also interesting insofar as

362
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,247
It reveals how terrible his stories

363
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Really are interred supplies

364
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Is because something really happens like

365
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
I met a guy on the street who said this

366
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,023
And I realized instantly that this was something that is so important

367
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Learning about dancing

368
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
He does not tell a story about that

369
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
That just gets a simile

370
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
Where is everything

371
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Isabel

372
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Which by the way

373
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,943
Exact end of this episode

374
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Instituted real time

375
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,575
I'm just completely making up a lot

376
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
Islam is already in control of most European countries

377
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Commentary

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
With more than

379
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Poor country

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
What

381
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Block

382
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
You have Checkmate control

383
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
35% of white people have a lot of

384
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
F****** power understand that ladies and gentlemen

385
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
I do

386
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
Not all countries in Europe

387
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Parliamentary government

388
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Not all of it

389
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
That doesn't mean that they all get

390
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
10% of the Coalition or whatever like

391
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
You have eight

392
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
That groups combined to 2% of whatever MN

393
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Absolutely

394
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
That's okay that's all that's awesome hot bulshit

395
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,368
Like if you if you look at the elections that are currently happening in Iraq

396
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
It is

397
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,000
The guy who is the guy who's winning is a fierce nationalist

398
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,792
Like they're so the

399
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,608
Consomme correct

400
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
Weirdly

401
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,544
Strange mixture of what's going on at like the more you look into it the more fascinating it be

402
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Because

403
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
What everybody kind of predicted

404
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Was the

405
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
The pro Iran

406
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
To get in there

407
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,784
I think was a pro-american guy or whatever

408
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
And he is not doing well

409
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Well

410
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
The pro Iran guy

411
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Not doing well

412
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
The pro Iraq guy

413
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
Who doesn't trust America or Iran

414
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Also

415
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Their governments

416
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,496
So the way that it set up

417
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
You got like 30%

418
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Of the phone

419
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,176
I meant they have to figure out how to deal with everybody else like a like a

420
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Parliamentary

421
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Democracy

422
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Like that today it's the same thing that happens when you get a

423
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
Labour and liberal Democrats

424
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
Coalition going on to serve

425
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
Nobody agrees on any

426
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
It's no different than any other system

427
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
So

428
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Jump

429
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Cuz we got a lot of clothes

430
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Last night as we recording this

431
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
OurTime

432
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
Israeli snipers

433
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Shot

434
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
And killed

435
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,552
It's over 50 at this point

436
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Absolutely

437
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
Footages come out of

438
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
Tear gas being dropped from like drones

439
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
And stuff like that

440
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
The Seas of people

441
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
A t-shirt

442
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
It's interesting cuz Alex

443
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Actually takes issue with that

444
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
But not for the reason

445
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
Is a l

446
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Yahoo said that it's absolutely true

447
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
That's not good

448
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,784
This is called leadership

449
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Trump was sticking Isis up his dirty a******

450
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,720
What happened

451
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Alright

452
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,096
Sister called not doing the same thing

453
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
In a failed piecemeal

454
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Across the fence

455
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
Having six kids

456
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,312
Why do Turbo

457
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,736
As a weapon system

458
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
What do you think his problem

459
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
Amazon didn't have a stake in it

460
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
No he would hate to accept Visa

461
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
Alright thanks

462
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,216
Alright alright mr.

463
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Because

464
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,736
And didn't fire it directly out of another human being whom he was

465
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
Injured miserably now you're not thinking like as a booster

466
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,232
With the psychology of the individual right you got to think about how f****** Petty

467
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Himself involved

468
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
I remember seeing that

469
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
Removing criticize 10 years ago

470
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
There's no use drones to surveil

471
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,976
Real property search

472
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
Over 1,000 newspaper

473
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,656
Who was the first

474
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
Disinformation pitch

475
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
If you're so funny fight Jade helm

476
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
Defensive posture about the

477
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,880
These articles that have come out that I have shown that Russia

478
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Control account

479
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
We're promoting

480
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Yeah

481
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,168
Really f****** defensive about that but I don't give a s***

482
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Really

483
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Really

484
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,824
The Palestinians how is

485
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Against

486
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Before that I only kept that part in at the end

487
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
To demonstrate

488
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
The he does not

489
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Say

490
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
It's wrong

491
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
This crowd of people

492
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,560
Years ago they made fun of me

493
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Updated bypass

494
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
But he said it was bad at the

495
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
The time

496
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Back then

497
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
Yeah

498
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,128
Nothing means anything

499
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Dammit

500
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Market

501
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Curfew Manatee about himself

502
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
The aftermath

503
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
Cuz I forgot what this

504
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,720
This is about it's just marked Alex seriously hate

505
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
So let's enjoy

506
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,424
Situation

507
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
That does not mean he doesn't get out of hand and

508
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Anime

509
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,880
Understand

510
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
It's disgusting

511
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,992
But I want to address that really fast

512
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
He's complaining the

513
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
The other story

514
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
The day with Palace

515
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,720
Look up suicide bomber

516
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,840
Yeah that's the one he's anywhere they were using

517
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Children

518
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Suicide

519
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Absolutely related

520
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Is that all

521
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Palestinian

522
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
That's right

523
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,896
Haven't you seen the that's right there everywhere

524
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
But that's his problem

525
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
The same mentality that leads into the stupid idea that

526
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
The globalist are all one big group that are against him and like Mexican dances

527
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Focused

528
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,232
Idea about his enemies

529
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
And it's just

530
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
It's caca

531
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
Recently I don't know

532
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
Disconnected or not but I want to say

533
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
There's something that is

534
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,872
Profoundly unsatisfying about doing the show

535
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,968
Because at the end of the day what we're doing is kind of a

536
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
Describe it

537
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Like you know who gets laid at a party

538
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,392
The guy who's like everything you know is wrong

539
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,744
Even if he's full of s*** that's really appealing if people are really turned on by that

540
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Where is the guy who's like

541
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Actually

542
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Most of the stuff you know

543
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,192
Kind of accurate you just got this morning Watts than you think but most of the broad strokes and stuff

544
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Is pretty close to what you're told

545
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Alright that's not right

546
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
I'm going to stop you right there

547
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
I'm going to say

548
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
What was the last party

549
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
It's been awhile

550
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Because the answer to that question is

551
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
Neither of those guys they're both creepy and weird

552
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
Those guys are in the corner talking to each other and everybody else is like but the guy who's

553
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
Okay baby I'm basing this off like when I was in college

554
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
Open your eyes

555
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,800
It's still more appealing and intriguing to be both I like your eyes are open just read a little more

556
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Littlemore's you understand

557
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Some of the

558
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:46,016
Pieces of the school is usually not the best

559
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
Are are like

560
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
I'm not going to make

561
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
These feathers gorgeous

562
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
I'm going to write

563
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
The 97th

564
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,096
Be able to like

565
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,424
Gin up his base and get everyone excited by saying

566
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,496
All these Muslims across the world are suicide bombing

567
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
If somehow

568
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
Conflating it with this

569
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Is real

570
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Massacre

571
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
For lack of a better word

572
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
Conflating those two things is going to get him a lot of

573
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Attention

574
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
Is base is going to love it

575
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,464
Where is us saying like no that's a completely different situation that it has no correlation

576
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
It's bad yes absolutely we certainly aren't

577
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
In favor that right

578
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:36,192
Making things up and inspector exam red.

579
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
Yeah Alex has the coat from and loves it right thing that's going on now

580
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,992
They're doing everything that you think about America in Red Dawn

581
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
That's what's happening to Palestine right now there's got a better

582
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
I like metaphorical

583
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
It's a direct

584
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,072
189 it's not an allegory

585
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Wonder Woman

586
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
They don't have cool Jack

587
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
I don't have cool bomber jackets

588
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
Palestinians we should go with Wolverine

589
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:21,248
Has Palestine okay letters alphabet on

590
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Alex said a choice has to be made

591
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
I think that there's one thing that could happen

592
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
To get him on board

593
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Turn them white

594
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
It would help

595
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Probably wouldn't hurt

596
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Turn the flashlight

597
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,664
Didn't he can come out with a really good

598
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
Concessions by the Israelis they've never done

599
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
Wendish

600
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,952
North Korea

601
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
Really wants to try to fix the problem

602
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
Is there women wearing hoods over their heads

603
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,264
Girl jungle Dawson

604
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
That's gross

605
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
That's really really gross pets

606
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
That's profound leave

607
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Disgusting into

608
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Painting

609
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Entire culture

610
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
With a broad brush

611
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,184
What I hear there's really nothing else to say

612
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
Like we shouldn't even respond

613
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Quite frankly

614
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm I'm at the point where like listening to modern-day Alex Jones

615
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
He doesn't deserve a response

616
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
Like that sort of rhetoric has no place in

617
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Decent Society

618
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
Here is why that rhetoric is

619
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Something that I

620
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
Immediately like latch

621
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
That is

622
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
My eyebrows are raped

623
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Oh that his viewpoint

624
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Is 100% correct

625
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
No problem I mean it look if they fall

626
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Those people are

627
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,888
All of our The Munsters you imagine them to be

628
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
So if you

629
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
Really dive into that world view it make

630
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Clearly

631
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Stupid

632
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,408
Clearly doesn't believe it

633
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Because if you really believe that

634
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Then you would f****** do something you would have killed those two girls at the pool shop

635
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Choice

636
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
What is that

637
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
But that same concept

638
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
The high-end respecting people who think

639
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Abortion

640
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
Is murder

641
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Brave

642
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
What is the look

643
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,496
If you believe that abortion is murdering a child of course your world

644
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
That's you should be doing

645
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
But you don't really believe

646
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:00,480
If you believe that you would do something you're not

647
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
So f****** Brit stop pretending

648
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,880
Stupid

649
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
So much what

650
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
Constantly comes back to you is like

651
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,048
We could have like a conversation probably about

652
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Conclusions

653
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
The people come to

654
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
But people seem really reticent

655
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
The debate

656
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Discuss the premise

657
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,288
And the premises are the one part or the parts that are

658
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Profoundly flawed

659
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,408
Because in order to make that argument that Alex Jones

660
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Is premises in his argument

661
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
Is it all or both

662
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Muslims

663
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,856
Are just their identity is putting their women in bags

664
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
And cutting off their children

665
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
And I putting their bombs on their children

666
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Moral

667
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
It's our moral imperative

668
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Right stop.

669
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,752
But that promise is not something else would ever want to discuss

670
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Because it's Pat

671
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
It's absolutely

672
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
He doesn't believe

673
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,432
Who cares whether he believes it or not

674
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
It doesn't matter

675
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,320
Level up

676
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,392
At the very least respect

677
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,744
Lego

678
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Pimply

679
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Weirdly

680
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,496
People who say they believe it

681
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
I meant like

682
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Again

683
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
It comes back to like you've accepted this argument without looking

684
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
Bring it what it's built on you don't know what

685
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Is

686
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Supporting

687
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,440
You come to your example abortion is murder is the

688
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
Looking at

689
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Alex's argument Muslims evil

690
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
They don't

691
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
Have any bearing in reality

692
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Anyway even when the even when you

693
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Which like

694
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Yes

695
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
This is an issue

696
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Ed we're on board

697
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
Genital mutilation

698
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,136
Guess what

699
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
There's a bunch of

700
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Liberal organization

701
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
That work

702
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,328
Young women

703
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
But there's a bunch of atoms

704
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
MC organization

705
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,752
Computer on the ground working trying to help people trying to change the way

706
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
No young women are brought up

707
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,128
Open for in contact with trying to evolve population

708
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Right

709
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Alex is doing any of that s***

710
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Okies injecting

711
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,624
Squeezing into the national conversation

712
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Slightly

713
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
The Muslims are going to take over

714
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,424
And what have you heard

715
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,568
Alarm

716
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:12,480
So this leads us to a new segment on the show

717
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Set alarm

718
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,880
Sound the alarm

719
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Alright

720
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,512
It is extremely important to introduce geopolitical disorder into the internal American activity

721
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
Encouraging separatism and ethnic social and racial conflict

722
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Actively supporting all dissident

723
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
Extremist

724
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,264
Sectarian groups destabilizing

725
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,824
Political processes in the United States

726
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
Guy

727
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:55,744
Did not sound the alarm he's heading on the show multiple times

728
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,304
Is from page 367

729
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Facebook Foundation

730
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
Games of GTA

731
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
He heard him

732
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Well but I mean like

733
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
He's literally sitting sweetie to

734
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:13,920
Destabilize and completely crippled the United States we can bring the Soviet Union back together

735
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Way to stop the globe

736
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,696
It's apocracy but who gives a

737
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
So here's out

738
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Abundantly

739
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Liquid Esports

740
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,960
It just comes down to that I'm not labeled a radical Islam and

741
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Fights for Israel

742
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
Israel

743
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Works

744
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
I don't see how that works

745
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
I do not see how that works

746
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,720
Alex got a hotline to be read

747
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
What is that

748
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:05,888
So if I if I come on my radio show and I say

749
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:10,240
People who died Israel has right to kill him

750
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
I get a seat at the

751
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
The table where I can try and help things from within

752
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
What makes

753
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
Perfect

754
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
What

755
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
It's a long time

756
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
It's a long day

757
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,832
Have we considered that perhaps Alex is eventually going to the

758
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:31,232
Progressive Revolution from the inside

759
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
That's right

760
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
I can see it

761
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:42,240
Are the are the turn has been all the other

762
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,616
It has been

763
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,920
Rationality

764
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
Put flawed

765
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
From

766
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,904
Hilarious

767
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
Florida Humanity

768
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,512
I would say probably in 2009

769
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
To outright

770
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Completely

771
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
Irredeemable

772
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Monstrous

773
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Estimate

774
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Cultural

775
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Bigot

776
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Violence and

777
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Agonistic

778
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Buck Lake

779
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
Is nothing

780
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,688
I guess you could have a Jonah in the whale kind of moment

781
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,272
But you expect that to been when

782
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Said the Trump show prices of Dark Knight where you sitting there alone

783
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,744
What have I become

784
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
It's not

785
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
He's worse smell

786
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
He wrestled with

787
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,008
And came out the wrong

788
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,568
He's like I like it in the whale

789
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
Well you know what I wanted

790
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
And let me tell you something

791
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Feels good

792
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
This particular show

793
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
I'm sure that I will feel much better

794
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Thomas episode

795
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
So supportive of Israel

796
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Seems foolish

797
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Yeah but that's

798
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Okay

799
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
This is going to be a

800
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:28,735
Not like not as well researched

801
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
But

802
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
At this point supporting Israel's government

803
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
Is maybe the most anti-Semitic

804
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,535
To some extent and nobody is working harder to destroy the Jewish

805
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
The government of the Jewish state

806
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Yeah

807
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
But

808
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,031
Up to this point Alex is not really dealt with what the actual news

809
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
Rod coming out of Israel

810
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
It's murder

811
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,711
Not the whodunit

812
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:04,575
Like murder on the Orient Express

813
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
The story in

814
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
Next clip

815
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Turns out to be a

816
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,143
Palestinians in 1400

817
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
Other way to take that I'll tell you this

818
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
Take that headlight without being like

819
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Oh

820
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,943
The bad guy is the murderer

821
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
At least

822
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
At least you didn't say

823
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:41,183
Israel kills

824
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,719
Just saying

825
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,327
Free 5,000 protesters rally against the US Embassy opening in Jerusalem

826
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Overseen by trumps

827
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Middle East

828
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,447
Ivanka

829
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Is it

830
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,759
Drones

831
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
But you see

832
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
Route

833
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,743
Hourly suicide bombings

834
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,007
The only way you know about it is because of people

835
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
2400

836
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,943
Because if it was islamists doing it they would they would not say

837
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Muslims or Islam

838
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:43,647
Fun semantic point you have no evidence at all

839
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
Like that

840
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Think of a

841
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
Terrorist

842
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Attacked

843
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Attack

844
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
911

845
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
That has

846
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
Killed more than

847
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:05,151
50 and wounded more than 1,000

848
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Out of it that's a

849
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,223
All that really means is

850
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
These terrorists just want to

851
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,535
No no. Kill

852
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
No I think a couple of

853
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,191
I could be complaining it with all the other

854
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
Everyone's confused why I'm not telling you I have neighbors

855
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Catchphrase

856
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:43,039
I don't get really worried that like 9:30 or so

857
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,511
God damn it took another phone

858
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
Las Vegas

859
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
Ohio

860
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
Spell it doesn't

861
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
It doesn't matter

862
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
$50

863
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
I don't

864
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
I don't

865
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
Understand I'm just driving how you can

866
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Any

867
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
But to be fair

868
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,991
Murders 50 people and wounds 2000

869
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Does that are

870
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
Just people

871
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
They're not people

872
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
They're just there

873
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,767
People Are People

874
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
At the other side of it

875
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,399
I think it's a dumb idea you like

876
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Complete

877
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Complete vacuum

878
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Dumb idea

879
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,287
To be mad that there's a US Embassy in Jerusalem

880
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
It's all just made up

881
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,199
Your religions are lies

882
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:47,551
I'd like if you want to get down to the fundamental underpinnings of all of it I agree

883
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,743
None of this means anything human beings are weird f*****-up creatures and there just creating reasons

884
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
I hate each other

885
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
What happened for fun

886
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
What 4000 goddamn years now like what and what else do we need on this ship I have neighbors

887
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
If you're interested.

888
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
Can you just see the encroaching

889
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Monster

890
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,151
The US Embassy

891
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Did you recently

892
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,503
Is just a signal that the United States is going to watch

893
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
Everybody you know

894
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Murder

895
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,487
Moving that Embassy to Jerusalem is them saying

896
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Specifically

897
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
We don't care how many.

898
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
This is Ben

899
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,471
The second statement on the show Jordan

900
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Shut up

901
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,031
And I have no response

902
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,311
Let's go to next clip

903
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
I mean it's not interesting in terms of

904
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Content

905
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
About

906
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Muslim

907
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
Wake your f****** say you're staying

908
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,023
This isn't Trump's this isn't

909
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:06,399
U.s. Embassy to Jerusalem has been around since

910
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,239
Rake

911
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
How to divide

912
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
Who plays of kushners

913
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Even Lakes

914
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
The point is that like many presidents

915
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
Going to do it the reason I do it is because they were like

916
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,023
If we do this that the United States to everybody

917
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,143
We will watch message resonates

918
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,495
Throughout much larger territory than Palestine

919
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
It does

920
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
Absolutely send

921
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
Now

922
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,759
Suicides horrible message Jesus

923
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
Make me feel by

924
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,559
Clearly you think I am no I appreciate it but I don't know how to respond to it

925
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,935
I could have responded to two points earlier but now I'm out

926
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
Anyway Alex

927
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Hear Rance a little bit about Islam but

928
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
It's important to listen

929
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,591
Because what he says at the end

930
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Is

931
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Particularly glaring

932
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
And I don't think you means at the way I

933
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
I think

934
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Everyone

935
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,695
What is real Flash

936
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
Christian

937
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,311
Killing little girls

938
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,671
It's almost a little girls getting raped

939
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:10,815
Hottest

940
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,887
Constantly

941
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Yes

942
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
That's why I play that

943
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
You see how my brain works

944
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Clearly

945
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,551
Beach

946
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,023
3 what is it that there was just a BBC article about

947
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
Girls

948
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
Being raped and then lit on fire in ND

949
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,679
Like this is a thing that everybody

950
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
Like

951
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
Viola, he talked about

952
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
Dude

953
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,623
Like if you want to be a conformist gender concept guy

954
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,183
If you if you want to just be so

955
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
Reductive

956
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,791
Then look at the world weigh Alex does

957
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
More common through line is

958
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,607
Testosterone

959
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Alex cell

960
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,679
Crepe

961
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Great great

962
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,519
So at this point we're done

963
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,055
He has real stuff for now

964
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,615
But we will get back to it

965
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
That are

966
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
Particularly

967
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
Goodnight Moon

968
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,295
Jumps off any good

969
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
Get back to another narrative

970
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
We talked about the past

971
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Development

972
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
But what's more important about

973
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
Is that weird

974
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
The point where

975
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
It 2018

976
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
Alex is just really trying to get a tan

977
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
Really desperately

978
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
And you can hear it at the beginning of this

979
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
Clip when he's even trying to introduce the

980
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
The story is about to talk about

981
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,359
Really more concerned at the idea of like we need this go viral

982
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Call Alex Jones about 10 minutes ago

983
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,135
I really want to have this go viral because this illustrates everything

984
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
That this was going to end up happening

985
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
We not

986
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Los Angeles

987
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
2017

988
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,383
Exposing others in California

989
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
Misdemeanor

990
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,415
Give blood

991
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,255
The Thriller

992
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
Virtue signaling

993
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,055
It was racism or something insured up

994
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,151
LA County

995
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,503
Are skyrocketing officials racism and stigma

996
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
And he starts laughing

997
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,647
I want to really bring into sharp Focus

998
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:22,047
Chris is the reason the California made it not a felony anymore

999
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
Because part of that law special

1000
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Is that him

1001
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
If you

1002
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Don't know your status

1003
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
And you give it to somebody

1004
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,639
Then you can't be held accountable in a court of law cuz you didn't know your status

1005
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
And people would probably be more scared to find out

1006
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,527
Because then the test would be on record

1007
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,623
It would prove that they did know that they had it or something like that

1008
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,975
Instances where like even if you use protect

1009
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Condom

1010
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,327
There are situations like that

1011
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399
People have done studies and they figured out that

1012
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,959
The end result of criminalizing

1013
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
Having HIV in pipe

1014
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
Somebody

1015
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
Is the people don't get

1016
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,639
And so in order to try and work against

1017
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
Decriminalize

1018
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,711
It is one of those situations

1019
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,735
Are the

1020
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,271
A practical solution

1021
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,343
Runs counter to your idea of

1022
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,439
Like that's a that's a ferret of well just like

1023
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
Just like with

1024
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
Cocaine or whatever it is you want to do

1025
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,119
The Practical reality of

1026
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
Cocaine trafficking

1027
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
Is that because it's illegal

1028
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
It's far more profit

1029
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,823
About to be a murderous cartel

1030
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
The kind of situation

1031
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Solution

1032
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
Is legalizing

1033
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
This truck that you have been trained

1034
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
Since you were

1035
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
3 year old

1036
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,087
To think is the most heinous crime

1037
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:54,463
So that doesn't make that doesn't drive with people's natural scent of

1038
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Like

1039
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,047
Of punishment should

1040
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Equal the crime

1041
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,887
Right right

1042
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
I can kind of understand

1043
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,495
And that because if you recall when are first

1044
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
Our first reactor maybe my first

1045
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Action was like

1046
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,871
I don't know if this is a good idea

1047
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,687
You know like it should be a crime to

1048
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
Give somebody a chive

1049
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
Yeah it should be

1050
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
If you don't know

1051
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
But it's the same

1052
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,719
Breakfast

1053
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
That seems

1054
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:34,399
That seems counterintuitive to take your sense of no that you can't be held

1055
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
Responsible for the crime if you don't know

1056
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
That

1057
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,503
Will only lead to this morning

1058
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,807
Read this new LA Times article cuz these are

1059
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Completely different

1060
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
Stories

1061
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
No idea what this

1062
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
About

1063
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,815
In LA county half of chlamydia cases in a third of

1064
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,399
Is diagnosed that each year among the people

1065
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
15 + 24

1066
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,007
Miles for my point

1067
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,151
These are not people who are getting blood transfusions on a map scale so that idea of being able to donate blood is

1068
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
Out the window

1069
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
About how

1070
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
Quote absent only works

1071
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,135
One boy said he had known

1072
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
STDs from anal sex

1073
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
So that's not

1074
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
Yeah but that's just

1075
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,327
So also this article.

1076
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,543
Is that there's a few gone to read the entire article it makes it very clear that this

1077
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Is not a specific

1078
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
And unique experience for California

1079
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Quote

1080
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Nationwide STD rates

1081
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,455
I've been climbing for the past 5 years

1082
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,783
More people are diagnosed with syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhea 20

1083
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
16 that ever before

1084
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Some blame underfunding of Esther

1085
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
TD prevention programs as well as failing

1086
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,695
Falling condom usage

1087
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,535
There's also speculation the people are having sex with more partners because of hookup

1088
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
And the reason that they bring up race

1089
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
In this article as a possible

1090
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Contributor is

1091
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
Statistics

1092
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:19,615
Those are dangerous the picture is more complicated when it comes to the high STD rate among minorities

1093
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Gay bisexual men make up the vest

1094
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
Majority of Nucynta

1095
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Pinellas County

1096
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Syphilis rates among a

1097
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
African American women are

1098
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
Times higher than white women

1099
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
Three times higher than Latina with

1100
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,207
Center for Health Equity director Heather northover

1101
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
So that officials need to evaluate what's called

1102
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,303
Structural or systemic racism

1103
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,655
The way housing or education policies May negatively affect people and their

1104
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:47,007
Studies have found for example the people with HIV have low levels of literacy

1105
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,639
Outside people with HIV who had low levels of literacy were less likely to follow the treatment

1106
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
And that poor Americans

1107
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Time to work

1108
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
We're bored like

1109
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,527
Did engage in Risky sexual behavior increasing

1110
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
Do all of this

1111
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,647
To go back to the club of Rome is a problematic

1112
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
There are so many

1113
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,767
Pieces that come into it when you look at one problem

1114
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Another problem

1115
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
All you're doing is ensuring that none of them ever

1116
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,143
It is completely stupid

1117
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,959
Alex Jones

1118
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,847
Okay

1119
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,127
Fruition

1120
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,503
I let myself down.

1121
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,415
But I thought why not have some of the diasco Malek's

1122
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,767
I think cost

1123
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
So we're going to see if I could be a good boy today

1124
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
Good boy today

1125
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,703
Certainly haven't so far

1126
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
I want to give

1127
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,311
Like

1128
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
Is already back talk about his return

1129
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:02,271
I'm just not of the coal cost of living for Palestine

1130
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,671
But I'm also not

1131
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
For the people over there

1132
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
They got tons of nuclear weapons

1133
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
Anywhere

1134
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
Samsung watch

1135
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
So couple things really quick

1136
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,455
Not knowing how to speak

1137
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Samsonov

1138
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
Hey Alex

1139
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
You know what that is

1140
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:41,951
That's a plan that Israel has

1141
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
If we plan that the global is running Israel have

1142
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
Must be a

1143
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,143
Destroying everybody

1144
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,447
By the way Iran if you're listening

1145
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons

1146
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,823
So they're not going anywhere

1147
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
Maybe

1148
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,663
Do things have a lot in

1149
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
Via the other the thing is that like

1150
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Legitimate

1151
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,671
Four years was that Israel play

1152
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,975
About whether or not they had poops because of Alexa

1153
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
Schrodinger's nuke

1154
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,815
Wrecking all that ideas like maybe

1155
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,351
Adoption is

1156
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,935
Taking everything down being like yep we're going to f****** attack you in this

1157
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
Brett complete destruction

1158
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,287
That's a plan of theirs it's not a plan a saurus

1159
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,359
Implying it

1160
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,479
No also Soros does not want to destroy as really doesn't want to blow it off the map

1161
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
All the stuff that Alex is

1162
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,807
Referring to is like there's some WikiLeaks

1163
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Square

1164
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Females

1165
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
The discus

1166
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Cirrhosis views on Israel

1167
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
And it's just that

1168
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
The regime that

1169
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Empower is

1170
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
The racist

1171
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Awful

1172
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,119
Yeah you should be out should not be

1173
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,191
It's not destroying Israel

1174
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,055
It's not that he's not anti-israel

1175
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Anti

1176
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
This

1177
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,039
United States

1178
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:16,671
I am not a literal Nazis running Israel

1179
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Looking dice

1180
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Keep dreaming Soros

1181
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
Keep dreaming devil Pope

1182
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,263
Bring in Israel

1183
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Because

1184
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
Israel

1185
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
You haven't

1186
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
Also

1187
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Ochsner

1188
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,191
I've been

1189
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
Attacked

1190
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,543
Coming after my funding

1191
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
My pigtails

1192
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
I can

1193
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Give you an explanation

1194
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,135
Why your enemies of the same as Israel's enemies

1195
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
But you're not going to like my answer

1196
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Not these

1197
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,327
Philosophically

1198
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,887
Behavior of

1199
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,703
Israel

1200
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Either

1201
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:38,335
It's almost as though we have a ideological fruit

1202
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
1 witches knot

1203
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
Depended upon

1204
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Definitely not

1205
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,111
Anyway Alex gets office

1206
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
Alex gets off Israel for a moment

1207
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
Because he wants to chime in on the Stormy Daniels situation

1208
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,095
I only get this in because it's

1209
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,479
5000 horsepower

1210
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
What

1211
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,463
Right there right

1212
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:39,007
We got up there and talk about family values all day long

1213
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,055
Never do that

1214
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:47,455
I'd like to direct Alex's attention to every time he denied all of these honors

1215
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,015
Literally every time

1216
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,855
He did that

1217
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Every sport

1218
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
He talked about

1219
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,255
Freedom Christian f****** Gathering

1220
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,071
Childtime

1221
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:08,447
He literally does this is just equivocating

1222
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,287
Imagine if like I don't know

1223
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,639
Cedar America

1224
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,967
Yeah

1225
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
If he was just like

1226
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Michelle Obama looks like

1227
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,623
And f***

1228
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,647
Yeah that's bad

1229
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
Sugru

1230
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,975
It's so gross

1231
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
Say that I haven't had

1232
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
View

1233
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
Stop it I think it's so gross

1234
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,911
Alex is like

1235
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Cheese looks like

1236
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
She's got five

1237
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Horsepower

1238
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
Is it dead

1239
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,663
Wolf that there's so many layers to how disgusting that it is but grass

1240
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,015
A pornstar

1241
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
His wife is hotter

1242
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,135
In my mind in my mind

1243
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:04,255
There we go which apparently dropped

1244
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
Does not agree with me

1245
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
Does he have to keep sucking all these other people

1246
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:12,191
We are now back to

1247
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
God I wish we were

1248
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,775
We're now back now

1249
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,823
2009 Revolt 2

1250
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Call Greg

1251
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,991
The media never covers

1252
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,575
But they want a bunch of wires

1253
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:33,183
Trying to break

1254
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
Into is

1255
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
But you trying to

1256
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Kubrick

1257
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
Israel

1258
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
Houston ulcers make

1259
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
Can fun of their death

1260
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
Which is real real gross

1261
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
For this article from

1262
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
New Yorker today

1263
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,823
A nervous Frisian ran through the crowded

1264
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Push towards the fence

1265
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
Gaza and Israel on

1266
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,431
Sunday evening holding 75t

1267
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
The Wire

1268
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
I traveled the gods of

1269
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,807
From Cairo ahead of what we expected the enormous demonstrations

1270
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
The Border fence

1271
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
I want the first

1272
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,463
I want the first see the site of the protest on what I thought would be an uneventful evening

1273
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
It did not turn out that

1274
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Has clusters of Gaza

1275
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Milled about

1276
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
Israeli snipers watch

1277
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,399
From the other side barely visible in their fortified purse

1278
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
I watched it

1279
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,519
A group of young Palestinian women step forward in dark cloaks

1280
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
Colorful snake

1281
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
Gesticulating wildly

1282
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
Quote This Is Our Land not yours yelled one

1283
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Then

1284
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,431
Suddenly

1285
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Two bullets slammed into the ground in front of

1286
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
I'm picking up

1287
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Pops up.

1288
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
The crowd jolted in the women's retreat

1289
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
About 50

1290
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
But minutes later they were moving forward again taunt

1291
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Sing the soldiers

1292
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
Another shot rang out

1293
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,535
And this time one of the women fell to the ground

1294
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
Clutching her stomach

1295
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
BaByliss raced along the bumpy ground

1296
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,167
An emergency workers scoop the woman up

1297
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
And raced off

1298
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
Trail bike riding with

1299
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,287
My colleague and I gave three of them a lift to the hospital

1300
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,335
Did it not seem too.

1301
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,383
Did not seem sure who the woman was

1302
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,431
Only the cheapest standing alongside them

1303
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
I finally learned the woman's name

1304
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
Housewife earrings

1305
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:09,183
When I found her mother in the hospital Corridor cheek smeared with tears clutching her daughter SilverSneakers in

1306
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
In a plastic bag

1307
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
Miss Liz Oswald

1308
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
I was watching Yuri 26

1309
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,631
Was born it with a with a mental disabilities that her brother

1310
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Muhammad

1311
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,983
She learned embroidery at a school for people with disability

1312
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
Letter to the protest

1313
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
She wanted to show off the embroidered bags

1314
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Cell phone covers

1315
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,919
Not know how she ended up in the front of

1316
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
The crowd

1317
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
She was not behaving in a violin

1318
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,295
He said

1319
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
She was not holding a stone

1320
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
So what's the excuse for shooting her

1321
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
So that's one of the victims

1322
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
She's actually didn't die they thought you

1323
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,143
She was dead but she's just ended up in critical condition

1324
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,935
I don't know maybe she's dead

1325
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
She wasn't

1326
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Set the oppressed

1327
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
So

1328
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
Really wish I didn't have

1329
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Nuremberg

1330
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,711
Well don't forget the Nuremberg trials LOL

1331
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Jurisdiction

1332
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,903
Come up when you when you talked about that for a child and laws

1333
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
Fiction is my issue

1334
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
When Alex comes on air inbox

1335
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
The people who died

1336
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
We're murdered

1337
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,959
And then beyond that murdered

1338
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:29,567
Paints the picture that these people who were shot were all aggressors or

1339
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,943
Trying to climb the wall and stormed the barricades

1340
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
Patata

1341
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Whatever

1342
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
Alex impression

1343
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
A lot of them or not

1344
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,743
A lot of people were shot

1345
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
Humans

1346
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,167
So anyway now we get to Milo yiannopoulos

1347
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
On the show

1348
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,823
As if it couldn't get worse

1349
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,127
Comes on

1350
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
Pickle dick

1351
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,223
Starts off his appearance

1352
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
He's got a theory about sjw

1353
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:15,135
We talked about how I

1354
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
He got kicked out of that New York Bar

1355
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
Remember those I recalled

1356
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
Why is everything about bullying

1357
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,567
I just never ends

1358
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,847
Alright might

Bi-State Justice Warriors

1360
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,575
I understand where you're coming from but I promise there's a reason I'm playing it

1361
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
I was about that

1362
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Trust

1363
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
Trust my technique

1364
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
Please

1365
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:58,143
Visit other people's behavior because they're unhappy with their own people's psychology because they

1366
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,263
Have something defective about their arms make everybody else miserable because they themselves are suffering

1367
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
Is that bar in New York

1368
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,615
And I was I just went for brunch

1369
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Also

1370
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,967
When you talk about people suffering

1371
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Have you ever

1372
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
They don't want other people

1373
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Nope

1374
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:31,679
By the way from the gay magazine he worked for for writing a profile

1375
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Looks looks at me now

1376
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,895
We just went in there for brunch can you drive

1377
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:47,295
Previous Mission between

1378
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695

1379
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,727
And purple

1380
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,031
PS2 monstrosity

1381
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,767
Neighbors neighbors

1382
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,327
I also this lady was fat

1383
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,863
Sabaton

1384
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,679
You f****** ass

1385
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
Reacted at least use multiple sentences to be a f****** a******

1386
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:47,967
Reacting sorry this is the reason that I'm putting this on the show

1387
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
Is because

1388
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,551
We need to really look at that

1389
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Trolling

1390
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
They they think they are

1391
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
What they're doing is just

1392
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
Being horrible and like

1393
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,023
Dish TV and thinking they're funny

1394
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
But they're doing it

1395
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Specifically because there

1396
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Desperate

1397
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,191
Yeah that's true

1398
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
They know Alex knows on sublevel

1399
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,799
That I have Milo on the show

1400
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
And we say a bunch of f****** horrible stuff right

1401
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
It's true game absolutely and the more everybody else gets mad then

1402
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
More the people

1403
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,975
Support them are like well obviously if it makes them mad

1404
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:36,351
This game is so easy to see through

1405
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,143
Lame I watch this and I like

1406
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
I get it I see what you doing guys

1407
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:47,615
Then you even pointed out that even a block away and all of them

1408
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
So lame

1409
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,295
But I do want to listen to a little bit of it just to drive home the point that like they're doing the stuff on purpose

1410
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,087
Here's them talk about lesbians

1411
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
Before this

1412
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,927
They've been talking about how the bars at

1413
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
But he got kicked out of or got yelled at

1414
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,279
It's called The Churchill

1415
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
And accidentally

1416
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
Heavy air quotes

1417
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,631
Accidentally

1418
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,191
Stumbled into a meeting of the New York socialist

1419
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,983
I bet that's not an act

1420
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,519
I bet that wasn't

1421
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:20,127
Great thanks my love

1422
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
I love women

1423
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:46,239
I just asked you why they all have

1424
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:51,615
Smolich go out

1425
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,895
I mean this is just like

1426
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
He's hacked fan

1427
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,807
That's really you like me to host the rest of the hours of witches

1428
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,975
Limit a nice resort

1429
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:18,495
We're all afraid of

1430
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:23,359
Commercial Alex plays that video of

1431
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
The girl in a Sailor Moon costume

1432
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Yeah

1433
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,015
He claims he didn't delete from the internet but that

1434
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,087
She posted on Twitter

1435
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Because

1436
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:39,743
If you don't know what I'm talking about you can go look it up on

1437
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Dog YouTube now

1438
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
Infowars reporter who I don't even know who she is

1439
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Between Zetas

1440
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:52,031
Really low on the totem pole she comes up to this girl is drinking iced coffee

1441
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
And on her phone

1442
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,103
The different Millie Weaver character

1443
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:01,503
No it's not Billy Weaver it's like Eddie Murphy

1444
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
Coming to America Whiteface

1445
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:09,695
Full transformation

1446
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
Okay no I'm not going

1447
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,303
Go over the entire video

1448
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,607
They end up playing the entire thing

1449
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:22,751
It's basically this reporter just trying to ask got your questions and the girls been like really different

1450
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
Twisted

1451
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:35,295
It's pretty hilarious if you if you are a

1452
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,599
Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Saturn

1453
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,695
That was edited out of

1454
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
Cuz they are

1455
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
Maybe

1456
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Funny point is

1457
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,399
She's like you guys have a

1458
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,287
Sasa Sushi

1459
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Hilarious

1460
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:04,479
Very funny video and I Alex they play it and they're just like

1461
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
She is so stupid

1462
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,879
She can't even talk

1463
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,487
It it's not worth it I was going to play the entire thing

1464
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
Just to see they're like

1465
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,095
Just watch their breakdown of it

1466
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
At this point

1467
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Alex and

1468
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,775

1469
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,823
Start shooting on max

1470
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
Sweetwater's

1471
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
It's for a reason

1472
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
There's a reason

1473
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,247
What

1474
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
Panda

1475
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
It's disgraceful

1476
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Exactly

1477
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,951
The same thing that I got Bill O'Reilly

1478
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
A lot of hot water

1479
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
Flying Saucer

1480
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:57,471
What is up with the left cuz they really are it was a part of crazy people

1481
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,799
What is a rising on this planet

Sushi cover for Galaxy

1483
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:16,671
Call Ray

1484
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
Add dog

1485
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,887
You just showed too many cars there Alex

1486
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
You just showed too many cards

1487
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,751
I love that everyone's talking about how much

1488
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
In front of her

1489
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
Let's do more of it

1490
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:43,551
America

1491
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,799
Bill is Bill Gates

1492
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,439
Walmart.com

1493
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,007
Hahaha he's a guy who's running again

1494
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
Maxine water

1495
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,079
Gotcha

1496
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,455
Understand

1497
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Conservative comedian

1498
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,039
Caught

1499
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,855
Funny so funny

1500
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
To the cross

1501
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
It's a bit

1502
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,439
You know man like

1503
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Old man the turns

1504
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
The sleight of hand

1505
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
Things never do the obvious

1506
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:04,447
I want to talk to you a little bit about Omar Navarro because Alex Jones said I'm not going to get into his background

1507
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,055
So I'm going to do it I should tell you one thing fits they don't say it any point

1508
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:13,151
And that is that Rodger stone is one of Navarro's Bank campaign advisor

1509
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
And I think that's probably a federal elections

1510
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:22,367
Pretty violation

1511
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,231
By appealing to the district's growing Latino population

1512
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:33,119
Opposition to Waters at centerpiece of his campaign

1513
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:39,519
Alex Jones

1514
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:46,431
If people really want to take a jab at Maxine Waters and everything she say against President Trump donate to my campaign

1515
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:51,295
Navarro said on Infowars shortly after he announced his candidacy in late May

1516
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,367
Also if you look at it made like

1517
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,207
30 Grand in donations the last time you tried to do this cuz he runs

1518
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Augusta Road Vet

1519
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,279
This time he's made 100,000

1520

Does General Flynn has come out in the doors Tim

1522
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
There's a really funny joke

1523
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:14,336
That quote that Donald the offensive firing back at the GOP

1524

Friday was the first time

1529
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:33,536
He spoke publicly since pleaded guilty last year to Lions pfbi conversations with a Russian diplomat

1530
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,120
He broke his silence to be like this guy

1531
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
He's good

1532
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:47,104
Whatever you think about Omar Navarro

1533
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,152
Whatever you think about him

1534
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,944
You can't take away that he is a

Last month

1544
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,736
The event ended with a skit in which

1545

Navarro intervened and pull off the waters wig as a dozen or so attendees applauded

1548
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
You can find the video of it

1549
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,608
It's disgraceful

1550
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Also

01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
Vista

1552
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
It must have happened after

1553
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,544
The time the joyful celebration party

1554
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,872
It was sexually assaulted by Corey Lewandowski

1555
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688

Did various Los Angeles County cities

1579
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,952
This article was fake so I wanted to look into it

1580
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,488
What were these various

1581
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:15,072
Political activities that he was forced to step down with Valen

1582
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840

Traffic Commission

1585
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,056
What is even

1586
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
That

1587
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
From the LA Times quote

1588
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,712
He resigned as a Torrance traffic commissioner

And subsidiary

1594
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:06,272
Videos of the incident show Navarro in the backseat of a car while driver in another pass

1595
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,296
Spray rally

1596
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
So people expressing their right

1597
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624

01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,696

Car

1600
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,536
So that's why he had to resign from his post

1601
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
In the torrent

1602
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
I Baba blah

Pretty well.

1609
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:38,528
Is just an adjective

1610
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:42,880

Publican

1613
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
The County's GOP leadership revoke the charter of the club earlier this year for attacking members of its executive committee

1614
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,752
Violating its bylaws

1615
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,568
I tried to look into that and

1616
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:07,456
All the articles I could find who like this is an internal matter they wouldn't talk about what they actually did

1617
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
I've got a really

1618
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,832
Just hitting the Rogue Beast

Help

1623
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:38,176
Navarro reached for comment Wednesday morning was about his criminal conviction

1624
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:44,832
He initially said they're quote a lot of Omar Navarro's implying the hold on

1625
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Strong

1626
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,120
Strongfirst Vale

1627
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
First stop

1628
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
There are a lot of Hobart

1629
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,368
So you can't prove it

1630
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,928
Are there alot of Omar Navarro

1631
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Implying the perhaps

1632
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,256
They was convicted of the charge

1633
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:29,888
Then he said the incident that led to the criminal charge occurred years ago rather than life

1634
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,680
Last year

1635
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:37,824
Totally different

1636
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,432
Finally a lot of universes where Omar Navarro

1637
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,736
Finally he acknowledged the misdemeanor

1638
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,856
Conviction but at first blamed the Orange County District Attorney's Office in the media for quotes fake news

1639
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,208
Admitting it was his own doing

1640
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
Highlights

1641
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,800
I wish it was just one interview of them being like

1642
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,872
Come on man

1643
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,176
I think it would be

1644
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,224
Alright I did it

1645
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,272
I'm bad

1646
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:23,904
So one of his initial quotes was the district attorney refused to dismiss the case it was filed under false pretenses

1647
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,208
The Daily Breeze is biased news

1648
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,512
Then a little bit later

1649
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
The afternoon

1650
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:36,192
I got what I deserved everybody makes mistakes

1651
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
At least you can own up to

1652
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:49,504
Trapped in a quarter

1653
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Child

1654
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
This guy is a

1655
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,392
You seems to be deeply entrenched

1656
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,208
Sheriff music

1657
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
And then also

1658
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,280
It really is

1659
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,816
Important the Rodger stone is one of his

1660
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
Manager campaign advisors

1661
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,680
Okay I do think it's

1662
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
Against

1663
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:12,800
Aren't there laws against Rodger Stone being involved in politics at all anymore

1664
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:16,640
Do we just write a no more Rogers don't be good

1665
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:21,760
He's allowed to give advice and be an advisor but I really think it is a strong concert

1666
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:25,600
Interest when he's essentially part-owner of Infowars

1667
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,416
He uses that as a platform

1668
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
The fundraiser

1669
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
For his candidate

1670
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,048
Think of that would probably qualify as contribution

1671
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
In kind

1672
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Now

1673
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
Thought

1674
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,680
Perhaps we should

1675
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Okay

1676
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
You and I

1677
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:45,824
Send a petition who's our who's our local representative

1678
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,104
Some random ass

1679
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
Send a bill to them like those those

1680
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,648
Sinus you don't like American Heritage Foundation and all those boxes

1681
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,440
Okay

1682
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,720
That just says

1683
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
No more Rodger

1684
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,816
With a list of Rodger Stone Behavior

1685
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,352
And if you get

1686
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
3 or more

1687
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:10,912
No more you

1688
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,936
You're out you know

1689
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,752
Just adjusted General no more Rodger Stone

1690
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:21,664
I love that you're saying this cuz you're going to fall in love with Rodger Stone all over

1691
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,992
Here's the first clip of the Rodger Stone Saga

1692
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,272
And I

1693
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
Alex Jones

1694
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,320
Scott McCall from

1695
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,208
He's very talented

1696
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:39,328
I want to have the phone tomorrow

1697
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,728
So Rodger Stones freaking out

1698
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,520
You got big news for Alex

1699
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
Now how to say this

1700
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Play music

1701
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,920
But you just heard about our know Rodger Stones belt

1702
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,968
He's not he's not a

Undisclosed location in the back room of a cigar store somewhere in South Florida

1710
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,288
Today's date

1711
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,080
Cerveza

1712
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,248
I'm freaking out the door

1713
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,040
Morton Florida

1714
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,624
Drinking Scotch smoking a Cuban

1715
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,672
Weirdo

1716
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,512
South Florida

1717
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:48,448
Alright that's almost like a boomerang

1718
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
Lacrosse

1719
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:59,968
You know I have always praised Facebook for their sophistication in the Commandments

1720
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:03,552
Target

1721
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:09,952
Effectively

1722
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,656
Crusading toe Trump state senator

1723
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:22,496
Who is Michael Douglas

1724
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
Call Georgia

1725
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,848
And his campaign

1726
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:30,432
When they do their pay promotion on Facebook

1727
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:35,040
Supporters of Infowars or Alex Jones

1728
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:42,464
Subscribers can no longer be accessed

1729
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,792
I immediately shut down my own paid

1730
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:50,656
Supporters

1731
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,424
For Alex

1732
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
I have the screen grab

1733
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,264
On all of them

1734
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,896
So funny story

1735
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
I also have a page

1736
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
Acknowledged

1737
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:07,808
Can you access Alex Jones followers

1738
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:18,560
I did everything but give them actual money until the are you sure

1739
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
Post

1740
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,680
Anything come up its

1741
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,240
And I'm not saying that Rodger Stone isn't getting that message

1742
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,824
Yeah it's I mean like I don't know

1743
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
I don't I don't

1744
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,896
Is it true

1745
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,432
Calling in for me

1746
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
The humidor

1747
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
Hi hats

1748
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,040
That's such a great way to open it and

1749
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:44,672
I'm calling from an undisclosed undisclosed location

1750
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
In the back of a cigar store

1751
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,512
Subway

1752
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:53,120
So Milo's appearance on the show and I saved you from a lot of

1753
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,240
They keep saying they're going to do an act

1754
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Because they're trying

1755
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
A parody of

1756
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
B language

1757
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,176
Liberals liberals

1758
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,736
Lever action but they don't mention what it is

1759
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,272
And then after the show

1760
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,576
Alex Winter

1761
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
On periscope

1762
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Him

1763
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,672
And Milo yiannopoulos

1764
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
No

1765
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,488
Now Google

1766
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
Okay

1767
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
I guess I'm fine with

1768
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,144
Why

1769
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,424
F*** Google

1770
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,240
Embarrassing pile of s***

1771
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
Vent for a second

1772
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,336
I'm here

1773
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:40,736
Google is no longer at like a as bad as Facebook is Google is even

1774
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,272
Is it least as bad as

1775
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
As

1776
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,832
Implicit in all of this b******* they were

1777
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
Pissed off at face

1778
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,392
The fuk Google

1779
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,720
I hope Infowars shows up at Google's offices every f******

1780
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:54,816
I hope Alex Jones just opened up a f****** office across the

1781
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,888
The street and just walked in and knocks on there I'm sure

1782
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,424
Pristine glass doors

1783
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
And there's the building.

1784
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:07,104
Did though is

1785
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,640
You lucky I we're not going to

1786
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,920
Super Big Sam's

1787
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,736
Google

1788
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
A storefront

1789
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,344
It's just like you they went to the Apple Store

1790
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:22,976
Google office

1791
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:29,632
Like Google Fiber office in Austin and I mean that's it weird

1792
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
Local Comcast

1793
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,496
We're going to get them to give us a router

1794
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,312
So I can't I have some clips

1795
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,128

1796
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
Google enjoy

1797
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904

Hilarious

1799
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,632
Milos

1800
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
Showmanship

1801
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,472
Google

01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,264

1803
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,568
The Google Fiber store Front

1804

And

1805
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,896
Aboard employees time

1806
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
Galaxy

1807
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:39,264
You can hear the stomach

1808
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:05,120
That's really what's more about my love

1809
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,288
The bell I get paid $11 an hour

1810
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:18,688
$11 an hour

1811
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
50 years old

1812
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:30,464
You guys are drunk

1813
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,488
Alex is

1814
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,048
F*** it like for me to judge

1815
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
He has red face

1816
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
He is like

1817
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
Who watched him out and about is just like

1818
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,728
Like I don't know if it's cuz he's out in

1819
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,032
Amazon or something like that

1820
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
Like

1821
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
Manatee

1822
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,152
You could call the white Apes could call the cops on white

1823
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
People the same way you do on black people they would be

1824
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,760
They would have been murdered by

1825
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,784
Ears it's really fun

1826
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,768
Before he does

1827
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
This is

1828
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,816
True comedy

1829
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,520
He's a famous band

1830
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,200
The audio shifted their head to Adonai

1831
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,480
But it starts with

1832
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,296
Who's your friend who's your friend

1833
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,624
Leave me alone

1834
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
Who's this

1835
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
About

1836
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,144
Ideas Google Fiber store

1837
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,992
They said

1838
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,608
Walls

1839
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:20,800
He gets distracted from his whole talk about his lies about Elon Musk

1840
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,576
Plants is just like some Ivy growing on it

1841
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,928
Like a fuking idiot

1842
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,328
Google

1843
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:56,384
About YouTube

1844
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:02,784
Google Fiber about YouTube to grind and is he

1845
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,112
You can go harass mother

1846
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:10,208
Like they have to have the aliens

1847
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,024
You got to have a second

1848
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,560
Who's the dude

1849
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:22,240
What's happening is go harass some low-level employees at the storefront

1850
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
Going to get them for publicity

1851
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:30,432
Because they're obviously going to get thrown out and they're going to be able to make a big deal out of

1852
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,760
Restart this but it's so poorly executed

1853
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,320
It's there's absolutely nothing here

1854
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,904
Generally speaking when you're trying to get kicked out of a place

1855
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,184
Saying I like

1856
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,520

Is a bobber

1858
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,592
That whole thing is a bummer

1859
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
I promise

1860
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
It's pretty funny

1861
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,944
Alex

1862
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,736
Suggest what Google is really up to

1863
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:07,040
Nefarious plans

1864
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,184
By the way

1865
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,744

Customer service

01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:46,784
He talks to the

1892
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:11,360
He says to the cops twice

1893
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,384
He's patronizing

1894
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
Panders to

1895
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,968
In 2009

1896
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:18,016
That's the only interaction

1897
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Somebody has a cop

1898
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,832
What's the female cop did say how are you doing mister

1899
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600
George Jones

1900
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,160
And the reason I said that nine times in the back

1901
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
But the reason she said that is

1902
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,976
Because everyone f****** knows who our

1903
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,768
She lives in Austin

1904
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:32,608
Yes kicked out of Google frequently you've done this before

1905
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:39,008
He's done the same set up Google Fiber but there was a Google open house in thrown out of

1906
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,080
The only interaction that he has with a cop

1907
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,360
Here's the chaser

1908
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:49,248
After they've left in her walking down the street now it's Jones looks like a goddamn Lobster he's so red in the face

1909
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,296
This is what he said to Rob.

1910
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,208
Exactly who you are

1911
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
Hahaha

1912
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,560
The cops were all listeners

1913
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,888
You just making that up out of whole cloth

1914
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
So every time

1915
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:12,544
Listeners response to you Alex

1916
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,592
Hey Alex

1917
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,128
Hey mr. Jones

1918
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:20,736
You got to go we are doing this again

1919
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,504
Hey

1920
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,832
Oru harassing low-level employees

1921
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,880
Never seen that before

1922
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
So

1923
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
George Jones

1924
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:33,280
This isn't a Wendy's at 3 a.m. sir please leave this calls into question

1925
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,328
I mean not that there was a question

1926
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,608
Not at all

1927
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Really should

1928
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,168
Paint every time he says

1929
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
Some people said their listeners

1930
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,288
Every time he's like I go out in public and everyone loves me

1931
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:50,176
You went up there and you were like a guy who works at Google Fiber I'm harassing

1932
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:53,248
But I think that's probably how you treat people and then

1933
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:56,832
Indicates a slight awareness of who you are like

1934
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,624
Yeah I got her listeners

1935
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,184
This is pathetic and all of it is

1936
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
This publicity stunt mentality

1937
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,512
You having Milo on

1938
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:08,864
The troll by saying that Maxine Waters is a dog

1939
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,912
And I also

1940
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:15,008
He's doing all this like lesbians are f****** stupid and have dumb haircuts

1941
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:18,336
All of it just to rile people up so they'll give him Free Press

1942
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
Because he's in a fuk

1943
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
Nothing bad play

1944
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
We recognized

1945
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,200
Is it a bad place

1946
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
Come to it

1947
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
The better

1948
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,272
We can do

1949
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,856
At this point although it is fun to learn about Omar Navarro

1950
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
Certainly

1951
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,512
For me but like

1952
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Hey

1953
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,840
Grotesque

1954
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:45,216
There are a lot of

1955
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:55,968
Only one other Jordan Bonet is in this planet

1956
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Like for us

1957
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
Come on this show

1958
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
And save that I'll expect

1959
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,832
Disgusting things

1960
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:04,672
About the state of Israel murdering Palestinian protesters

1961
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
Not

1962
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,512
I would say almost all of them on arm

1963
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
That doesn't help

1964
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,352
Obviously that's

1965
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,888
Everyone knows

1966
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,424
That's not helping

1967
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,984
And then beyond that all this other s*** is

1968
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
Trolling all this other s*** is Judge

1969
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:20,800
It's stupid

1970
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,128
Okay you're welcome Italy Ollie's

1971
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:24,896
The entire time

1972
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:25,920
Is

1973
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,688
Blaming

1974
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,456
The victim

1975
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,368
You put that you punch down in protection got punched

1976
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:40,768
I have one more thing I wanted to read about the the protest in Israel really quick

1977
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:47,168
Dino that a list of all the crimes all over Navarro's across the country have committed

1978
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,448
No

1979
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,728
This Omar Navarro

1980
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:55,104
Also did I read another article in the New York Times by I feel really bad about this but I forgot the

1981
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
The guy is

1982
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,664
Name byline

1983
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:02,016
Someone who helped to organize the protest

1984
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,064
The big March is happening

1985
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,856
I think right now we're recording

1986
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,392
The 15th

1987
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,976
Preamble to the big

1988
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,536
March 9th

1989
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:19,168
I read this article you wrote about what it meant to him and why he was organizing these protests

1990
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,448
I think it's really important

1991
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
Thought disorder thing

1992
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,008
Feed

1993
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,032
Mention

1994
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Discuss

1995
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:29,920
A couple years ago people here would have dismissed the idea the peaceful demonstrations could have tea of anything

1996
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,992
After all every other form of resistance

1997
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
Is producing nothing

1998
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:34,528
Concrete

1999
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,832
What amazes me is the transformation

2000
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,624
We're seeing in the way we resist

2001
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,416
Our struggle previously with

2002
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,208
Green arm Palestinian Fighters

2003
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
An Israeli sniper tanks

2004
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:46,048
Now it's a struggle between

2005
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,072
The occupation and

2006
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
Protesters

2007
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
Men women

2008
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
Young and old

2009
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
Still

2010
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,472
Despite the response from Israeli snipers

2011
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,520
I continue to be committed to nonviolence

2012
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,848
As are all the other people quote coordinating this March

2013
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,176
I use quotation marks because when a movement becomes this large

2014
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:06,528
Estimate to be as many as 200,000 people on Friday

2015
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,576
We cannot be completely controlled

2016
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:11,648
We can discourage the burning of Israeli Flags

2017
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:14,208
And the attachment of Molotov cocktails

2018
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,768
The kite we walk peaceful equal coexistence

2019
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:17,536
BR message

2020
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,072
We've also tried to

2021
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,632
Discourage protesters from attempting to cross into Israel

2022
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
However

2023
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,424
We can't stop them

2024
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
It's the action of

2025
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,496
Imprison people yearning

2026
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
For freedom

2027
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:28,800
Sue

2028
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:35,712
That's the voice of output that's the voice of literally one of the main people coordinating

2029
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,248
Bob these marches

2030
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
Well-put

2031
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:39,808
Alex

2032
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,600
Go fuc yourself

2033
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
Go fuc yourself

2034
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:47,488
You're a piece of s***

2035
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,536
I go seriously

01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,304
Read

2037
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Read any

2038
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,632
Look in your heart

2039
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,912
Look in your heart

2040
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:55,680
You Grinch

2041
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,216
The racial Grinch

2042
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Anyway

2043
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,080
Libertarian

2044
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:05,664
Was actually correct an acting within his capital

2045
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
Absolutely

Jesus do you want to go to knowledge

2052
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:36,640
And then six years later will create a city destroying the microorganism

2053
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:42,784
But conservative businesses

2054
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,856
I want to know

2055
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:50,720
This is everything

2056
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:57,120

Anyway

2060
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,688
Solid as a good anyway

2061
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:17,088
I like the yeti way there I want to enlist people if you have a fever if you want

2062
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,368
He does make a big difference

2063
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,928
Leave a review on iTunes

2064
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,976
A rating and review

2065
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:26,048
I would go a long way

2066
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,656
Your turn buddy

2067
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,704
It is and I know exactly

2068
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,728
Play who I

2069
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
You know what

2070
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Okay.

2071
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Alright

2072
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,664
I'm interested

2073
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:45,504
Part of me wants to save state of Israel to go f*** himself

2074
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,208
And everybody knows it

2075
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,280
