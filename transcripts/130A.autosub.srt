1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex special edition

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,128
Should have knowledge

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
What's Jones

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,016
Is there a special hook

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,088
That perhaps is not the case on other episode

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
I know a lot about Alex Jones

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,400
We don't need to do this

8
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
Can male betta

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
Start a lot of the b******* that he says

10
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
And today we are awarding or punishing our listeners one one way or the other

11
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:02,208
With a long-form episode

12
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
The entirety of Alex Jones documentary

13
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
For Global enslavement

14
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Listeners

15
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,576
Send an email to knowledge fight at gmail.com

16
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,416
And how great I am I think a listener actually suggested

17
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
I'm only taking half the blame

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,424
Birthday present for all of you assholes

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
It took me for f****** ever to research in

20
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm glad it's over

21
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
So also what time was my other we're going to run into some of things

22
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Alex Jones says that we're going to discuss

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
We have discussed on past episode

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Go to the podcast

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,136
So there might be a little bit of overlap if your regular listen to the podcast

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
Fever before but I wanted to stand alone as a thing

27
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
So I don't I don't mind a little bit so just

28
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
This is it this is our listeners this is for posterity when

29
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Run

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
This great land of ours

31
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
They will look back

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
Those two assholes got it right one time

33
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,600
Squirrel leadership it's as forthcoming

34
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah thank you very much for taking down the spider

35
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,768
We are going to try to not drink

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,144
Until late

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,752
But we will get to the booze eventually and then that's the high gear

38
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,664
Rivets for the silver part of the show that after a while

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
And then what was the last thing

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Everybody listening

41
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
There is a bibliography for ended

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Geography

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Really troubling about it

44
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
Like as a works cited

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,944
Cuz we got a situation here

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,808
In the bibliography like I'll get around to it later never filled it in

47
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,696
What's a bibliography

48
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
What you doing later

49
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Cuz they're trying to make anybody insert to your proof the Rothschilds are evil

50
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
And then the other thing is

51
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
Later about how he came up

52
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Encyclopedias but his dad

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Unfortunately I would say about a

54
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Third of the references

55
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Carta

56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Microsoft Carter Pages for like Play-Doh or whatever

57
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
That would also come with

58
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,615
12 hours of free internet

59
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
They're not online

60
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
Anymore

61
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
All over the place

62
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Also uses Wikipedia as a source of bunch

63
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Also

64
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
Sons of his own work

65
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,487
There's a ton of Infowars in prison planet that are used as work cited page

66
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
I don't believe anything ever made

67
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
I've respected more suspiciously similar to the Civil War

68
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
To Garner a healthy level of pity before we get into this

69
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Through that mud

70
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
To get to a lot of this stuff

71
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Let's jump

72
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Begin

73
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
The Alex Jones

74
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Documentary

75
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Oh man

76
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
I'm already out

77
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Countless

78
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
The New World Order

79
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Protesting

80
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
I already have to pause

81
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
By h.g. Wells

82
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
I already have to pause cuz

83
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,847
This is the New World Order

84
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
Contact I read the entire book

85
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
In order to

86
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:16,319
That's 60 seconds and already got it already off to a bad start

87
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
It turns out he was talking about was that there was a massive chain

88
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
The world

89
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
Under-educated on Durham

90
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
The problem was only going to

91
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
Who's going to necessitate

92
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Things were operated

93
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
It was just

94
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Inevitable

95
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Any hope

96
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
For most people be able to

97
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Continue living

98
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
But what Alex is doing

99
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Cutting pieces

100
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
Of the quote

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
He's reading the quote and not

102
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Mentioning

103
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
He's cut out

104
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
Deer from the actual text of HG Wells book

105
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Here

106
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
What are you cutting out

107
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Quotes

108
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
Countless people from Maharaja to millionaires

109
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Pukka sahib

110
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
The pretty lady

111
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Will hate the new world order

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Be rendered unhappy by frustration of their passions

113
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Fishing

114
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
Through its Advent and will die protest against

115
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
So what you saying here is he

116
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
Conveniently cutout

117
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Are the people who specifically h.g. Wells

118
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
Will be against this new world order of equity where people are able

119
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
To survive

120
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
These people specifically maharaja's which is

121
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
King

122
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Millionaires

123
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Lucas

124
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Which is a term

125
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
The colonialist made people call them

126
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
The British

127
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:40,031
And particularly when they colonized

128
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Which basically translated to

129
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Gentleman

130
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
And pretty ladies you know that's just turned

131
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Time for like

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Social

133
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
High class

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
Damn you got understand h.g. Wells

135
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Lady isn't just a woman

136
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
It's a term

137
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Evaru title

138
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
We are sea

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
And Alex Jones

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Should we use

141
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
I hope they die

142
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Activity

143
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
This is Smedley Butler

144
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
I'll get it to him later

145
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
No no

146
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
What it what is what is going on right now

147
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
This is cats mate Potter pure bright

148
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,215
You're good. Good lad

149
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
The potential

150
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
For the disastrous rise of misplaced power

151
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
And will protect the very word secrecy is repugnant

152
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
In a free and open

153
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Society

154
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
And we are

155
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Inherently and

156
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Historically

157
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Opposed to secret society

158
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
The United States

159
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
Or the people of the United States

160
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
Secret organizations of the world are no longer Secret

161
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
World domination

162
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Lot of tiny little bit

163
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Broadcast I'm Tucker

164
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
30 years

165
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
I'll never

166
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,143
Jim Tucker

167
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
Government

168
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
Now we can see a new world coming into view

169
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
A world in which there is

170
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Prospect

171
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
New World Order

172
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Not really

173
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,471
Bilderberg is a bad guy

174
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,799
Well I want to talk to you a little bit quickly

175
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Documentary

176
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,247
Literally everything else

177
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
Bilderberg for 27 years

178
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,719
Appointments documentary come out exactly nothing to show for it

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Real definitive

180
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Information if you really ever put out

181
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
Yeah if he hasn't like

182
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Do you have any real proof

183
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,735
It will be in this documentary and it is not one of my guiding Prince

184
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
That's probably

185
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
Cryptic about it

186
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Has some guy

187
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,303
From Europe who he doesn't know who it is who sent him a list of attendees every year

188
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
That's all that's all

189
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
I've no idea what the US every year

190
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,335
I am struggling to find the French word for deep or the French word for

191
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
For throat cuz I would have

192
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Totally tossed

193
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,039
Like a deep throw but I would have used a great

194
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
My complete lack of multiple languages

195
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Destroyed me

196
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
For publication called

197
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
Spotlight publication

198
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Is referred to as very anti-Semitic

199
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
Editorial

200
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Literally called

201
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
The defamation League

202
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
16 million-dollar defamation lawsuit

203
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
The spotlight

204
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
The charges raised by Buckley

205
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Were they constituted libel

206
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
The first one was charged that the National Review

207
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
Had promoted the right of militant

208
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Specs

209
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Deviance

210
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Doublelist

211
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Small children by publishing both sides

212
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Homosexual rights

213
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Homosexual rights

214
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Okay

215
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,015
So you understand

216
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
The judge found

217
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
That the National Review

218
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Was not promoting

219
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
Militant sex deviance

220
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Deviate

221
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Being like

222
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,239
Was bored

223
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
The second one

224
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Involved

225
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,271
Repeatedly claimed that the National Review at surrendered its editorial Independence

226
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Design Tower

227
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Through a deal with the ADL

228
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
And they found that there was no proof of that and that that cost

229
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
The power to broker deals between

230
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
Is that what they do

231
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
Are there perfume

232
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,455
Yeah but whatever yuty is it go to the ATL

233
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Get the people whenever they do this

234
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
I'm already angry where

235
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,047
Yeah I am 12 and a half hour long

236
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Yeah

237
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Need it whenever people are just like

238
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Oh yeah it's Southern Poverty Law Center deal between Iran and

239
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Secret Patriots

240
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Welch

241
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
Look at what they do

242
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Goldman Sachs

243
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Negotiating

244
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Goldman Sachs

245
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Negotiate

246
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
You're a fool man you're a fool

247
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
Boardrooms were there

248
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,823
Is the best way to screw over the Zionist like what are you doing

249
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Goldman Sachs

250
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Use vatf

251
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
So also I wanted to point this out

252
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
You can find a back pad log of Jim Tucker's writing about the Bilderberg Group

253
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Holy

254
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
It's all in G

255
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Might as well

256
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
It's just full of conversation

257
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,727
Bear Wild overwritten

258
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,823
The dialogue globalist

259
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Is there

260
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
I think it's probably a lot

261
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
I watched another documentary about a little bit late

262
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
You made it perfectly clear he's never gone

263
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Bilderberg

264
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
Every year and then chickened out.

265
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Cuz he's afraid that they're going to take him out

266
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Okay well then why are you still playing

267
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Cuz he takes

268
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
So you got it

269
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
This is why

270
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
Is ultimately an adverb

271
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Never

272
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Commitment

273
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Still f******

274
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,815
Video

275
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
George h.w. Bush

276
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,959
Right mention the New World Order and it's really really important

277
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
That people take that in its proper

278
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,383
It's really scary cuz he said the words New World Order and now everyone's afraid

279
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
But you have to understand that speech

280
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Was about how a rock hit just

281
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Invaded

282
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
That was the context

283
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,623
The speech the new world order was not about how

284
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
D-roc had just

285
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Defeated

286
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
Hulk Hogan NWO

287
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,095
Wrongly

288
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
Rockwood wws all the way

289
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
The WWF Attitude Era slogan

290
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
WWE slogan

291
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
So the new world

292
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
Pretty Club not bad not bad a result of being sued by the

293
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
Worldwide

294
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Bush was talking about

295
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
For decades the cold Ward been creating unsustainable tension between the US and USSR Wichita

296
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Improperly

297
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
The two largest powers in the group were at odds with each other and they would constantly look to face off with each other in proxy wars

298
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,943
Bush announces engaged in talks

299
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Gorbachev in Helsinki

300
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
We believe the racks aggression

301
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
And must not be tolerated

302
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,159
No peaceful International order is possible with larger States

303
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Devour

304
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
They're smaller neighbor

305
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Clearly no longer

306
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Dictator count on

307
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
West confrontation

308
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Concerted unx

309
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Digression

310
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
That is pretty funny in hindsight

311
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Anouk

312
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
A new partnership of Nations has begun and we stand today to unique

313
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Extraordinary moment

314
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
Sent you a new world order

315
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
Some sort of spooky One World Government as much as it is

316
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
The new way of things being done is

317
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Dictators can't rely on this idea that there

318
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,463
The superpowers are going to be otherwise engaged

319
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
Practice it didn't work out that way

320
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
But that was what he was talking about

321
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
I think that's important ultimately what

322
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
What is

323
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Any day

324
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
You're talking about

325
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
The New World Order of today

326
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
The world order of

327
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
World Order of yesterday

328
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
Like new does not mean it's a massive

329
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Changing of the Guard

330
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Before we used to be busy with all this s*** now we got to kill you God damn it I mean

331
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Directions over here

332
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Figured out that

333
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
We doing that

334
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
Anymore so now we have both

335
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Massive military budgets

336
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Guess what

337
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Gulf War

338
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
You do it

339
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Honor problems

340
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
With the conspiracy community

341
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Rush International Paradise as opposed to New World Order

342
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
So much easier like those terms

343
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Mixtape

344
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Situation

345
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
Find myself in mixtape

346
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Is fresh

347
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Absolutely

348
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,311
I really don't find a lot of

349
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
George h.w. Bush

350
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Was admitting to

351
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Anything along the lines

352
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
But never seen

353
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
True

354
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Council on Foreign Relations

355
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
Been a member for long time and was actually a director for some period of time I never mention that

356
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
When I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming

357
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
Series I do like this

358
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
Bilderbergers right there

359
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
What is

360
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
I'm flabbergasted

361
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
Documentary about really

362
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
You're really quick because I think that

363
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
Using Gary Hart as someone whose

364
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Pointing the finger at the bushes

365
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Is not a good way to go about

366
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
Run for president in 1988 against then-vice President George HW

367
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,168
W bush

368
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,264
I think as I recall it was when he

369
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
But it was during the time that I was when him and his wife

370
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
For separated

371
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
Really infidelity but it got really salacious so weird to go back in time

372
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,112
Those guys down the front runner on the Democratic side

373
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
100 years

374
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Incumbent VP

375
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,400
Really like he was going to Frederick

376
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
George h.w. Bush

377
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Screwed him over Royal

378
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,896
Also Bill Clinton put Gary Hart on a national

379
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Security Board

380
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,296
Is a bipartisan us Commission on National Security in the 21st century

381
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Security issues and what-have-you

382
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Sure sounds like

383
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,768
Changes were needed but no one

384
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Implemented

385
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
And then 911

386
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
The lady

387
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,544
See problem as broads

388
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
He

389
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
You probably had access to those warning

390
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Things that you know

391
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Bin Laden

392
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
Determined to strike in the US again

393
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Because in the lead-up to

394
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
September 11th

395
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
He was going around being like

396
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
And no one listened to

397
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
Well

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Osama

399
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:04,704
It's not like he was just talking and back room riddle

400
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm going to a

401
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Like I did years ago

402
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
I'm going to do it at

403
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
No one could possibly see this coming

404
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
The only thing

405
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Listen to Gary Hart

406
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
Order will fall

407
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
Will

408
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
The prettiest European guy

409
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Furious 9

410
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
This is exactly that

411
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
Less based in reality

412
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Near future

413
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Stromedy

414
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,752
So real quick Alex is about to launch into essentially just

415
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
She has nothing back

416
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,384
This is really just in speculating by what

417
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
He thinks is calling

418
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,784
Styx our dreams of the Future Vision

419
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
We just get to watch it

420
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Oh no

421
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Difference

422
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Is upon mankind

423
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Countries

424
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Every

425
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Evil individual Excel

426
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,152
Close to 80% of the Earth's population

427
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Are forced to live within highly control

428
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Beaver seen the movie

429
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Superhighways

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
Megacities and keep the population from Enoree

431
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
Dixon activity authorized

432
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
The danger zone for B

433
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,640
Prison Planet

434
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,712
Drop dumpling.

435
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,320
This is the vision of the global Elite there go

436
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Program

437
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Humanization

438
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,488
Where the signs of tyranny is law control

439
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,072
Designed to ensure the overlords Monopoly of power

440
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
Our species will be condemned future unless the masses are awakened

441
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Your plan

442
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
He said

443
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Wrote this

444
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
He wrote it

445
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
I'm sure he said nothing

446
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:59,040
Nothing except for tons of documents at all

447
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
I got to be honest I already wanted

448
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,440
Definitely shouldn't but I already want one

449
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:11,584
Kind of shut down after he's dead

450
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,912
After he started talking he was like

451
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Countries are a thing of the past

452
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
Countries I haven't really been a form of Independence

453
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,064
The family really those are forms of collections

454
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,904
I don't understand what the point that he is trying to make so far yet is

455
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Cuz it's not based on

456
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,424
No but we've already talked about this your kind of all right with that

457
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,008
Bad idea

458
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
It being in here cuz he's lying

459
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
About

460
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
Specific document

461
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Really real

462
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Right don't want

463
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Let's move forward

464
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
You be here all night

465
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Mobile

466
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Defeated

467
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
My secretive group

468
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
The Georgia Guidestones

469
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,032
Testament

470
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
Mobile Court Apartments

471
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
Population

472
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
I mean you can put anything in stone really so you know about the

473
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
The Georgia Guidestones

474
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Anymore

475
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
True

476
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,728
Built-in 1980s financing

477
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
The penis

478
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
So for those who don't know what the Georgia Guidestones

479
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,792
Which is light a bunch of a conspiracy theorist to believe that he was a Matt remote control car

480
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
No he was a rosicrucian that's what the

481
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Rosie Rosie Riveter

482
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Rose crucifix

483
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
That's about it

484
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
It's really crazy

485
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Because

486
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
It is still a mystery

487
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,440
No one really knows a lot

488
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Problem solved Mysteries

489
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
1 documentary enjoy that

490
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
No-one speculated that

491
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
A number of people have speculated that it's

492
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
Because it's in Georgia Atlanta

493
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
Call yourself

494
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,552
Starseed Buffalo

495
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Excuse me

496
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,696
Give me the idea that this secret has been not managed

497
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Be kept

498
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,048
The tablet

499
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Better setup

500
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
There are messages

501
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Not Commandments

502
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,752
Messages

503
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Arabic Chinese Russian

504
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Swahili

505
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
Write the first one is that

506
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,480
You should maintain Humanity under 500 million In Perpetual balance

507
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
And that's the only one

508
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,344
Conspiracy theorist

509
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Could you pick up some grocery

510
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Cool

511
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Be cool

512
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,560
Protect people in Fairlawn

513
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Just courts

514
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
Internally resolving extra

515
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
World courts

516
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
The common sense

517
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,528
Another one balance personal rights with social duties

518
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
So I mean it's not all like some

519
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
I'm sort of looking both ways before

520
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
A lot of members

521
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
Superbad

522
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
I talked to the Quarry people

523
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
You said that he represented organization that wanted

524
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Create Age of Reason

525
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,032
Speculated that there's two possibilities

526
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Possibilities that are possible

527
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
At all

528
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
The first is that it's a well-funded performance

529
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
That is possible

530
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
I think it could be a giant

531
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,904
People are buying into it Whatever Gets all hot and bothered.

532
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,464
Or two I think it's entirely possible

533
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
This guy going by the name Marcy Christian was

534
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,328
A front for a sort of apocalyptic group

535
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
I believe the disaster was in

536
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
I knew that this land

537
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
Georgia was not going to be flooded

538
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,568
Immediately by Rising water it was a lot of up

539
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
It is really well situated

540
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
Natural disaster

541
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,296
Everything is setup astrological

542
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
Like the different tablets or setup

543
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
To be like

544
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
Maximums and minimums of the

545
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Wobble of Planetarium

546
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Alien

547
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,328
Scooby-Doo

548
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
This is the way I would I would have sent it

549
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
If they erected this Monument to

550
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
To serve as a message to

551
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
Survivors of This Disaster that they saw coming

552
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
So that these survivors could avoid some of the things

553
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
That got us into trouble and hindered our ability to save ourselves from whatever disaster

554
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Misguided or not

555
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
I actually like this a lot more on their side I am on anybody else

556
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:07,424
The other thing about it is

557
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,008
Making a documentary that doesn't have a 37 minutes

558
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
Give me the astrology signs are and then they build a thing

559
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,456
Like that's

560
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
Trail that's got a thing for something

561
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
They don't have musical accompaniment

562
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
I'm pretty soon after the building of the Georgia Guidestones

563
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
To Elbert County Georgia

564
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
So if anybody

565
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
Yeah that's not another look

566
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
Temperature

567
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Anything

568
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,696
Nonsense like Mark Dice and Alex Jones

569
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Petition that the County Government

570
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
Government believe that

571
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Nefarious

572
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
Some sort of evil thing they could take them self

573
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
But the reality is it staying up is profitable

574
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
For both sides

575
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
Is if it went down then Alex wouldn't have this

576
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
It's good for tourism

577
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Elbert County

578
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
It works for everybody and it's interesting

579
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,880
Thought-provoking

580
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
There's no doubt it

581
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
About that

582
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Later

583
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,120
Hours

584
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:46,496
Man this is our own money

585
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
Alive

586
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
I guess I'm not doing it

587
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Jump back

588
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
In this film

589
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
Intelligence Network

590
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
The published

591
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
Special

592
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Not much

593
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
Anytime Alex credit is

594
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
He is a published on Mike's

595
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,368
Give me a name and then give me the one thing and then tell me exactly how many

596
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,208
100

597
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:45,120
Really fun publishing talk about Michael Kaufman

598
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
Information about brothers

599
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Absolute performance artist

600
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Author

601
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,336
Information about Michael Kaufman online

602
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Websites like him

603
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,136
Like Alex Jones's website is responsible for getting the word out about Agenda 21

604
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
Globalist plan to take over the United

605
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,792
Was that in one of his ecological papers

606
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Probably

607
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,376
He did so and actually some pretty deceitful ways that will get into

608
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Wildlands

609
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Get ready

610
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
Take off the sweater

611
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
I'm looking at the

612
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
What time and where six-and-a-half minutes into this

613
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,480
BoBoiBoy 2 hours and 20

614
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
This thing so it will post on infowars.com

615
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,720
I don't know I don't know

616
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,304
Kaufman have cancer

617
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Recognize that he was dying

618
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
This is like a farewell to that community

619
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,056
As a researcher in the American Paper industry I ran a multimillion-dollar research project on the effects of acid rain

620
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,384
When the results came in

621
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,944
I was told to quash my results or find a new job

622
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:08,064
That was when my eyes were opened to the fact that it was politics driving the science and not the other way around

623
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,392
Now I would say that the most likely real-life explanation

624
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Terrible job on this study

625
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,072
Because you forgot

626
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Instagram is a actual problem

627
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472
Think anybody's ever said that it's not

628
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Problem

629
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Acid rain from the sky

630
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Is not an issue

631
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,040
Acid rain causes really serious problems

632
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
2

633
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Fleming first of all just

634
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Water life-size end up

635
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,000
Killing all sorts of

636
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,864
Is daddy and how its setup I cannot find it

637
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
Can acid suit

638
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Okay now sprays Mastodon

639
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
I think more likely the story is a

640
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Not real

641
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
I think you just talk

642
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Kinship

643
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
Because

644
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
Vinings betabrand

645
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Completely unbelievable

646
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Except possibly

647
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Situation where the paper

648
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
He was working for one

649
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
Change is finding

650
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
But that doesn't make sense

651
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Because they would

652
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,096
Be more interested in what he actually

653
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Claimed to have found

654
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
Acid rain

655
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,848
No one's motivation makes sense in the story and the science

656
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,688
So I'm left to believe that the 160 left behind

657
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Farewell post

658
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
Was a big live at

659
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Makes me question any

660
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
Forest ecology

661
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
Ecosystem

662
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Vacation

663
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Dr.cox

664
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Ratification

665
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
Convention on biological diversity

666
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
The concept

667
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Been around for centuries

668
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
It's been receiving

669
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Tremendously

670
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,360
20th century George Bush the first female president

671
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,480
George Bush use a lot of his speeches implies that he really want

672
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Which we have

673
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
A universe

674
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
Who are Global type of government

675
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
In which every human being

676
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Ultimately responsible

677
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Policies

678
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
It is

679
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
A new world order

680
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,984
I don't understand what you're trying to explain

681
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Alex will try to

682
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:42,688
The world does it's a good right

683
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
I think what they're missing

684
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Is like

685
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
Dia is bad

686
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,512
And not the fact that everybody that they wanted Powers the worst person

687
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,840
Execution

688
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Conception

689
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
New World Order Westside

690
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,872
It inside

691
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
They're working right now

692
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Play for a North American Union

693
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
That's why there's a lot of people watching

694
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,928
Way to go around some fun stuff about Ron Paul

695
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,024
I just don't care what you think about that

696
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,608
Put out a newsletter

697
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
Really f***** up stuff

698
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
Here's one example

699
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
About the LA riots

700
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
You said was only restored in La when it's time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.

701
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
Virginia

702
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
HIV crisis

703
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,344
Cuz you said that

704
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
I guess that's

705
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:04,608
Relatively immigrants

706
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
How black people in general

707
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,776
There's a quote

708
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
In general.

709
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
That usually means

710
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,480
If you ever been robbed by a black teenager

711
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Roof

712
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,672
So anyway Ron Paul claims

713
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
Let her know like the Articles don't aren't sign

714
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,352
But other articles that were written

715
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Newsletter

716
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
What's a little suspicious

717
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:49,152
My assessment is that either this is him lying about what he's written in the past or a completely unacceptable level

718
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
I don't know I don't even know where that came from

719
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:09,120
Question your attention to details non-interventionism largely I

720
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
Anti-war in Pro marijuana

721
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Correct

722
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Philosophical beliefs

723
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
National Soccer

724
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
It's also the reason I

725
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,152
Very strong suggestions

726
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Security

727
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
It's really always the same

728
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Roman Empire

729
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Hitler during

730
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Binoculars

731
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,816
He's just I mean I don't even know what that means

732
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
Is just like using examples of respect

733
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
Rich people

734
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
That's proof

735
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
He's also comparing Empires and

736
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
That is what

737
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,599
Because there are benign insensitive

738
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Three examples

739
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,927
Call it

740
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:10,047
What you doing what you doing here is yourself only trying to be anti-government

741
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
Totally anti-government that's all you're doing

742
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
History always shows

743
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Conquest in Empire

744
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
Babylon

745
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
They all Empires

746
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
Those are the only ones

747
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Dominated

748
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Complex governmental systems

749
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
To control

750
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Population

751
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
Some of them were born

752
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Successful than others

753
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
One of them

754
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
Genghis Khan

755
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
Was incredibly successful you know

756
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
One of the big reasons why

757
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Allowed

758
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,175
Himself or

759
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
On Empire

760
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
To be absorbed by local population

761
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,343
And took them

762
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
To I-20

763
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
Talk about killed everybody who refused to join

764
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
Perfect

765
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,847
Other patterns of Empires

766
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Exactly like

767
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
Just be like

768
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
Where were those hats

769
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:53,983
Like that's a great hat let me put that on we're all friends imma get out of here all day

770
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
Empires emerge

771
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
For Supremacy

772
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
In class were financed

773
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Private Banks

774
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
Many of the Great money houses

775
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Hedge their bets and finance both sides

776
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
So if Alex just wants to

777
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
To save that

778
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
I like Bank

779
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
And stuff like that

780
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,199
Investment

781
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
Many of the weapons were made by

782
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Right

783
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
AltaVista

784
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Insert referee

785
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
Sophisticated intelligence gathering Networks

786
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,351
The financiers a clear Edge

787
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,191
They were slowly getting control videos

788
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,615
It was it was three paintings of a guy at a door

789
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:08,735
Just hand over there like sophisticated

790
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:13,599
Does a guy with a glass on the door

791
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
1850

792
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,463
Agents

793
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,839
Fought desperately to save his army

794
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
Napoleon

795
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
20 hours

796
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,063
Nathan Rothschild

797
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
The Rothschild family

798
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
London Stock Exchange

799
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,815
Stocks Plunge

800
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,167
Rothchilds been able to buy off the entire British

801
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,175
We talked about this a little bit in the past but I need to tell you this.

802
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,991
Being 9 minutes into Alex Jones documentary

803
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,063
Should disqualify everything else he said

804
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,111
This is unbelievably bad

805
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
So Jordan

806
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
Where

807
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,119
Professor Brian Cathcart of

808
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
University

809
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,751
He wrote a book called the news from Waterloo to breaks down exactly what happened

810
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
The Rothschild

811
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
Early information about Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo using set information

812
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
Stock market

813
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
Reduced-price

814
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Is an absolute absolute

815
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
Medicropper

816
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,047
In the summer of 1846

817
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,399
The story of how the Rothschild was physically at Waterloo

818
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
And saw the crushing of the French army first

819
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
He knew he could use this and I threw the bat

820
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
Everything we could to rush back

821
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
It would pain copious amounts

822
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Does money to a fisherman

823
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
Taking through a storm to do so

824
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
Arrive in London

825
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
24-hours before the news of

826
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
To make 20 million

827
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Same with pen name of

828
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,927
Derek Vail

829
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
The Rothschilds

830
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
Specifically in general

831
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
The pamphlet was written in 1846

832
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
Not around to deny the claims

833
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
The Lord over there yes he is known as a

834
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,199
Enemy of Nathan de Rothschild

835
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
General

836
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
He was not a fan of the Jewish population

837
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
So

838
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,671
Leaving now with Nathan who died 10 years before the sampler

839
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
What was written so possible to look at the claims

840
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
It can be proven that

841
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Absolutely somewhere else

842
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,959
Stock market crash

843
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
It seems like that would be

844
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
Really easy

845
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,711
To find out good records of the stock Miami like money is a big deal and they like to

846
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
To keep really

847
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,551
Good Records

848
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
Obsessed

849
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Grants

850
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
The show the the progress

851
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
Okay so as pieces of the story from the

852
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
The bunk the story began to change

853
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,543
Could not have been

854
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
So you get around these little Facebook

855
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
Documentary debunked

856
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Into something else

857
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,111
The evidence that people site

858
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
You know what I would call it

859
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,095
Cuz it was after the original Marathon

860
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
And it's also

861
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Myself some 5

862
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
Put that down on the board

863
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
Full site to verify this conspiracy

864
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Incredibly

865
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
There's a newspaper article

866
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
From June 20th

867
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Two days after

868
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
The Battle of Waterloo

869
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,159
Which states Rothschilds purchase isn't stock

870
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
However this is a forgery of the original newspaper

871
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
Those words do not appear in the real surviving copies of

872
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
Need Archibald

873
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Allison

874
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
1848

875
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Two years after the

876
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Pamphlet circulator

877
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,895
All European nations good for them

878
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,479
18:50 ostensibly from an American visitor to London

879
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
James Gunn

880
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,855
I'm right quote they say Michelle Rothschild has mounted a couriers

881
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
From Brussels to Austin

882
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
Fast clipper

883
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
That's at the moment something is decisive one way or the other

884
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,863
However in 1950 the diary was exposed as a hoax

885
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
Even though

886
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
Sure

887
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:36,159
Waterloo a bank employee in Paris Road Nathan a letter that said I'm in

888
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Done well in the early information

889
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
You had of the victory game

890
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
At Waterloo

891
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
Fresh air

892
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,423
Which allows us to finally put the story and its proper

893
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
Papers published in the week of Waterloo

894
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,079
First person to bring authentic news of Waterloo

895
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,151
Nathan Rothschild

896
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
Rather it was a man who would learn

897
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Belgian City

898
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,023
This guy was only identified as mistress

899
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
City of Dover

900
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
Who's telling the story

901
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,703
Who's telling the story in the morning of Wednesday the 21st of June

902
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
12 hours

903
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
For the efficient

904
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Official news

905
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Had arrived

906
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:30,687
At the end of the battle

907
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
It was published in at least

908
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
Three newspapers that after

909
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
We also know that the news report written

910
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
412b paper

911
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,951
Referred to Nathan Rothschild received a letter from

912
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
From one of his information

913
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,047
Mr. C of Dover

914
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,655
I'm passing the news on to the

915
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
That's the first thing that he did

916
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:57,823
Though this is noted before to other similar other people

917
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Who are name

918
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,639
And vilified by history

919
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
People sent letters

920
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Yes

921
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Proof

922
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
So I

923
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,647
The question is did Rothschild have time to buy stocks

924
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
And chairs

925
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,511
With this information that you've gotten from lettuce

926
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Apparently

927
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,887
But in the cymbarka does it. It could not have been enough to accumulate Holdings

928
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
Sufficient to earn the million

929
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
What about the entire Bridge

930
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
Inflationary

931
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,015
North markets double is game

932
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
Open stock prices that way

933
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
Nathan Rothschild may have done well in the purchase

934
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,695
Stocks that Rose sharply following the confirmation

935
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,767
Dwarfed by those of numerous tribal investors

936
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
Without any information

937
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Hey Bucky government securities earlier more cheaply

938
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
200 years on from the Waterloo

939
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Not much

940
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
Is Western State entail

941
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,847
It's just possible to see

942
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
Spectral elements

943
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
With belt

944
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
This is just

945
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
Of

946
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
So a guy named Bill

947
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,207
Still called the money man

948
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
Which retails the story of May

949
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,143
Bill still

950
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
That's rough

951
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
Stay real Phil

952
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Slow

953
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:36,895
So he tells the story of Nathan Rothschild manipulating the British market for his own

954
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,175
Courier

955
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Who brought him

956
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
Mission about Waterloo

957
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
Interesting Lee the only historical reference

958
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,463
I'll take a look I've read better fantasy novel names

959
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
I'll tell you her name.

960
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,143
The right lift

961
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Prince you can find for the name rough worth

962
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Contacts

963
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
Is the name of The Courier character in E90

964
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
40 Nazi propaganda film

965
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
The Rothschilds

966
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,151
Now for a net

967
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,199
Punchline

968
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:16,063
That's where is Bill Stillman from

969
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
And here's the final punchline

970
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:24,255
Alex Jones that bill still on his show multiple times

971
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,607
To the spouse

972
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,167
So also there's no major crashing

973
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
15 m p and Market

974
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:37,055
Nathan made purchases in July 1815 after a very slight dip in the market

975
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:42,687
October 18th

976
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
600000

977
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Lb worth of shares

978
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
On October 8th

979
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
Then finally sold in November 8th

980
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,415
About 40%

981
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
Course

982
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
6:30

983
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,351
It's good but it's not nearly

984
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,679
But it's not nearly

985
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,775
People present court all of that information is available you can find all of it

986
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
If this is some of the easiest

987
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
The bunk

988
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Right there

989
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:16,479
This is perpetuated three years just because of the desire to State Road 2

990
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
Still doesn't believe

991
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Probably

992
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
The gum around until the cotton gin

993
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:36,447
That other guy we learned in school

994
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Alex Jones is a repeating

995
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,287
Nazi propaganda

996
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
Congratulations

997
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
What the news of Napoleon's defeat

998
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Finally arrived

999
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
Stock sword

1000
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,927
Bridget

1001
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
And walk child

1002
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,887
Already dominant British Centerfire group even more aggressive

1003
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,263
Our troops and bureaucracy spread across the globe

1004
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
The Sun never set

1005
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Umbra tenuous hold

1006
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,199
This is really bad.

1007
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:24,063
Pretty bad

1008
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,343
And of course

1009
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,927
They're getting the interest off of the loans that they've given the various governments

1010
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
The wars that they have actually helped emulate and

1011
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Create

1012
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
Real quick I wanted

1013
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,119
They're real quick to the really put a button on what they're saying

1014
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
Make a profit off of selling

1015
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
Companies

1016
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,615
Baby

1017
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
You should probably be

1018
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:55,039
He talked about 2 yes absolutely didn't want to talk about that

1019
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,927
Like the guns do a lot of

1020
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,511
Lot of the killing part like maybe we should take

1021
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:10,655
Send

1022
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:16,799
The thing that I wanted to bring up is the effect of what they're doing is teaching this narrative wherein

1023
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,127
The two belligerent actors in a war aren't really to blame

1024
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
Thanks for manipulating them into fighting so they can be put into debt or whatever

1025
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,599
And I just want to be super clear about that

1026
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,183
This is out of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1027
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:38,047
This is other propaganda now being spread by Michael Kaufman

1028
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
On the documentary

1029
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
It would be nice

1030
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
By 19

1031
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
Sherman was a rising Force

1032
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,615
Leader Bank

1033
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
Funny both sides

1034
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Scent of insert rep

1035
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
Ali Industrial Revolution

1036
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,879
There was absolutely no reason to have World War 1

1037
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
Ideal opportunity

1038
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
4

1039
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,815
The banking cartel

1040
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,631
On June 20th

1041
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,703
Austrian Hungarian throne

1042
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,751
Franz Ferdinand

1043
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Was assassinated

1044
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,335
While traveling in a motor

1045
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,735
I was just a video of him

1046
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
I'm pausing it right here because I want you to

1047
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Take very

1048
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
Notice

1049
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Lot of hats

1050
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,791
I'll just tell you this while this picture is on screen cuz it

1051
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
It's fun

1052
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Dangerously close to

1053
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:50,751
Fezes the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is named

1054
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
We'll talk about him a little bit

1055
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Not him

1056
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
Now Alex thinks.

1057
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:00,991
Christian Bale from the this is actually a very famous

1058
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
A lot of people

1059
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:10,719
It fits this is from a book called the trigger hunting the Assassin who brought the world to War by Tim butcher

1060
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
The picture is not Gabriel

1061
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,887
It fits so well with a narrative of the desperate assassin

1062
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
The countless astorians

1063
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Reporters broadcasters and filmmakers

1064
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
Have claimed that the subjective

1065
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
It is not

1066
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,079
Subject of the picture is actually an innocent bystander

1067
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Sandra

1068
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Ferdinand bear

1069
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,431
Who is caught up in the sweep of arrest following the shooting

1070
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
This is very easy to find

1071
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
The fact that Alex Jones

1072
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
The presenting

1073
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Embarrassing

1074
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
A Serbian secret society

1075
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
Connections to French and British

1076
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
So what was that

1077
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
Star Wars theme

1078
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
Alex is only reference

1079
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,895
For this and it bibliography is the Wikipedia page for black ant

1080
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
Which is not good that. That's not going to cut it

1081
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Abscess

1082
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,063
That was responsible for

1083
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Committing regicide in the early

1084
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,927
1808

1085
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
India

1086
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Supposed you would be killed by Pirates

1087
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,631
So most of the claims that the black hand was deeply involved in the assassination

1088
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
Archduke Franz Ferdinand

1089
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
Testimony provided in

1090
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
Against

1091
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Chief

1092
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,335
Demetria jevic

1093
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,151
Historians believe was exaggerating the roll

1094
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
The Black Hand

1095
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Blade

1096
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
The death penalty

1097
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,551
He was involved with black hair

1098
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
It was like

1099
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:45,695
Conspiracy of all these people he might be able to spare himself

1100
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:51,327
Involvement in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

1101
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
They provided Gabrielle au Prince

1102
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
His accomplices with some weapon

1103
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,543
It allowed them to travel freely to Sarajevo.

1104
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,103
Every low and his crew were the ones who planned it

1105
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,663
And they were not part of some massive International conspiracy

1106
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,711
So is more like they just wanted them to buy

1107
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,831
Yeah they were motivated by hatred of the austro-hungarian Empire who'd been oppressing in

1108
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Destroying their home

1109
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
Not unreasonable

1110
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
The situation late 1800s early 1900s

1111
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
Complete mess of the Balkans

1112
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,327
Populations were not being heard by anyone in power

1113
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Story before never

1114
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
Never recently been towards the Ottoman Empire but they're over by the Oscar

1115
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
Empire

1116
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
1870s

1117
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,127
Meanwhile Serbia

1118
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
The Ottoman Empire in the late eighties

1119
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
60

1120
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
And abolished

1121
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Feudalism

1122
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:46,879
So it's that there was like a shining example of self-rule that was possible

1123
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,463
We have another that so gay

1124
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
Small town

1125
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
Fuel situation

1126
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,863
They were completely oppressed

1127
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Everyone was Miss

1128
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
Should just have been happy with

1129
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,543
What's the weather like

1130
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,359
So as I bought he thought that

1131
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Depressed musics.

1132
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
It was all because of her

1133
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
Ends up happening to folks like us

1134
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,903
School in Sarajevo

1135
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,975
In order to

1136
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
Footpath

1137
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
To get to a train

1138
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,495
In order to reach the train

1139
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
Navigation he Witness

1140
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,567
The feudal plight of all of the neighboring

1141
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
Communities with a croat Serb or Muslim

1142
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
Futile

1143
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:46,015
Exactly was connected was a result of the oligarchs the austro-hungarian

1144
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,879
Ecology met with a bunch of radicals and having witnessed the relative Freedom Sarajevo

1145
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Freezer homes from the Oscar

1146
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
If we had now

1147
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Technology back

1148
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,471
I think you would have a pretty solid podcast

1149
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
I don't I don't

1150
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,383
I don't support what he did I think assassinating a leader is still wrong

1151
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,431
But it is fascinating to look at

1152
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
Like you have one kid

1153
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
From a small town who went got radicalized

1154
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,063
Assassinated leader

1155
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
Triggered World War

1156
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,391
But ended up being still missing

1157
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
Do a second World War

1158
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:30,559
Holocaust that happened during that World War Rebels still to the present day

1159
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,095
Right it's insane

1160
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
Place by just

1161
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
Oppressing

1162
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:42,591
Population

1163
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
I think I think

1164
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
More interesting

1165
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Because

1166
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Clearly shows how

1167
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
These massive McIntosh

1168
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,087
Most likely going to wind up

1169
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Exploding

1170
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,159
Right

1171
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
It's not like

1172
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,839
Everything's going on throws little wrench

1173
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,423
Like he was

1174
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,847
Yeah holyshit

1175
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
It was just this one dude

1176
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:22,527
Pixel

1177
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Successful

1178
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
I'm in the first place

1179
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,279
It was a free-for-all or people are just running around and that was

1180
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,839
Assassinate a guy

1181
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
6 people are all f***** up except him

1182
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
Assassinate

1183
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,991
Takeaways horrors of World War 1

1184
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:59,647
There is a humorous aspect to the visual

1185
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Be exactly this

1186
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
Gotta move a lot myself

1187
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:12,959
Call Lisa

1188
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,751
So

1189
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
Speed right now

1190
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,615
This is going to be a power

1191
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
Play Nas.

1192
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
World War 1

1193
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
Super quick

1194
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,047
Neither him nor Michael Kaufman ever prove

1195
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
Specifically to

1196
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
To get countries

1197
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Sent that in control.

1198
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
Restaurant

1199
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
Just assertive

1200
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,031
Also if it was

1201
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
Because of that idea that we put everybody into

1202
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,575
Yeah we didn't have a World War 3

1203
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
More likely because

1204
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
We forgave so much debt

1205
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
German

1206
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Japanese

1207
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,255
Had a cruise over the time

1208
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
And said you know what

1209
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
You rebuilt

1210
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,215
It turns out that if you want to not fight world you don't

1211
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,287
Punish the people who

1212
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,967
Opposite happen

1213
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
Anyways

1214
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,087
Our six-and-a-half

1215
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
Is juice a fiber

1216
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:45,887
It's just when the movie turn off hours

1217
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
Rothschild control banks in Germany France England and Austria

1218
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:03,551
20 million were killed in the war

1219
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
Because of conflicts

1220
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,415
People involved never fight again

1221
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,279
They dubbed it the war to end all wars

1222
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,679
Why do they want war what worthwhile is money and power

1223
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
But secondly they want

1224
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
The League of Nations

1225
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,543
They had this in their plan

1226
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,567
All along

1227
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Consequence

1228
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:30,175
Once the war was over are about to be over that begin to formulate

1229
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,223
This idea of a

1230
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
Was never ever Harry.

1231
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,439
I also just real quick

1232
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:44,255
Committed in order to form

1233
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
No citation

1234
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
Just something that he deserting

1235
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,655
The complex world that was going on

1236
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Pre-World War

1237
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,775
And all the many factors that led to

1238
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,359
Very unnecessary World War

1239
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
Consulting

1240
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
Cuz I wasn't that sucks

1241
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,855
Also the citation

1242
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,279
Empire behind puppet governments in Council

1243
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,399
In the name of shopping all future conflicts

1244
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
They propose the country

1245
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,823
Sean Connery

1246
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
President established

1247
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,999
Woodrow Wilson

1248
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
He was basically

1249
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,583
Play college professor

1250
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Call system

1251
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,423
F*** yourself

1252
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Look

1253
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
Woodrow Wilson sucks

1254
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,287
Is insulting

1255
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Because

1256
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591
Look

1257
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
The things you can't take away from him

1258
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,247
He was the professor is professor of political science

1259
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,527
Princeton

1260
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Second

1261
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:16,415
He was the president of Princeton which is a political position from 1902 to 1910

1262
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Further

1263
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,047
He was a governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 before becoming president

1264
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,887
If the claim is that he's just a professor who got drafted to be the president

1265
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
It doesn't it doesn't match

1266
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
He has

1267
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
A political background

1268
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:33,567
Doubt with an apocryphal story about Woodrow Wilson

1269
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Campaign manager

1270
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
You look like

1271
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
President and that

1272
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:47,647
Apocryphal story

1273
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,463
Entire history of our government

1274
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
Who has no experience

1275
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,815
Serving in a publicly elected position

1276
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,447
The lead convened in Paris in 1990

1277
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,751
Many nations

1278
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:09,151
Public publicly elected official or government military

1279
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
And refuse to drink

1280
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,391
Country saw the League of Nations

1281
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Refuse to join

1282
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,255
The only countries that I can find the joint

1283
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,815
Irrelevant

1284
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,351
USSR in Germany

1285
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
And none of them were because of threats.

1286
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,495
Because of the prevailing attitude after World War 1

1287
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
Isolationism

1288
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,663
What's the word

1289
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:49,087
Oceans away from you assholes so interested in European affairs

1290
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879
United States

1291
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,231
Support this but you could do it I want to be a part of it

1292
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
French

1293
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:05,727
Do USSR Ginger

1294
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:12,127
They would be added to the league later but we're kicked out

1295
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,919
Spurge

1296
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,967
The rest of the world

1297
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
Restarting World War

1298
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,551
Of course they weren't allowed to join the League Navy

1299
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,623
When was formed after World War 1

1300
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:27,999
They were in 1926 but Hitler withdrew in 1933 shortly after he became

1301
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Nowhere that work

1302
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,351
So

1303
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,911
So if you have like an authoritarian

1304
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Right

1305
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
And he's like

1306
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
What we need to do

1307
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,055
Get away from all of these International

1308
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,847
Call Avista

1309
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,151
And we need to make sure that we are not

1310
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
In any way

1311
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
I responsible for their Acts

1312
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
Directions or anything like that

1313
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
Usually that's like

1314
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,135
Power grab and then it will eventually

1315
01:11:55,391 --> 01:12:01,535
Scenario

1316
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,935
Generally speaking

1317
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
And then you start

1318
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,055
Frustrated by the US Congress

1319
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
Walking Dead

1320
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
British intelligence

1321
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Rockefeller

1322
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,223
Shut up the Council on Foreign Relations

1323
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
In New York City

1324
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
1921

1325
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,599
The council recruited the best and brightest

1326
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
American Life

1327
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
To support the growth

1328
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,279
Lcfr State admission

1329
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,887
In favor of an all-powerful

1330
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Where do they stick

1331
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
They didn't

1332
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
There's a purpose.

1333
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Bruise on their website is very clear

1334
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,943
Council on Foreign Relations is an independent non-partisan

1335
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223

A group of diplomats financier lawyers

Concluded that Americans needed to be better prepared

1354
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
I'm stocked

1355
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
That

1356
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
There's also I'm not going to read this whole thing cuz

1357
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Super long

1358
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,775
So where did they where do they say

1359
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
No more.

1360
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,247
It turns out that they

1361
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
So I'll just want to be sure that

1362
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,111
Really scares

1363
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
Fiercely weirdos like Alex

1364
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,695
About this like destroying borders

1365
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
2006 op-ed

1366
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Website

1367
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,447
Written by the president of the council himself

1368
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,983
The basic argument

1369
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
Is as follows

1370
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
The world's Plus

1371
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Coexist

1372
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
With a larger number of

1373
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,895
Powerful

1374
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
At least partly

1375
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Corporation

1376
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
To non-governmental

1377
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,599
From terrorist groups to drug cartels

1378
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,391
From Regional and Global Institution

1379
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
And private-equity

1380
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
The sovereign state

1381
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
God is influence

1382
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Buy them for better

1383
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
As much as it is able to

1384
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,887
Monopoly power wants

1385
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,423
Enjoy by starburns

1386
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
Is being eroded

1387
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
Not by

1388
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,263
Some sort of evil tooth fairy

1389
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
Justified

1390
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Power out

1391
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
Corporations

1392
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,687
And inasmuch as we're able to communicate

1393
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,015
Better there's literally everything across

1394
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,063
The entire world and it's

1395
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
Sway from

1396
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
The power of states to

1397
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,671
Which is why countries like

1398
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
China and Russia

1399
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,743
North Korea

1400
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
To keep the outside

1401
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,447
You start to see you around the world at what other people are doing

1402
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:26,847
Or if you let your people control overseas and experience at themselves like like what happened with Gabriel open

1403
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Zachary

1404
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,455
About this idea

1405
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
Define what a lot of r

1406
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
National

1407
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
Ideas are

1408
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,135
Our notion of sovereignty must therefore be

1409
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Conditional

1410
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,695
Contractual

1411
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,023
Estate sales to live up to its side of the bargain by sponsoring

1412
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Weapons

1413
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
Mass destruction or conducting Janice

1414
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,679
Forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty

1415
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
To attack removal

1416
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Patience

1417
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,287
The Diplomatic challenge for this era is

1418
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,567
Gained widespread

1419
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
Support for principles of State

1420
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
Conduct a

1421
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151
The procedure

1422
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,431
For determining remedies

1423
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Wendy's Prince

1424
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Violated

1425
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
The goal should be to redefine sovereign

1426
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
Arrow globalization

1427
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
To find balance

1428
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,135
Queen the world is fully sovereign state

1429
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
An international

1430
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,951
System of either world government

1431
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,999
The basic ideas

1432
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Still provides

1433
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Constraint on violin

1434
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Needs to be

1435
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
Be preserved

1436
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
But the concept needs to be adapt

1437
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
World

1438
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
What's the main challenges to order

1439
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
Come from what Global Force

1440
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Do two states

1441
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
And what governments do to their stupid

1442
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,383
Rather than from what states do too

1443
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
Each other

1444
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
The very very reasonable

1445
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
Opposition

1446
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Put out

1447
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,319
Very clearly by the leader

1448
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
Of the Council on Foreign Relations

1449
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,415
Does not want to destroy State sovereignty

1450
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,231
What's a greater understanding of the world we live in

1451
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
I suppose the

1452
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,119
The question to ask after that though would be

1453
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,655
What is the logic

1454
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
That

1455
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,239
It is

1456
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
Worldstar

1457
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,311
I think it's World governance

1458
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:06,943
To some extent

1459
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Brought enough

1460
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,527
Concept that there really benign versions of it

1461
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
There's really really

1462
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
Non-intrusive

1463
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
Sovereignty sovereignty of State

1464
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Within a world

1465
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Government

1466
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
Cuz I mean but they're all kind of stupid

1467
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,887
Maybe 500

1468
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,639
I think it's time to Illinois.

1469
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,223
Are f****** rightfully we walked from

1470
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,623
Gary Indiana that motherfuker Gary stole our land immediately after he found

1471
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:51,231
Doubt that Napoleon had lost it Waterloo time we took it back

1472
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
The point night

1473
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,863
I agree with you

1474
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
Yeah it's not

1475
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Be merged

1476
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Confusion

1477
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,847
Supposed

1478
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,711
Conception is good I just don't trust any

1479
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,015
People

1480
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Usually

1481
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,367
You have a good idea

1482
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
If you have people who don't know what they're doing

1483
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Diplomat

1484
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
It doesn't

1485
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:30,143
If you have people who know what they're doing usually

1486
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,471
The problem is generally speaking

1487
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
The people who know what they're doing

1488
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,103
Usually trying to go the bad way

1489
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,431
They're the ones who are you there with knowledge

1490
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
And the people who want to help

1491
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Usually stoop

1492
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,599
Or they're being held back by too many stupid people yelling is wrong

1493
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
Ministered by a tiny

1494
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:59,583
By 1930 the promoters of War Cinema

1495
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,399
The Fabian socialists entered in London

1496
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,471
And the fascist they stood

1497
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,567
So if you understand what you just said

1498
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
He said

1499
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,919
Powerful World controlling group

1500
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:18,783
It's split into the Fabian socialist

1501
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,831
Some Europe

1502
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:25,439
Poppycock you remember the the famous

1503
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:30,047
No I don't miss this in my research

1504
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,495
These things are still working together but it's a fake split

1505
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
Publix

1506
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:49,759
It was a

1507
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,295
I can't be with my family

1508
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,879
I got to go

1509
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Iraq

1510
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:06,655
Alex's Citation for this point documentary

1511
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,983
The Fabian socialists

1512
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
A fascist

1513
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
You keep saying

1514
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,712
Guitar. It's crazy

1515
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
So irresponsible

1516
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:27,136
Graphic photos of Hitler

1517
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,464
They came from the same place is so stupid

1518
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
Knox Knox

1519
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,280
Does the Fabian Society

1520
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
Really interesting

1521
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
Babe

1522
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
Formed

1523
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,448
Splinter Group out of this group called the founder of the fellowship of New Life

1524
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
Alright that doesn't that sound

1525
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,336
It is

1526
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,688
The fellowship was an organization founded in 1883 that's not the cultivation

1527
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480
Character Annie Channel

1528
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,040
They advocated for pacifism and vegetarian

1529
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:59,392
From 1883 student go together so often

1530
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
Give me the pacifism

1531
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,792
Animals with faces

1532
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:09,120
Articulating their goal

1533
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Quote

1534
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
We recognizing the evils and Wrongs that must beset men so long as our social life is based upon selfish

1535
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,944
Above All Things by a love based upon unselfishness

1536
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,736
Love

1537
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,296
Unite for the purpose of realizing the fire

1538
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,088
Life among ourselves

1539
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,184
Enabling others to do the same

1540
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,744
And we now form ourselves into a society to be

1541
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,768
Be called The Guild

1542
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
Or Fellowship of the new life

1543
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,840
Carry out this purpose

1544
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
Might as well

1545
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:51,360
The heavy stuff going on with them

1546
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:55,968
Fellowship

1547
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Turtle transformation of the individual

1548
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
External affairs

1549
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,672
Decided to take me to start a new group to do that

1550
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,208
And that was where the Fabian

1551
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,232
Started

1552
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,512
Threats ended up being the same

1553
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
Italian fashion

1554
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:17,728
Fascism started when Benito Mussolini was kicked out of the socialist society

1555
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:22,080
Cuz he's too busy being a very very credibly National

1556
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,896
Fascism

1557
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
With that

1558
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
Nazis grew out of the German Workers

1559
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,296
Party

1560
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
She's Metacritic

1561
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
Nationalistic

1562
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:37,696
They hated the Socialist Democratic Party

1563
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,024
They thought they were fighting bolshevism and International jewelry

1564
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
Liberal organization

1565
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
Over Hitler Hitler

1566
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
The party

1567
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,008
National Socialist German

1568
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
German Workers Party

1569
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Physically harder to trick left-wing workers and

1570
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
Supporting them

1571
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,408
Most of the rides

1572
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:03,808
But people need some people are stupid or socialist

1573
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Yeah

1574
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,696
That's

1575
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,304
Amazing it still effective after all of the de bunking courses that has been done

1576
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,632
But that's the point of these groups

1577
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,704
Send the same socialism and that's not true at all

1578
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,984
Got our perfect

1579
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
Examples for why the

1580
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
It still happen

1581
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
Because

1582
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,640
The

1583
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
Smart people

1584
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,456
Who are

1585
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,992
Going all-out we're trying to

1586
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,016
Transformers

1587
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:38,624
Trying to make the world stadium

1588
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,416
Did you see how many

1589
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,976
F****** words they use to try and say that

1590
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,048
Yeah quite a few

1591
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,888
What are the Nazis describe themselves as

1592
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:54,496
Herbalife

1593
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,824
Communicate

1594
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,480
Like why can't we started

1595
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,016
Just like don't be a dick

1596
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,064
Just two minute podcast

1597
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,624
Here's my ears my mission

1598
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,928
Statements

1599
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
Before you do something

1600
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,512
Stop think for 2 second

1601
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,632
Don't do it was just put out an episode that Alex is lying

1602
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,936
Yeah

1603
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,616
National socialism

1604
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,920
For establishing a new world order

1605
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Adolf Hitler

1606
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,272
This is fun

1607
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:42,624
Citation for a quote

1608
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,952
Which they can't do cuz this is a fake quote

1609
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,096
I looked into it is absolutely a Facebook

1610
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:55,168
It's not a real quote Alex is just recording

1611
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
This is a meme

1612
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Great

1613
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
Supporters of

1614
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,360
The fascist of the United States in England

1615
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:08,480
Should be used to quickly transform

1616
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,576
All the more sophisticated

1617
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,672
Definition of socialism

1618
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,280
Asserting that though that you're not watching this

1619
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:29,216
Socialism

1620
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,032
He might not be actually starting that he might just

1621
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Be using that

1622
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,152
And you put it in the documentary he's definitely

1623
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,088
Congressional Medal of Honor winner

1624
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:53,792
An attempt by the robber Barrel to larger military open

1625
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,144
Testify Congress

1626
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,192
What's the most powerful man in the mirror

1627
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,336
Socialism

1628
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,360
United States

1629
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
I appeared before the

1630
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Congressional committee

1631
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
The highest representation

1632
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,960
I was supposed to lead an organization of 500,000

1633
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,264
Which would be able to take over the funk

1634
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
So you want to do something fun

1635
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
He smokes

1636
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Cigarettes a day

1637
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,968
It appears that he wasn't lying

1638
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:50,880
Laurel Street

1639
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:58,816
May or may not have been telling the truth about the plot to f****** murder

1640
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:05,216
And early Chipotle and put them in a ceremonial position

1641
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Actual

1642
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,640
Gold standard

1643
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:21,856
Gerald McGuire in bilge oil remembers of the American Legion

1644
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
Who hated spr

1645
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,536
They started by appealing to him because he was a veteran

1646
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,120
American Legion convention

1647
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:39,264
Mostly about how they needed to bring back the gold

1648
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,104
Veteran

1649
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Wait what

1650
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:49,504
Insisted on meeting the bank roller of their operation

1651
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,808
Robert Sterling Clark

1652
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,624
Who is the heir to be singer silver sewing machine

1653
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Fortune

1654
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
Clark was concerned about the

1655
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:59,232
Instructions

1656
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,536
Is 30 million dollars to save the other

1657
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Good math

1658
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
Let's not get mad

1659
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,592
Is particularly impressed by the Italian

1660
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,384
How are they

1661
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
Mess with government

1662
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:32,000
I get it. Took me a second to spell different

1663
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,584
That's why that's why

1664
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,632
So it was finally revealed to Butler

1665
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Seems unfair

1666
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:46,336
The real reason they were approaching him was they wanted him to lead an attachment to 500,000 veterans

1667
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,616
Washington to overthrow

1668
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Str

1669
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,200
He did not go along with it

1670
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
In their investigation the house found

1671
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296
Credible

1672
01:28:55,552 --> 01:29:00,672
But there was no evidence whatsoever that merited anything further than compelling Maguire to testify

1673
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,208
At which point he denied everything

1674
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,512
No one was charged in the house committee refused

1675
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,304
Subpoena many of the other people

1676
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,072
To be involved

1677
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:11,424
Because their involvement was based on hearsay and second-hand information

1678
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:16,288
So interesting in American history but the more you look at it the more it looks like

1679
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,312
The opposite of what Alex

1680
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
This wasn't

1681
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,480
Recurred planned by Rich business interests

1682
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:28,576
Specifically because they feared socialism and communism in the form of ser

1683
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:32,672
The reporter quotes by the f****** globalist

1684
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Well

1685
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:38,816
Fascist government of this country to save the nation from the communist

1686
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,376
Do you want to tear it down and Rec built in America

1687
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
In preparation

1688
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
For their coup

1689
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
They spread rumors that fer was death

1690
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,240
Realty

1691
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
Either pasta

1692
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Posing

1693
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,592
All in all this supposed to mean

1694
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
Is most Ramen

1695
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
Alex Jones

1696
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
A coup

1697
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
The Patriots

1698
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
To try and put Trump

1699
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,552
But the power which puts him on

1700
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,856
The exact wrong side of this

1701
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,928
Is the Maguire of This Not That

1702
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:07,744
I really find that. Like that

1703
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,304
Really interesting

1704
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,864
You know most times when you have a story like that

1705
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,424
You know gets investigated and it turns out there's nothing

1706
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:24,384
Congressional Medal of Honor he's not he's not coming out there like

1707
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,432
Alex Jones

1708
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,248
I mean Jesse Ventura was a governor of a state

1709
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
Metals

1710
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
He won the

1711
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,624
The Hell in a Cell match

1712
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
One time

1713
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,440
I don't know if you did that

1714
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,512
Fascist

1715
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,584
Edward King of England

1716
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,120
Was forced to abdicate

1717
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
Because of his public support

1718
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
For Hitler

1719
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,312
This isn't because he wanted to marry

1720
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,128
Losing American socialite has been previously divorced

1721
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:02,784
That was not allowed no Edward was the Monarch is the official head of the Church of England

1722
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:09,184
Policies that divorced people get remarried unless their spouse was

1723
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:13,792
So it would have been bigamy if the two of them would have been married in the churches eyes

1724
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
So everyone was against

1725
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,984
The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin told Edward that if he went against the public wishes Mary Wallace much of the government

1726
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,008
Resign in protest

1727
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,104
That's 1936 Edward abdicate the throne formally

1728
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,128
On June

1729
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,688
Third 1937

1730
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,760
Her divorce was finalized married Wallis Simpson

1731
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
Because you f****** loved her

1732
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,600
They stayed married till he died

1733
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,768
Is the queen or whatever it is

1734
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,704
Windsor

1735
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
After you'd actually at the

1736
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:04,992
1937-d visited Germany and met Hitler at the obersalzberg resort

1737
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,832
Buy Hitler the best interest

1738
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:09,600
Decide with a knob

1739
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:14,464
There's nothing to be gained by sitting out waiting for one side to destroy the other

1740
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
It's clearly was never a quote

1741
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,816
He took residence

1742
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,608
In France and in 1940 when the Nazis

1743
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
What was

1744
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,960
You never roast

1745
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Pro-nazi

1746
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Inclination

1747
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,776
Is horrible on its own

1748
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,312
But it wasn't the reason he had to

1749
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
To the cases because

1750
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
Situation

1751
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,432
Seems so bizarre

1752
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:38,528
That's because they love

1753
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,808
But

1754
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
That's just a

1755
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,368
That's the stupid

1756
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,392
Which is

1757
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
It's fascinating

1758
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
Look back at it

1759
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,536
Because we're not at all close to it

1760
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
Like okay

1761
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,704
He married to this girl

1762
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,984
Right

1763
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
Because

1764
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
He was divorce

1765
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,592
No she was she was divorced

1766
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
She's divorced twice

1767
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
That doesn't

1768
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
King of England

1769
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:20,768
Right

1770
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
Who gives this

1771
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,144
Is the king of England because

1772
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,168
Technically

1773
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,472
According to magical beliefs

1774
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,032
The king is also the head of the church

1775
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
About that

1776
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:39,712
The king is the head of the church getting married

1777
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,504
That's true

1778
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:46,624
Oh my God I never thought about that

1779
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,184
Circular

1780
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,976
Wow

1781
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:57,632
Yeah they would threaten with the government

1782
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,216
Hold on I think you're working something at this moment

1783
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
Furious because the

1784
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:07,104
The reason

1785
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:13,504
I want to hear that song

1786
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
Is because he wanted to

1787
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,088
Worst crimes

1788
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:20,160
The king had to step down

1789
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,096
Peace out of it which is a big

1790
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,376
Problem

1791
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,168
But

1792
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,240
Is still a good actor that out now

1793
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,288
Salt Lake

1794
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,824
Decatur

1795
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,616
Legitimately

1796
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
Beautiful

1797
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,664
Ideas

1798
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
He did love her enough

1799
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
That you like

1800
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,736
Fine

1801
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
I don't need you

1802
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
Also

1803
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,088
It's a smart idea

1804
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:56,256
It seems like the role of being

1805
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Kingwood

1806
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,840
Signing and personality was not Well Suited

1807
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,776
So to speak

1808
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
Swinger

1809
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,712
Blind

1810
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,528
Why did these people believe that

1811
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,320
If he were a Nazi he would have to

1812
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,368
Stepped out that's crazy because

1813
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,976
If he was the king and he wasn't banging

1814
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,560
Somebody who'd been divorced

1815
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:38,240
Appoint

1816
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:41,056
Like all of the all of the

1817
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,640
British royalty related to all the other rich

1818
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,432
Everywhere else royalty

1819
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
Look up.

1820
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
Control

1821
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,200
What does Flushing

1822
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:32,512
Believe the directions

1823
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:36,352
Just as they had done was Napoleon

1824
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
Oh yeah

1825
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,176
The rise and fall of the Third Reich

1826
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:57,856
True

1827
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,392
Are Fulton mirror

1828
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Barbie roll

1829
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
Public domain sea turtle

1830
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:12,704
See that's what I'm talking about this so much filler once again the elite

1831
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,496
Global governor

1832
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,056
Could save Humanity from certain destruction

1833
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
And this time

1834
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,944
The elite

1835
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,368
April 1945

1836
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,184
San Francisco

1837
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,232
United Nation was founded

1838
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:42,912
You're right complex was built in New York City

1839
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,472
On land donated by John D

1840
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:49,056
Cuz that means nothing but it's fun

1841
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,200
You and wanted to build their own City

1842
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Frazee

1843
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:05,440
I told John D Rockefeller

1844
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,000
Like a self-sustained

1845
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:14,400
That was what their plan was next weekend

1846
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,960
If we can't really do that

1847
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
Hustle

1848
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:24,384
Also like no laws apply because

1849
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:31,040
International land or whatever in the compound is not really true

1850
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,320
It's just that there's no sales

1851
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:40,768
Kill some of the UN building

1852
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
So I'm

1853
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,352
This is actually just

1854
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,704
That's something I discovered in my research

1855
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,496
Second thing I discovered to my research

1856
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,824
Is Batu the reason John D Rockefeller had this land

1857
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:56,640
It's cuz it's on Nelson Rockefeller put an option

1858
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:01,248
Because there was a guy named Williams

1859
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,856
Why is it

1860
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,880
People with regular name

1861
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:12,768
It's weird I want crazy

1862
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,096
Acres of land

1863
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:20,192
I like zeckendorf try because a good movie

1864
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
Dreyfus

1865
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,544
So he under this land is 17 acres in Manhattan

1866
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,040
You get a bill 200

1867
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
In an enclosure

1868
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:41,440
Like there's already a bad ideas and artist's rendering of it

1869
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:46,816
Craziest things I've ever seen in my life you have all these buildings

1870
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
They look like

1871
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,400
Outside the building

1872
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,424
Huge

1873
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,520
Sing everything you need

1874
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,288
Hospital

1875
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,336
Entertainment all this so you never have to leave

1876
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,640
And there was an airport on the roof

1877
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:07,296
Airplanes taking off from the middle of Manhattan 200 feet above the ground

1878
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,112
Do you have this plan this second or senior

1879
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
And he was like

1880
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,672
Is a good idea

1881
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,232
Can't afford to do that

1882
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,608
So the option on the landfill to Nelson Rockefeller was able to buy it for much less than it

1883
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:25,472
It was worse because you could end up in like 8 million dollars

1884
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
80 million

1885
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,568
Dollars

1886
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
The UN Charter

1887
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,760
It's means nothing

1888
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
Yeah

1889
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,088
You your eyes are a bit bigger than your stomach

1890
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
Great idea

1891
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,696
I would say that maybe a having the airport on

1892
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
On top

1893
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,256
Can cause a lot of noise

1894
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,584
I think there's

1895
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
At the first town meeting

1896
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:59,776
Go to Bistro

1897
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:04,128
So I'll post a picture of the

1898
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
Artist

1899
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,456
Rendering it so crazy

1900
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
F***** up

1901
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:17,184
Shortly after

1902
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:25,376
The incremental formation of Continental Subaru

1903
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:31,776
Continental was the creation of the European Union

1904
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,336
So you want to say really quick

1905
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,896
The EU was founded in

1906
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
That would have been it took

1907
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Years in order to

1908
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
To get this thing going

1909
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,296
At least started

1910
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Everyone would have been

1911
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
To the sort of thing

1912
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:50,720
The sword of unity of the coming together and

1913
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Pretty high

1914
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:57,376
Heifer heifer WWII

1915
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Bruins

1916
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,752
50 years

1917
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,800
To put these plants

1918
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:11,968
Define lateral plan of the globalist

1919
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
Nonsense

1920
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,136
The globalist

1921
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,416
Using stealth

1922
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:31,936
The Treaty of London claimed

1923
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
North America

1924
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,848
Intention was the formation

1925
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,896
European superstate

1926
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,176
You can't assert

1927
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
Things like that

1928
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:48,320
You can't know it's true insertive

1929
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
I read the whole thing

1930
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,464
It's a very completely benign document

1931
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:56,768
Such Horrors

1932
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,792
Is this

1933
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
This is very scary

1934
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:02,912
Every member of the Council of Europe must accept the principles of the rule of law

1935
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:09,312
End of the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdiction of Human Rights

1936
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,896
Y'all just going to f****** terrify you

1937
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,920
Does going to terrify you

1938
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:17,760
The aim of the Council of Europe members

1939
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,832
For the purpose of safeguarding and realizing the ideal

1940
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,392
And principles which are their common heritage

1941
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
Facilitating

1942
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
Economic

1943
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
Social progress

1944
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,048
This will be pursued through the organs of the council by discussion

1945
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,096
How questions

1946
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:38,496
And by a non economic social cultural

1947
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:44,896
Make America great again

1948
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
Course I'm going to vote for the guy who says

1949
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:54,624
Just about like we're going to create a forum where we can come together and talk about our shared

1950
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,000
Kill Everybody

1951
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,024
Pissed off whenever any

1952
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
I think that's really all.

1953
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
You f****** hate

1954
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
Bad news

1955
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,960
That's the inevitable

1956
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:11,264
Next thing that has to happen or else

1957
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,056
The other option is we all fight

1958
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,104
I don't want that

1959
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,384
Most people don't want that

1960
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
Sure seems like it

1961
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,760
Possible cycle

1962
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Get out of it this

1963
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,856
A constant infighting

1964
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:30,464
It's not if we collaborate

1965
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:33,536
Collaborate

1966
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,096
And then

1967
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,632
Where the war

1968
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Far enough

1969
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
Rabble Rouser

1970
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,312
Or like all of those guys

1971
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
Well you know what

1972
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,992
To that other side of that f****** comp

1973
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,576
And then after everybody done with that

1974
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,208
Put together build something

1975
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,488
Comfortable foramen UPS

1976
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
And then what

1977
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,840
Forgotten about those

1978
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,400
It over again

1979
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,752
Did you ever Junior High have to do like a class project with someone you didn't like

1980
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
Couldn't get anything

1981
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,312
Sing Don cuz you guys didn't like

1982
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,992
With Legos and was like

1983
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
You're good at this

1984
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:26,784
Running

1985
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
Can you start working together

1986
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
You realize that you're getting

1987
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,648
Something done together and

1988
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:36,768
All of a sudden you realize you don't actually hate this person that you're in a group project with you drove through it

1989
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,840
The world could be like that

1990
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,120
I killed Danielle

1991
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
She was from Russia

1992
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,968
Here's another quote

1993
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,784
We shall have World Government whether or not you like it

1994
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,064
Conquest or bike

1995
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,880
That does not sound real

1996
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,512
Bibliography

1997
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,560
Here Senate Foreign Relations

1998
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Committee 19th

1999
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,376
Who is the Contessa

2000
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,168
Progressive thing to say to the

2001
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,776
World Government whether or not we like it

2002
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,592
The question is only whether world government

2003
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Sensorcon

2004
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
Very different

2005
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,552
Whether or not

2006
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
Is really

2007
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,648
I read the entire speech

2008
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:41,536
He gave testify in favor of resolution

2009
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,816
Which if

2010
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
Would make a peaceful

2011
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
Transition of the United Nation

2012
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:50,752
Into a World Federation of the United States

2013
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
The passage of this resolution

2014
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,872
First prerequisite towards the development of an affirmative

2015
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,688
American policy which would lead us out of the Valley of Death

2016
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,760
See his concern was that the way things were looking

2017
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,880
The world's alliances were based on negative

2018
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
Which is to say policies that exist

2019
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
It's totally against

2020
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,256
Something as opposed to affirmative policies

2021
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
That would exist

2022
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
To support some

2023
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
And he says

2024
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:17,632
Until we establish this goal

2025
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,168
Continue to ask other people

2026
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,728
To unite with us only in the negative purpose

2027
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:22,496
Stopping Russia

2028
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,800
Beer inspired negative action makes

2029
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Pour cement

2030
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,384
That was kind of the big

2031
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
Big contract

2032
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,344
Resolution 56 goes on to the evil of the present

2033
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,880
State of international Anarchy

2034
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:43,232
It recognizes that there is no cure for this evil short of making the United Nations

2035
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,768
Universal organization

2036
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,048
Capable of enacting

2037
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:46,816
Interpreting

2038
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
And enforcing WWII

2039
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,376
To the degree necessary

2040
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
The Outlaw Force

2041
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,216
As an instrument of foreign policy

2042
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,776
It states the objective in unequivocal terms

2043
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:00,128
Warburg goes on to say that the resolution requires literally no further steps

2044
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
United States

2045
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,432
It is a broad Declaration of

2046
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,968
The purpose and nothing more

2047
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,760
Later I use question

2048
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,528
About to

2049
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,320
The subject of disarmament

2050
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,160
I enjoyed

2051
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,952
It's a good way to look at it

2052
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:20,096
I've never seen any hope disarmament or limitation of armaments by agreement between sovereign

2053
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
A state

2054
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,424
Because all of the treaties between the Sovereign Nations

2055
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,240
Anyone can break

2056
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
The result

2057
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,544
The only result

2058
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,568
Is that you give a head start

2059
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,336
W gresser

2060
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,640
Is fairly true

2061
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,136
Well I kind of

2062
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,416
Agree and disagree

2063
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,184
Agree with his

2064
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,000
Philosophy on disarm

2065
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:51,328
I get where he's coming from interesting thought

2066
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
I don't know if I would

2067
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,680
The only way to disarm

2068
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
It works

2069
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,472
Ufirst

2070
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
Exact core I-4

2071
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,264
Exactly

2072
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,568
If you want everybody to disarm themselves

2073
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,616
You have to do it first you can't be like

2074
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:07,200
Well we have now where is

2075
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
Okay Russia

2076
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,576
You get rid of get rid of

2077
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,904
Because it's so slow leaves you open to a changing

2078
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,672
The guard

2079
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
And

2080
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:27,936
The whole program

2081
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
Exactly

2082
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
System of government

2083
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,200
Open till

2084
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,272
Back to this question

2085
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,832
Tearing

2086
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
Under Secretary of State

2087
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416
Quality matters

2088
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,440
Dean Rusk had this

2089
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,256
When we turned to the United Nations and its

2090
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:55,072
Charter we're conscious of the dominant role which

2091
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,352
Support for the United Nation

2092
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,120
Has played

2093
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,400
In our foreign policy

2094
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,960
Principal

2095
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,752
To the Charter of the United Nations are

2096
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,520
In essence

2097
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,592
A summary of the foreign policy of the United American

2098
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,152
We should not underestimate the importance

2099
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,688
The fact that these principles

2100
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
So congenial

2101
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,248
Have been subscribed

2102
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,296
58 other government

2103
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,832
The world

2104
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
Principles which are

2105
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,392
Foreign policy

2106
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,928
Is a tremendous asset

2107
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
What's the United States

2108
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Careful

2109
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,024
Today also

2110
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,072
Something most people don't talk about a lot

2111
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,400
Most of the UN foreign policy is our foreign policy

2112
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,448
Anyway

2113
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,544
The Senate Foreign Relations

2114
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,848
Committee got together and they put out a report on

2115
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
December 1st 90

2116
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,944
Resolution

2117
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,480
Or two

2118
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,248
Report out

2119
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,016
High resolution

2120
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,320
Of its own

2121
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,600
That still does make

2122
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,720
Because if their foreign policy

2123
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
Willie Hayes

2124
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,328
No that's a fair point

2125
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,424
Of the foreign

2126
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,728
Create cooperation

2127
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:08,032
He likes other

2128
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,056
He likes that

2129
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,248
What was the

2130
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,528
Revolution

2131
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,296
56

2132
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,832
Which was supposed to

2133
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,392
Declare that the United Nations

2134
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:29,024
He's cool

2135
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:29,792
Senate impasse

2136
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,496
54

2137
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,568
The Bilderberg Hotel

2138
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:48,480
The Bilderberg Group

2139
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,320
It's interesting.

2140
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,600
Aforesaid

2141
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,368
Mission

2142
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,672
Steaks

2143
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:00,256
40 earrings for men

2144
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,608
Everyone should be afraid of

2145
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:11,008
In the years since 1954 the Bilderberg Group met for the first time

2146
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,848
Mostly what they talked about

2147
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,640
Attitude

2148
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,432
The prevailing attitudes of the business

2149
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,456
Leader is in

2150
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
Government officials

2151
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
The Soviet Union

2152
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,832
And then

2153
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:31,488
So it's mostly about the

2154
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,256
Three possible

2155
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,304
Behind the Iron Curtain

2156
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,608
Right

2157
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,376
The minutes of

2158
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:52,736
A North American Union

2159
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:59,136
Form the core of the global government

2160
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,976
Enforcement

2161
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,912
The Bilderberg Group consists of the heads of all the countries

2162
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,728
We're seeing a

2163
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,824
With a bunch of

2164
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,664
Build airbag

2165
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,760
Should names of organizations and stuff

2166
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
The United Kingdom

2167
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,064
What US

2168
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,112
Said us European interest

2169
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,136
Really big

2170
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,952
But it's also a sparsely populated by

2171
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
Play organization

2172
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,512
Chakra

2173
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,352
I want to talk really quick about Bilderberg and one of the arguments that Alex

2174
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:42,400
Is Central to his world

2175
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,704
And that is what they insist on operating in

2176
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
Secret

2177
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,240
He has

2178
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
The f****** articles

2179
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:50,848
He brings up he's going to flash up a couple of articles

2180
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
About them

2181
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:54,176
Microfiche

2182
01:53:54,944 --> 01:54:01,088
And stuff like that

2183
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:04,160
Where he went with Jim Tucker to Portugal

2184
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,184
Stake out the building

2185
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,464
Burger

2186
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:11,328
Yeah Jim Tucker from the beginning about to come back even come back in a big way

2187
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,352
So

2188
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,912
Jon Ronson

2189
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,240
Like followed by some

2190
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,264
Black cars

2191
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,824
It's all very very suspicious

2192
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,920
Nothing ends up happening

2193
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,200
Chickens out at the lab

2194
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:29,504
So afterwards

2195
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,040
What's the deal

2196
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,576
He got in contact with

2197
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,112
People from the Bilderberg

2198
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:42,816
September

2199
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:45,632
She ended up getting interviews with like two or three of them

2200
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:48,448
Players in the Bilderberg Group who were at the meeting

2201
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,216
Portugal

2202
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:51,008
Explain to him very polite

2203
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:53,824
Candidly

2204
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,360
That the reason that they

2205
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,128
Prefer secrecy

2206
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
Don't want reporters to

2207
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,944
Is because the p

2208
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,248
People who were there would never speak freely

2209
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:04,320
If they knew that things were going to be recorded or they were gone

2210
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Going to be released

2211
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,624
Can't have a Frank

2212
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,232
An open discussion about ideas some that might be bad

2213
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:16,352
You might be embarrassed by the idea that like I really f***** up

2214
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,936
Your own country or HP

2215
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,520
You wouldn't be able to get anything done

2216
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:25,312
That seems like a compelling

2217
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,152
Yeah I imagine for secrecy

2218
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
Apple

2219
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:33,504
Steve Jobs in every one of those like

2220
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,272
Planning meeting

2221
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,296
Had the Press

2222
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,368
We would not have as many cool Apple

2223
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:44,768
Music you had into your

2224
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,888
Career over

2225
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:55,008
Have cooked ideas being reported as

2226
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:00,128
Especially with people

2227
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,688
Sure Cuts Round Rock

2228
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:06,784
With reporters like Jim Tucker and Alex Jones

2229
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
Hobby Airport

2230
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:16,512
Yeah misrepresent

2231
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:18,560
If they were able to go off

2232
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:23,680
Spiraling down the drain of getting anything done

2233
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:26,496
I'm comfortable with that explanation

2234
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:35,200
The table are they probably also collaborating in May

2235
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:35,968
Making deals

2236
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
That are

2237
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,160
Maybe exploitative I would assume Almost 100%

2238
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,232
But it doesn't mean that they're trying

2239
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,512
One World Government

2240
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,048
That's a little bit of acid

2241
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,240
Picture of the elite power structure of the world

2242
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,776
As a giant pyramid

2243
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,848
I get it only the elite of the elite

2244
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:11,552
The group has been around until the mid-1980s rolled up in Coronavirus

2245
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,624
Starbucks in my library

2246
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:17,440
Into the late 1990s

2247
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,232
So here's an article that's

2248
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:23,584
Specifically

2249
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,912
Bridge only consisted of rare one line mention

2250
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:32,544
Put their articles about the Bilderberg Group

2251
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,128
He's showing one line but it's so stupid

2252
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:44,832
Alright he's talked about it I got a full 3-in

2253
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:47,392
Used to do

2254
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:50,464
Their Stranglehold on information Isbell into slip

2255
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:56,608
On the outskirts of the national capital today Blacklist

2256
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,144
Converged on Hotel

2257
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,680
We're private security guards

2258
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,960
Imposed

2259
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:09,920
We're about to enter a really fun documentaries most Lively portion of it okay

2260
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,688
Crazyshit

2261
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:13,760
Out of the way up top

2262
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,576
I'm glad that the last eight hours of our episode

2263
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:18,880
This is Alex

2264
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:26,304
This is where we will have to leave off

2265
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
Alex Jones

2266
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:32,704
Goes to Canada

2267
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:36,032
What's going to be there when he shows up and what sort of trouble

2268
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:37,568
Will he end up getting it

2269
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,104
You tune in tomorrow.

2270
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,152
Guys

2271
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
This is

2272
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,992
If you'd like to get to

2273
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,528
Taste of the citation

2274
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,088
For all of this

2275
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:51,392
