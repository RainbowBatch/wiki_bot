00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
Acknowledge

00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,536
Considering the altar of Selena little bit about Alex

00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan

11
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,032
Longtime listener

12
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Survivor

13
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,664
Write that long of a listener for that

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,784
It did happen quicker than that I would like to admit

15
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
Brightspot

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
I've been looking around for something

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
To fill that void

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Scratch the itch

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Some Amazing Race

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
And I think it's fix

21
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
I think it's disrespectful to travel

22
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
I also hate everybody who's on

23
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,216
Pretty much everybody sucks he's a good reason

24
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
They're pretty

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,528
Other countries and then just do basketball tricks

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,488
Third grade one of the episodes that I saw one of the challenges was they had to sew a garment

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Yes and so they were in a Garmin

28
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
Workshop and then the other one who's not doing the challenge is just doing basketball

29
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,752
Anyway

30
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
I found

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
The Australian version of Survivor of course

32
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Australian Survivor is my bright spot

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
I think it's fun

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Basically just Survivor but with Australian accents

35
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
And

36
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
None of the b*******

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
At this point of the bulshit

38
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
I've just started what years back in this

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,096
Are you on season 1 they only have a few seasons on Paramount Prime

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Placer whatever

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,704
Season 4 I think is the first season that they have

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
A couple episodes in

43
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
No twist

44
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
I think there's a hidden immunity idol but that might be it

45
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
This is

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,528
This is Australia we don't do twisty straightforward that's not a knife

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
This is the knife I found

48
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Very refreshing after the

49
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
100 different rule changes American Survivor

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
Why you don't like Survivor

51
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
It's refreshing to see people playing

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
The game that I remember

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
It being the show

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
Loosely what I remember

55
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
You at the War on Drugs released a new album

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
It's one of very good album

57
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
And two because many people are describing the War on Drugs

58
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
This is one of the best rock

59
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
Bands currently today in the description and this most recent album

60
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
Is absolutely a Willie Nelson album

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,376
What can we can we just get it cleaned take of you saying that your bright spot is the War on Drugs

62
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
My bright spot is the War on Drugs

63
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
I love incarcerating people who don't deserve it

64
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
My favorite

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
Well that doesn't need to be taken

66
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Totally out of context

67
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,784
Yeah I know it's a great album and it is 100% of Willie Nelson record it's it's

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Just a great Old Time Country album with more updated

69
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Distortion

70
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
I love it

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
This is this is continuing in your tradition of giving

72
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
Music recommendations to the folks

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399

74
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
It is so Jordan today we have

75
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007

77
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
You're torn yeah

78
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
Because there's a part of me that recognizes that

79
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Alex just lost

80
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735

You tricked me it like a motherfuker there's another part of me

89
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Cost to dig even deeper into the past

90
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm very conflicted

91
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
And I'm not sure what I'm going to do

92
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135

111
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Is an out-of-context drop from April 7th

112
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
We're following the pattern of History

113
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
I'm probably

114
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Good chance

115
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Percent chance

116
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
That I will be killed within the next 5 years

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,439
I'll say this for theatrics and I don't say this to scare you but we need to go ahead and

118
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463

126
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,511
Are we living in like a

00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
This happened there with another judge saying yeah this is

187
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,159
This is beyond ridiculous is farcical and I will let it be farcical for so long

188
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Just out of allowance on who my who the defendant is

189
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,863
I'm just not wanting to say we railroaded this guy but he has been so horoscope for so long and now is finally the time

190
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,495
Different judge different plaintiff attorneys

191
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
So like all like that so many different variables the only thing really

192
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
It's similar between them is Alex and his behavior

193
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Is that

194
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,551
I love that it reinforces my concept of

195
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
If nothing happens

196
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
Then this will happen

197
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Because of it you know

198
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
Like if you do the exact same thing in one Court in Texas

199
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,815
It will happen in another court if you do

200
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,471
We we live in such a system that works like that in our world's been so fake

201
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
For so long

202
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
That you're not yet the idea of like a

203
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
A uniform

204
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,943
Field theory of law

205
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,807
I bet there isn't one it's just like once you get to a certain point of like

206
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
I'm not playing ball takes offense

207
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
Want to give anybody like the faith of over where

208
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,863
The legal field doing Kumbaya in Ralston

209
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
You have to understand that this is when

210
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,007
When when you know you go to the Westminster dog show in like a lot of people are going to

211
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Different opinions on judges of which dog is the nice

212
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Dog or whatever

213
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,479
But if you just bring in a random mutt off the street with names like they're all going to go you what's what's going on here

214
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
Schema and when you have a

215
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,927
Defendant who comes in and injuries the court but I just like as his own personal playground or whatever

216
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
Like you're going to get the same reaction and I think I am doing some looking into like past examples of P

217
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
People got hit with default judgments

218
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Like a lot of times I think it happens to celebrities who don't want

219
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
To have the unpleasantness

220
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Judgment

221
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
So I think I think that that was his behavior kind of

222
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,063
They note falls into the same sort of like

223
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
You been researching all those cases where we're celebrities just at one point or another decide the only way to win is not playing they just

224
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Finley

225
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
Ironic situation

226
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Is he was there to play

227
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,935
Said he was trying to play whatever game he was going to play

228
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
And it was so important Vincent to the court

229
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
That that even

230
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
His behavior their it wasn't you just don't see this that much you know we we talked about it a bit of these hearings of other cases worth

231
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Under pretty egregious circumstance

232
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
But to Sia really a first

233
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Celebrity high-profile case

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
Either the default with not just a celebrity walking away

235
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Like typically they'll just

236
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Not show up yeah yeah

237
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,703
Yeah it's a bit like Alex was invited to play a game of chess and then is like way

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
What if I ate two Chutes and Ladders and shattered on your face does that is that down to the game

239
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Everything everything passed Candyland is too confusing

240
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Meatball at the same time

241
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
Remember he's doing this

242
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,095
In two different cases in two different places on toots slightly different timeline

243
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
And has to keep whatever

244
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
Whatever shell game is happening has to be cuffed up in both cases on an on a 2 to 3 months

245
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Flag timeline to stay consistent

246
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
He's not going to be able to

247
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,759
Consistency know that you have both sets of cases

248
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
And that the conduct that ended in default judgement

249
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
Was totally separate conda what happened in Texas

250
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
Totally different stuff

251
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
So much of it is they would discover stuff going on up there that's affecting their Discovery and I be like honestly I can't even breathe

252
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,895
Busy telling him about the other stuff that's going on in my

253
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
All the stuff you saw about Google analytics and all that

254
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
The final trial balances that they brought in some account did a bunch of stuff that's it

255
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
I never got a chance to talk to that

256
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
I we were done before that even happened and it's it's stunning that done if I hadn't gotten

257
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
Metallica back in September

258
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Now just because

259
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
It's fun

260
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Real

261
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
But yeah that the difference between the two cases is absolutely stunning that he has two very different styles of wall and he lost them both

262
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,991
Repeat the behavior you're saying it's different behavior that caused the default judgment but they're like

263
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Related

264
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Family

265
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
They are cousin

266
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
Epicenter of obstinate Miss kind of

267
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Yes but it isn't variety

268
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
In in in in Connecticut

269
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
Things work on a

270
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,935
Connecticut

271
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
There's a pretty high set of Demands you got to keep the briefs coming in on a really regular. They're really regimented you're showing up at monthly

272
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Status

273
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
Directions to having to work really hard to try to keep their heads above water genetic

274
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,807
In Texas you can go long periods where you're not before the court and if you're a bad litigator

275
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
You can get yourself into some Norma's holes during those periods of time

276
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,255
Didn't help also wasn't good for them either

277
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
What was what was studying about his in Texas

278
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Their transgressions are mostly just

279
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
An abject

280
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
Not even just a refusal but you didn't even show up to play kind of ideas of Discovery they didn't answer the discovery that corridor

281
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Do it and then they'd expect to show up in the next hearing and everything will be okay

282
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
In Connecticut

283
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
They actually tried to do the stuff and that's actually maybe what got them in more trouble and just took longer is that the stuff they did

284
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Was really absurd

285
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
Enso

286
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,071
The offense and disrespect in Texas was really something

287
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
But the

288
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
Absolute clown show that was what they tried to fix

289
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,495
The situation in Connecticut with maybe even worse

290
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
So they in Connecticut they demanded like

291
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
I don't know bank records and he gave them a shoe

292
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,039
Another call I can speak of his from what's in the public sweetie

293
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,647
What is stated in the bleeding from what I can gather from what is stated there

294
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Is that they work

295
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:07,071
They were asked to have their account they're QuickBooks person press the button on QuickBooks that produces the subsidiary ledgers and all the funny

296
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
For the company

297
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
And then they said here they are

298
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Debut

299
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,775
And then a little bit later on they discovered because of some weird irregularities in there

300
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,127
The important actually we printed that button then we gave it to an accountant

301
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,575
Well he said that the Figures were misleading the figures

302
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
I believe it I believe the technical term for accounting that is cooking them

303
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,399
It discloses

304
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Identify

305
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,519
Deposition weird asking the ladies

306
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
These are the files that you produced

307
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
I think so

308
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,431
The accountant

309
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
Nobody says anything

310
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
Earrings about what's what's going on in there

311
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Honestly like

312
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Again the difference between two forms

313
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
Getting him try to pull that stuff down in Texas cuz I would have

314
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,983
Your honor your honor your honor we had all of this money that was

315
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Covered in like filth and dirt

316
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
So before we gave it to you we send it to a washing machine I don't understand what the problem is he

317
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
It's a problem. I'm glad you brought that up actually because that was one of Alex's

318
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Defenses on his show

319
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Today

320
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,303
When he was responding to the the default judgement

321
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Connecticut

322
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
It was that

323
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,959
Oh they said I didn't give them bank records I gave them a spreadsheet

324
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
If they had changed

325
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
Some numbers.

326
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
I mean it look I want to make clear tutu

327
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Pittsburgh people are listening here

328
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,183
When I say that I'm reading the public records when I'm telling you about what's going on Connecticut

329
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
But but I cannot the docket

330
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,095
Describing to you about

331
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
An accountant

332
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
Going out and then making the the numbers that were misleading turn correct

333
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
That's not Pagan from the play

334
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
That's what they say

335
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,175
Vaping

336
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Between friends

337
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
I like I don't I don't know exactly what's going on

338
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
But what I do know is that the end of the day they like they just

339
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,423
Did not produce the things that the court one of them to produce and they can't do that now and now in Connecticut

340
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Forever to reach that point

341
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Because a lot of procedural safeguards

342
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
In Texas we start hanging trees outside the courthouse

343
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,223
Operation

344
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Courthouse

345
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,279
You go into like I'm in Houston got a place in a different one now but then at Austin Courthouse where he's going to be

346
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Where I grew up in Fort Bend

347
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,191
You look outside the direct window of the courthouse you are in there is a giant oak tree with a straight

348
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
You know horizontal branch

349
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
It's been trained that way

350
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
And that bike. Bread you know what that is

351
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,639
It's this weird imposing Legacy of the Texas legal

352
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
And day today today it's theirs murderers

353
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
Call me back

354
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Largely alienated and disenfranchised in and not

355
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,023
People who have the power the state of raid against them and perhaps unjust way

356
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,375
Alex Jones is going to have to spend two weeks not courtroom looking out that window

357
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
Is met you know that's a good feeling that he has to

358
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Be in that courtroom

359
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,335
Oh I believe it place to be

360
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,991
Thursday aggressive imagery all over that Courthouse it is a scary courtroom to be in

361
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Especially especially when you're in

362
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,159
Advantageous situation perhaps

363
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
I was looking into it and it's the rules

364
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Texas

365
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
Do not mistake in our that you have 14 days is that right to like

366
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
Try and get a default judgment put aside

367
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
I know you're not not quite right on that

368
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
You'd be correct

369
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
Get the idea was

370
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
He just didn't answer the lawsuit

371
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,688
I found a default judgment was entered then you found out if she's got 14 days to get up there okay

372
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
They know I wanted to feed the stew

373
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
He really has 144 can I get in Sky baseball he really only has one appellate option

374
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
4

375
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Genies default judgment

376
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
And in Texas that's an emergency appeal

377
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Known as a mandamus we have a weird name for it

378
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
And I've heard that term used a lot by sovereign

379
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Citizen

380
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
It's one of those like classical 18th century terms that like

381
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
We're only involved when ship captains were involved in

382
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Maritime law

383
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
But it but yeah so it's an emergency appeal they don't even necessarily 6:45

384
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Take it up if they don't want to

385
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
It just really stopped options Arlo

386
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
But they do get a shot at that

387
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
That not clock

388
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
Running out very quickly sure I was curious about that cuz it seems like

389
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,984
It'll be bizarre it be bizarre to me it's like

390
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
You didn't try and do some

391
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
Nothing like that entertains deal

392
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,200
I mean there is a time limit on it so he's not too great at keeping up with those

393
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
Rising 2

394
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,392
I'm going to be here on time

395
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Making a debut at a wrestling

396
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
You don't want to show up before you're cute

397
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,192
He does have a mark trial set

398
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
You sprayed to go and you do want to pull the rug out from them. Maybe I don't know

399
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
I'm cool baby something

400
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
Ellison his calculus could be that

401
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
The last time he tried to appeal

402
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,320
An adverse ruling in the house on Casey ended up owing me $25,000 for wasting my time

403
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,904
Roll the dice again go for it I'm

404
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
That hasn't

405
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
That has b-negative stimulus that might be enough

406
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
To get you. I feel like my baby not do that again I think I think the greatest irony of all is that there's a good chance Alex

407
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Wind up an illegal immigrant in Mexico

408
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,592
Goes around

409
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,176
I mean not you joke about it but but there's a place to turn you always have to be prepared

410
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Pursue assets wherever they go

411
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
I knew he wouldn't be the first person to run on their judgment like this

412
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
That's for sure I've liquidated everything and bought a

413
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Coffee Farm in Chiapas

414
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:02,560
Are you ugly picture like a kim.com situation really

415
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
Pirate Radio station are they wouldn't let him invest be closer to your John McAfee situation

416
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,264
Weathers bath salts and murdered neighbor

417
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,920
What are the things that I wanted to ask you about it cuz I think that

418
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,736
I find this fairly interesting is that like

419
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
The Texas cases

420
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,112
If I understand correctly the defendant didn't that is all Alex

421
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Right

422
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
No

423
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,976
No that is not so that's not okay

424
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
So in Texas you have

425
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Generally three defendants

426
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
Jonesing cell

427
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
And you have is two companies that are

428
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
Again at the time we follow suit

429
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
The two companies we talk

430
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Primarily

431
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Which is Free Speech Systems LLC

432
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,224
Infowars LLC all over the website as it was at that time

433
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
That company

434
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Does not

435
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Exist it's app

436
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Paper thing

437
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
Employees no Revenue no assets

438
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
As far as we can tell

439
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
The other entities that are being sued up in Connecticut

440
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
Infowars Health LLC prison

441
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Planet TV LLC

442
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Also completely paper entities totally

443
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
A detour bunch of manatees that respond off in 23

444
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,104
Teen right around the time of the divorce to try to reorganize the business none of it really seemed to take off I don't really understand why but they

445
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Put every egg in the basket and Free Speech

446
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,296
The really intermittent that's really in its Jones and Free Speech system so we have some assets personally as some of the corporate form

447
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:32,160
Everything is under Free Speech systems right I mean like

448
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Supposedly like

449
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
You can't look at a document say this is a subsidiary of

450
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
LLC

451
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,216
Cbna

452
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Instead of like a

453
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Horizontal affiliate or something like that

454
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,176
Alter ego

455
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
It's just all Alex Jones

456
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Hashem

457
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Before there's no set

458
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
Separation between Jones and his businesses or any other businesses

459
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,696
I'm sure that that's not intentional to confuse people

460
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
That organization

461
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Strategy

462
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Yeah I know it's

463
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
It's totally aboveboard business so they would never do that

464
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,496
The other defendant in our cases that is not up in Connecticut

465
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Which is just

466
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Delightful is Owen Shroyer

467
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
All right that's right

468
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Owen Shroyer

469
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,224
Is cuz he had he went on and said specific things about new huh

470
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
And went ahead and put his

471
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Now that is something I guess I didn't think about did Owen Shroyer also have a default judgment against them

472
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Oh wow

473
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Okay

474
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
I think that's the last talked about

475
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
I would say that the non rich guy getting a sub

476
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
Judgment against him is far more damaging than be very rich man getting his

477
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
What are you

478
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
What are you

479
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
What do you do do in shorter besides run his credit

480
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
But you don't you don't collect anything

481
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,112
Which I'm not sure he does

482
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
That's going to be a text

483
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Homestead exemption you can't go collect that

484
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
If if if he has any non-exempt

485
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,072
Property I don't know what it would be like I don't understand him to be a rich guy

486
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
And it really even you know most rich guys

487
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,032
A giant judgments it. I just ruined his credit never buy a car again

488
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
14 I mean

489
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
Now

490
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,392
Satisfies Jordan sense of justice

491
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
Satisfied mind sense of judgment when you asked what are you going to do to Owen Shroyer believe me the answer wasn't

492
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Ruined his credit

493
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:52,960
That was not your hope okay

494
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Possible difficulties about the

495
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
The six

496
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,848
From his ear he got in trouble

497
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
From that lets

498
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
I don't know if that was

499
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Criminal

500
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Nothing

501
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Oh my God

502
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Mega X

503
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,928
I would have I would have destroyed six fewer cup

504
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Fox if I were him

505
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,768
Flew too close to the Sun

506
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:22,144
You know it's funny when you one of the first questions you got it you got to ask the guy when you're in deposition with him

507
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
He's got an author page on Infowars

508
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
And it's like

509
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
I am its they haven't updated in the wild hinox that's like still

510
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
I am

511
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,896
Well known for my confrontations with

512
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,224
Carl the cuck and AIDS Skrillex

513
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
He most known for that

514
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,136
I'm going to see if I can change that for you

515
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,000
You did not show up for deposition correct

516
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
Thank you for that

517
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,864
His deposition right now is currently scheduled for December 3rd so that should be fun

518
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
That would be so much fun. I feel like you're not getting them before the feds do that's a good thing as you know we brought them

519
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Little concerned about that

520
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
You're putting off your deposition forever and he's got

521
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
Canning criminal indictment

522
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
Nothing is as yet

523
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
They've been

524
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
For the past

525
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Three months they just been on Infowars making noise as much as they want would not challenge not whatever they'll finally get to know God

526
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,256
Answer question

527
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
I would love

528
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,168
To see Owen have to sit like in a serious Circle

529
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Stance

530
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
With adults

531
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm at be asked like so you're the cock Destroyer huh

532
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:38,944
Just see how he divided by Childish

533
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
I just like Court stenographers happen to type in on their shorthand

534
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
Machines

535
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,512
Duck Destroyer what's

536
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,840
Very strange things that court reporters have never had to type

537
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,568
Okay you got this guy who's kind of passing himself off as a new thing

538
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
Write like he's delivering Journal

539
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
And then like in the same breath like you know after the break I go after

540
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Carl the cock or what you do whatever it is

541
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Is he taking his job seriously enough when

542
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
He's doing Carl the cuck stuff who cares

543
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Making accusations that the you know mess

544
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Casualty

545
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Surviving

546
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
Father is a CIA agent

547
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,776
Has anybody ever have any anybody taking any of this seriously

548
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,456
Yeah he's he's an interesting like sort of the middle case to because like he started in St Louis doing

549
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Like sports journalism

550
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
I thought it was going to be a Barstool guy right have some pretentious

551
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,464
About like what he's doing as being sort of journalist

552
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Irrelevant

553
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,328
Pretend the past never really worked out any only really got

554
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
Success by yelling at Carl the cuck

555
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Yeah and then Alex being like this is fun

556
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
I'm going to hire this guy

557
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
So

558
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
Came on my radar

559
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
My radar when

560
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
Oh gosh Sailor Man costume told him about Venezuela

561
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
The Red Scare

562
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,416
Yes I I that's how he liked came onto my radar is he

563
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,512
That guy and then and then like I you constantly just see videos of like

564
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
12 year old kid destroys Owen Shroyer

565
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,288
So I just thought he was a ridiculous guy and it was weird that when I got these cases

566
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
I understand a little bit so I kind of knew who was in the Sandy Hook

567
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,968
I knew that was robbed doing that whole crew and during rain all this week

568
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
But like

569
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,600
Owen Shroyer showed up and it to me was like what's like your

570
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
The comedy guide

571
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,024
He wasn't even like working for them what in that relevant. Exactly lien High School

572
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,376
Cuz you comes in 2016 feel like what he's doing these things in 2017

573
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,936
It's weird though because he becomes sort of

574
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Jones's hatchetman

575
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
He can't talk about the

576
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,616
The family specifically so he wants to talk about the family he sends Owen Shroyer

577
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Beatles video about Erica Lafferty and confronting her

578
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,576
I don't know just goes off about

579
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
I don't understand what your problem is man like Wolfgang halbig

580
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
Most reliable reporting possible in this event and I don't know why you're trying to butt heads of people were trying to figure out what happened to your mom

581
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
I think it is

582
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
I think a lot of that

583
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:47,360
Good beginner slightly motivated by trying to prove that he belongs in that

584
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
Space like that Alex Jones Infowars face has been very clearly on that path

585
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
Have like I want to please Daddy

586
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't know much so that I will never be able to buy a car again

587
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
The English guy

588
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,560
I threw him under the bus so now I can replace the English guy you know that's probably okay

589
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Yeah I like

590
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
I don't

591
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
He is an interesting case and and people aren't talking about him enough in this suit

592
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
Because he is

593
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Is June

594
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
And people don't realize that that he just

595
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,200
Got on and did those marching orders and did those things and he's just as much a part of all of this

596
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,808
Yeah it's one of the things that we've kind of looked at over the course of us

597
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,368
What's doing podcasters like who is The Heir Apparent

598
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,696
What who is the person who supposed to do this after Alex

599
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,256
Has a heart attack or

600
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,376
Phone number to report of possible ways for him to die

601
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,216
It always seemed like Paul Joseph Watson but at some point

602
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
He seemed to want to distance himself a bit

603
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,152
Kind of clearly Owen and that was a disappointing point

604
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Pretty much everybody

605
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
You know when I came on this cuz I was probably

606
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,600
Less busy saws better in touch with right-wing online media

607
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
But

608
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Like I said the last couple years too

609
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Stomach at right

610
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
No offense to you guys

611
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,448
Like for instance I haven't been keeping up and seeing what Paul Watson career looks like right now in

612
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,056
And how much it's still part of Infowars what he's trying to carve out for himself but it seem like that's what he was

613
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
Doing in some way and I

614
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,200
I figured he was going to be on the level by cabbage Pirro is going to like

615
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Eventually be that kind of figure and he started this site called Summit

616
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,672
Dotnews that was basically just like

617
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
No news

618
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Blog kind of thing

619
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
Another Gateway pundit

620
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,376
You know but I think that his mistake

621
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
Might have been getting too involved

622
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
In like some European

623
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Politics

624
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
And some British stuff like

625
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,384
Nigel farage and those folks

626
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
I think he got pretty hard in the UK

627
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
They were at least slowed him down like kind of with a speed bump

628
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Much less relevant

629
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,608
You know why we were on this case you could also see another Heir Apparent trying to develop themselves and Robert Barn to his tribe

630
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
Oh he was given an Excel

631
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah he was really giving it ago

632
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
Desperate for like online engagement and my

633
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Just to have like

634
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
The raveling

635
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,760
Clapping seals of right-wing Twitter just clap for any crappy pretends he's doing

636
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:39,392
But like the idea that you haven't able to like successfully monetize that into making yourself a star like

637
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,976
I swear it sets that your right-wing grift

638
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,816
Right now it's so easy I saw a digit not to lie completely change the subject

639
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
Alex Berenson the decoded misinfo guy had started a sub stack in the dude he's bringing in a Million

640
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,312
Any you're on that sub. Just like blogging three times a week about covid

641
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,896
Robert Barnes how can you work this card and not be like

642
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
Just that I don't know well I think

643
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:08,832
I think Barnes f***** up because he obviously couldn't make a patreon

644
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,160
And so he tried to get on locals

645
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
I think it's the name of it the Ben

646
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,512
Not bad Dave Chappelle

647
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,328
Dave Rubin and Peterson

648
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:24,448
Patreon clone

649
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,008
I don't think that's as is lucrative

650
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
There's there is something nice about how easy the right-wing grifters is how easy you should know when to quit

651
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Quit you know

652
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,480
Like if you fail within their first month

653
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
Just give up you've already failed forever exactly

654
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
Exactly

655
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,952
It was weird to see and I always wonder about that with Barnes Supply

656
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
You're hosting enforced

657
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Words that go like anymore

658
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
Decide they got some new guy likes Alyssa

659
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,224
It's not like I mean

660
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
It is like

661
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,856
And that's best of your best compelling stuff like that what do you have better than that like like

662
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:18,208
If that isn't enough for you then something must be really wrong because there's just not they have a lot on offer

663
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Are you going to just go to show

664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,120
The Infowars is Alex Jones always will be Alex Jones without Alex Jones is in no Infowars

665
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
100%

666
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Fascinating

667
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:34,080
Personality and then craziest underlies all of that nevermind

668
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,456
By fascinating personality of course you mean very well-researched information

669
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,208
Ball and some of those great debates of the 1950s and 60s were William F Buckley would get in there

670
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,096
You can't help watch Alex Jones not really feel Shades that you know of

671
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Yeah

672
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
I bet to Barnes really quick another thing as as that was all happening like him a sin

673
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
Ending in Infowars and being Alex's lawyer

674
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,920
Me and Jordan were both like

675
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Alex

676
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
He's trying to take over that's what I was thinking

677
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
He's literally watching you go down in court I mean like presiding over devoted and he loved

678
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,632
Absolutely right so you got scared

679
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,472
Why would you ever go back at the terrible idea going to finish

680
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
Hanging Tree outside

681
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,712
YouTube

682
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
It's not good if somebody who's clearly wanting to become like an on-air

683
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Personality tala is also the person

684
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,976
Who gets paid more the longer you're in

685
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,632
Working a little against purposes

686
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
And I you can never presume this about the while you presume that he's getting

687
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Paid by the hour to be important not paid by

688
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Aiden shows

689
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,944
Through all those things work I mean if yeah but if you want to diversify your Revenue stream uo

690
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Also get a TV show on top of your love practice

691
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
Is very generous

692
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
What is a good his this

693
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
You know regular lawyers

694
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:48,736
Do things the regular way even though we're like absolute Pirates and going after who we go after it like

695
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
We had when we came to these people inside yeah you're just a guy you just like

696
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,928
Send me money in crowdfunding me too

697
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,304
I accept donations in Bitcoin

698
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,120
It is strange but I guess it work

699
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Boss

700
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
That's that's

701
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:13,312
Wherever wherever there aren't slapp lawsuit laws I think he needs of these there he's the Batman

702
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,104
States that don't have slapped

703
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,432
It's really interesting because you tried to come in

704
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,784
You know I'm going to take out these slap

705
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
This is

706
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:30,720
And then like every little other thing I've ever seen him do is go to a state without a slap loan file some crazy suit against it

707
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
Hitman on Eminem panesar to the most important constitutional lawyers that has ever practiced

708
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,960
According to Alex

709
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah really

710
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,616
Antonym for the word from the from the hearings the elephant in the room is the marker and on time I yeah

711
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
The other like weird

712
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,760
Guy who's like branded himself a First Amendment lawyer who kind of came out of

713
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
I mean like it at first he was very much an anti First Amendment lawyer in a way of like

714
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Working for p*** companies to

715
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,256
Go after people were posting their p*** videos online and stuff like that

716
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
And then like

717
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,864
Switch gears off of Valley and bunch of stuff happened tonight and

718
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
You re all about that on mine

719
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,752
But then he he he switched into like I'm now First Amendment crusader

720
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
But it's it's weird how every single

721
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:22,688
Like anytime you see Miranda is involved in that like you like oh I understand what the defense

722
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Going to be like then

723
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
It's great

724
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,832
Yeah I can understand like

725
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:34,464
Okay let's say I was going to be some First Amendment defense lawyer which I'm not going to be

726
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
I would be proud to do list on my resume

727
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,608
A Nazi that I represented right

728
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Or like a cake a cake

729
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
Writing like I'm in there defending his free-speech rights

730
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Principally

731
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
Not like doing a bunch of underhanded stuff to do it but like sure

732
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,687
Maybe I'd even be proud if I have like one or two or even three Nazis or if I had

733
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:00,063
We're Nazis are five Nazis or something like that

734
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,647
Your number for Nazis is way higher than bye.

735
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,767
Weird Cavalcade of people around this guy

736
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
Through my switch about Mark and dogs get involved in these cases

737
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
Yeah

738
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
When we discovered what his professional history really is

739
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,639
When when we discover the things that he has done in his career all of a sudden like it stopped being about like this guy seems weird maybe hangs around.

740
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
And so we brought a bunch of briefing about that

741
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,903
Our courts said no marker and Ava cannot come anywhere near this

742
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
Will not happen

743
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,279
And now there is Dave actually launched an appeal on that

744
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,095
Like they understand the default judgments have been interred

745
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
They have an appeal those yet

746
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Margarita's is appealing already

747
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,287
That's important we need Mark Randazzo in the in this

748
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:58,175
But I'm going to be occupying the next bit of the parties times is that in so

749
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,575
All of that anyway I know something I'll follow this case here that's all we'll be online at the court of appeals website follow along

750
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:10,975
They're they're trying to appeal Mark Randazzo being allowed to be involved in the next stages of medical case

751
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,279
During these last stages exactly

752
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
Development

753
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
Indication Case Files you can go look at it

754
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,151
Resume your ears now we representing young man in who is that used to be in the shooter in Parker

755
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
And totally falsely

756
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,991
A ninja that a different voice

757
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
In that case longtime corporate

758
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
He's been in that case Connie Merrick towel

759
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
Is representative.

760
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
Appeared for all three years

761
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
I can enforce cases we've had

762
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Now we're up to the seventh floor

763
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,583
But in Parkland it's been just that one lawyer the entire

764
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,399
I've seen towns named like like

765
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
Historically like you've been around with Alex's stuff

766
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
For quite a while

767
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,199
And insult his name's on all that stuff so he's been around 4-H

768
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Maybe more than a decade

769
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,903
Well in the midst of the Fontaine case real recently after the default judgment since mother things went down

770
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
Eric Chou move to withdraw as counsel

771
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
And

772
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Filed a motion with the

773
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
The court saying

774
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
I Can't Tell You Why

775
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,167
Communication

776
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
I Can't Tell You Why

777
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
But my continued representation

778
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,871
Would force me to violate the Texas disciplinary rules of conduct inviolate my ethical

779
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Nobody knows what that means

780
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:39,551
Nobody has any idea what the conflict is what the unethical thing that he would be forced to do is what did he notice

781
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,135
You can speculate a million different ways Under the Sun but from attorney-client we don't know

782
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,047
And he withdrew now in the front in case they have no

783
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,007
When you say we don't know what that means I disagree we know exactly what that means we just don't know specifically what to do

784
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
Your honor and Alex requires me to wear parachute pants every time I go to the courtroom I cannot

785
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Will you do that

786
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Let me give you a like a

787
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Superba 91

788
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Right.

789
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
I don't think it is

790
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
Right like if I'm representing

791
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
And I've been representing them for three years whatever in this year

792
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,767
And then all of a sudden I realized I find out

793
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
For some reason

794
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
That that

795
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
But that client and who he suing

796
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
Is actually Somebody I Used To

797
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Wright's Lake

798
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:35,615
I'm straight or something like that

799
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,687
Like I see you when you come to me and you want us to Target

800
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
And I'm representing you suing turn

801
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,551
And then somewhere in the suit I reckon I realized

802
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
Oh s*** I used to represent Park

803
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,951
But I didn't know that because they must a different name they must have been named something different back

804
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
That could give you that would lead to the same result

805
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Right now

806
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
It is

807
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
Is you be able to disclose that

808
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,007
Because like your representation Target like that's all

809
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,591
This is something inside the relationship somebody.

810
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,175
Relationship itself and therefore nobody knows like

811
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,575
Even though it deals with that relationship you know that there's something up to go going on there

812
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
Your honor I would like to withdraw Alex just watch

813
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,487
Better Call Saul and he's got some ideas

814
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Would be

815
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,567
This client asked me to do something 6 months ago

816
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
And I thought it was all above board when it happened

817
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,967
And I recently discovered facts that say that's not above board and now it

818
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
I will need to reveal it or leave one of the two

819
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,999
So we don't know if that kind of conflict exists or not we don't know and so

820
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
It's just so

821
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
Deranged

822
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
It's

823
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,215
But that's just got to develop I think actually

824
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,311
Alex's said that that case is already he already beat that one

825
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,199
According to his public statements on his side I believe

826
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
If your lawyer quits you win right if you suck so hard your own lawyer quits the government

827
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
Like there's nothing we can do

828
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,743
Yeah what is argument

829
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Is that

830
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
That suit

831
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,399
Is against Free Speech systems kit Daniels and the company because Kate Daniels going

832
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:38,239
Alex Jones never did like pre-approved his article to get on and say something

833
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
Individual

834
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,359
Right but it's Infowars in Kate Daniels

835
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,479
Are defendants there so I was like hey I'm free but all your money is next door at the

836
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,111
The studio at Daniels

837
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,207
Independent contractor literally never met the guy before honestly have

838
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
What I hire someone named

839
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Kit

840
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Please

841
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,959
But the hiring process

842
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
After Nero is awesome

843
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,615
I think Alex would take offense to it you can't have an old-timey Western hero that are not Alex

844
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Yeah

845
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,759
I have a couple more questions I wanted to run by you if that's alright

846
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
The first one that was

847
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
This is more of a sort of like a personal

848
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Sort of sense

849
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,791
Did this come as a surprise to you seems like it did the default judgment in the kinetic

850
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
McKay's

851
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,655
No no I don't think it did

852
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,703
Okay let me put it this way

853
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
I'm no not that

854
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,543
Default judgment was coming in Connecticut price for about 3

855
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
Like that seems pretty obvious to me that that's what they were heady

856
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
Yeah

857
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
It really is

858
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,759
I'm not mr. I'm just looking behind me

859
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,087
You know what I mean like I'm I know where we've been I know where they're going

860
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
And I see the orders they're getting and I'm like

861
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
I remember being there

862
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
An insult like I know where they're going and they're just going right in our way cuz it's the same place there's nothing like you said it's nothing to different about it

863
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
It did surprise me

864
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
I guess it's what really surprised

865
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
Once they were in super hot water and check

866
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
That they didn't wise up

867
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Little bit

868
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,895
Indian change their tactics a little bit both in Texas and Connecticut

869
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,943
Damage in Texas and not have this happening

870
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
That is surprising

871
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
After the summer I

872
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
I'm not surprised

873
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
What's happening

874
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Battery app

875
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,463
Yeah I guess I guess the thing I guess you were saying was more surprising is

876
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
32 different

877
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
Sing

878
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:42,655
That got them in trouble there that then in Texas

879
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Couldn't give

880
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,823
Default judgments against them for anything then

881
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
Really give it a try

882
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,735
And so yeah I don't think I was really surprised

883
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,879
I was surprised when I didn't get it in 2019 cuz I really thought I deserved what they did

884
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Ridiculous

885
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,071
But I understood what was going on a chance on a PO begin their whatever and if they come back and they decide to go play nice

886
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Give me another chance

887
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,935
When they came back after appeal this summer and then things just were

888
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
Just a mess just

889
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
Falling apart

890
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:23,871
I knew something was up then when they had the whole thing up in Connecticut where they released the playoffs information to

891
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,943
Hillary Clinton and all the weirdness I was like

892
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
Okay like any idea this was going to go normal

893
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Is it.

894
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Somi

895
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
There's only one way it can go through the water can only roll one day

896
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,183
What weight on the show until I knew where it was going

897
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,767
Sure. I think I said that

898
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,815
Today obviously reporter

899
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Call me off the hook

900
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
I said 21 reporter

901
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
I always knew we were going to beach on

902
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,543
I just didn't think it would happen in this ridiculous

903
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,127
Bleeding a little bit that it didn't happen

904
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Actually kind of

905
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
And part of it is

906
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
That the case is so

907
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
Obviously meritorious

908
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,623
That you don't need the default judge

909
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
You don't need it

910
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
It's it's

911
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
It's ridiculous like like

912
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,631
So and when Jones has the default judgment it allows him to point back to his bag out Railroad

913
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Never found guilty

914
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,215
Yeah it is all just you know and so it does

915
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Deflect

916
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
But I think on the other end

917
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
There's the other in that it is almost kind of poetic

918
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
That

919
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:34,527
It demonstrates like what an absolute ridiculous character use that he won't even participate misu try to respect the family's ability

920
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
Have their day in court against them

921
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,207
Yeah yeah this does almost even proves our case

922
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,535
Dial

923
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,375
You can even participate in the lawsuit without being completely malicious like

924
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
Yeah.

925
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
Elevated but I am your right

926
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,799
It sucks going to be like

927
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,127
Everything's in the hand of 12 jurors and you can never plan anybody

928
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
Yeah I think I think maybe some cold comfort is that you know you can really look at those as

929
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
Sim being basically a coward

930
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
And not being willing to engage with this process

931
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
What you can only assume is probably

932
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
Keen awareness

933
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,351
Was not going to win this is going to very much loose

934
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,727
I think that masculinity and bravado is such an important thing to him and just sort of

935
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,335
Being able to look at this and be like well you couldn't even stand up and and face

936
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
Responsibility and prove yourself right

937
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:40,319
If you are if you were right the largest problem though is it seems very clear

938
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,367
To me that once the case was brought

939
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
And his lawyers actually spoke to

940
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
To him he was essentially like okay

941
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
I've lost

942
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,119
And so we managed to do is ring the end

943
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
F****** democracy out of it

944
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,727
For an extra few years

945
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,543
It's a good theory but the

946
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Problem with that is that

947
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,175
I really think the Jones was led astray by

948
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Really bad

949
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,319
Feel like some people came in and told him you are going to win

950
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:17,951
You're going to be a Larry Flynt Hero at the Supreme Court if you don't and you are going to win and we're going to vindicate

951
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,351
And they feed his own BS back to him and say Yes is all Global shows are coming I know two people who have said that to him

952
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Oman Air

953
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,983
Also please do not fill in an amount for this check

954
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
It's very interesting that

955
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,383
They have stronger Malone this idea that

956
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
He doesn't

957
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
I'm not

958
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Look

959
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
When we depose dimin some of the stuff we asking about Discovery and and I really do feel some of it was honestly yes

960
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
The lawyers

961
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
That's why we went out for the lawyers on now. Does B

962
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
But

963
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,351
I think they really did at some point the worm started

964
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,167
The turn that the only way that these lawyers could

965
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,215
Could convince him that there series of

966
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
Billiards wasn't

967
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Due to

968
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Really bad

969
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
Potentially actionable things on Jones Beach

970
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Like Mike

971
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
If if

972
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,967
You got to said Jones has the right to bring them

973
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
Malpractice if there was nothing you can do that there was malpractice

974
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
Is done in the ways case was.

975
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,719
I think we have a next chapter

976
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
The I think what

977
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
Seems to be from

978
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,095
What we see how the

979
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
Court proceeding to play.

980
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,167
Is it they convince them

981
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:34,239
But know this wasn't a result of anything that we've done wrong

982
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,543
It's because the system is rigged against you

983
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
Near the kangaroo court this is a show trial

984
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,639
I don't deserve that

985
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:45,503
From my position like from everything I can tell based on

986
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
My hours of listening to him

987
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
I don't think anyone needed to convince him of that there's a conspiracy against him

988
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
The beginning

989
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,279
He was going to win

990
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
He was really going to these Court

991
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,959
And he was going to prove himself right he was going to embarrass me and the globalist and all of that

992
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,007
I got your man

993
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Like like that

994
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Why do

995
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,919
He really did think that for a while

996
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
He was relishing

997
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
Watching me fall on my face

998
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
That was something could not wait to see happen

999
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,951
And when it didn't happen every time his attorneys came back to him and said you owe more money now you have to pay to

1000
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
We owe more attorneys fees now

1001
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,047
Then they just convince them you're getting railroaded

1002
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,863
Not that we're doing anything wrong until you're getting railroaded

1003
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,887
And then

1004
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:39,007
That's what caused him after the default judgment just feel kind of free to speak out like

1005
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Is because you just met

1006
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
J's on his show

1007
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Singing that are judge was by Cano's satanic animal with the globalist pedophile pizzagate people or whatever

1008
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
Nnn like

1009
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:55,135
Has now just done the worm turns out you now you just don't play now I'm just not participating I'm not

1010
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
A lady's people game

1011
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,511
I'm just expecting that you speak

1012
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
An absolute circus

1013
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
I don't think anything's going to happen normally Ultra

1014
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:09,471
Yeah hit his prediction today was that he's going to get default judgment in the second

1015
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Stage of the case as well

1016
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,335
But he also is claiming that he's not being allowed

1017
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
To participate

1018
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
In the

1019
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
This Wing is

1020
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
Is penalty today

1021
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,503
I'd be happy for respect whatever way he would like to

1022
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Seems like it was his choice

1023
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,511
That's the radio version of the

1024
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
Hold me back

1025
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
Hold me back

1026
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Again I'm doing

1027
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,287
Why I like to come on your show I know it

1028
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,615
Weird and I know we custom say weird stop and maybe we're a little bit

1029
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,431
Different than

1030
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
But the problem is is like

1031
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,367
Mainstream media is really bad about getting these stories wrong and they're really bad about just taking whatever they want

1032
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
And using it to this

1033
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
Do their agendas in Jonesville used at 2

1034
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
So I do like to use this kind of form to stay

1035
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
The things that are being said

1036
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,119
About the conduct of the attorneys about the conductor

1037
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
The courts

1038
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Plaintiff

1039
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,983
They're all this b******* number to true

1040
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,055
Like it's not true

1041
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,127
Yeah and it's it's so disrespectful to see a person

1042
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
Who's already gone through all these wings

1043
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:27,295
An ending now gets these orders against him and is now just like no that's that's why I said like I can't

1044
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:31,647
I have to get on here and tell you like these things that are being said by Jones out of his mouth are simply not true

1045
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,767
Well I think you're preaching to the choir

1046
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:43,167
Travel from here right like Derpy Derpy people watch this s*** and it's not just the people you think right

1047
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
My

1048
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:51,103
My words are kind of being washed a little bit and end when I go out on Tuesday if I was to go on MSNBC and try to fit

1049
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,663
What I'm trying to say there I ate would be butchered to hell

1050
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:58,783
But when I'm here with you guys I think I can save the realities of what the public rec

1051
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,135
I've had to sit by and watch him get on his show

1052
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,207
The most insane things about this case

1053
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
That it it feels liberating to be able to down

1054
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,327
Say the three things are truant

1055
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,095
This is a wreck

1056
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,631
And people will take my word

1057
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:20,031
And we definitely appreciate you being willing to offer that perspective

1058
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
And I come talk with us

1059
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
Said that means a lot

1060
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
If that's all right before we leave

1061
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,991
We were running on

1062
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,831
And I'm sure we just ramble when we go down together

1063
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,367
I was curious

1064
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,255
If there are any consequences that he might be facing in Connecticut that are different

1065
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,583
Then the possibility of what he could be facing the Intex

1066
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
If they're both Financial

1067
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
Yeah they're both Financial but I mean

1068
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
Those one difference is Texas content walls are a little bit

1069
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Horseshoe

1070
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,639
We can just send you a jail if you're an ass all too often

1071
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:04,319
Judges doing prison people from time to time when they do things that are wrong that happens less up in Connecticut

1072
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
But yeah we're basically looking at the same kinds of

1073
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
But judgments

1074
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,511
And writs of garnishment Richard attachments

1075
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,863
And just like I guess assets wrapped up in that who like okay

1076
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,703
Yeah you didn't leave the ability to Levy against the

1077
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
Corporation itself and all.

1078
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
Eichler's there's a lot of

1079
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,615
There's not a heavy-handed stuff you can do to enforce the judgment

1080
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:33,503
I mean what you've described so far though I cannot imagine the nightmare

1081
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,575
After all of the legal aspects are over

1082
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Just that like

1083
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Okay

1084
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,231
Let's a portion what it is that we need to give to people

1085
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
Through two different courts

1086
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:49,887
Through two different lawsuits through multiple plaintiff through all of this stuff

1087
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:53,983
They're going to have to find a really really evil account

1088
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,519
Stick it out of some of that s***

1089
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:04,991
And we're going to have to find some some pretty aggressive accountant some yeah yeah

1090
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
It's

1091
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:12,415
It's like CSI accounting you know what I mean like it's going to be some stuff like that and so. That'll be I mean who knows

1092
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,463
How long is The Last of course cuz you get out early

1093
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
Burdick

1094
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:21,631
And so we'll have to see where that goes there's not always thought he go to the Supreme Court have some great First Amendment

1095
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,191
Knocking how dare you

1096
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
You can go up at 8

1097
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
I wasn't that

1098
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Disrespectful like I was

1099
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
That much of a contemptuous

1100
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
That's never going to work so you really don't have an appeal

1101
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,247
You're right

1102
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,599
That we when you talk about like always champagne time yeah when you have both sets of cases

1103
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
Default

1104
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,439
And therefore you know it's neither of them was a fluke they're not get no return

1105
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
Yeah

1106
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
The turkey done

1107
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,351
It feels like the appeal Avenue he could have would be like

1108
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:59,007
Taking it to the Supreme Court whether or not people can have default judgments

1109
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
Legal concept that seems like

1110
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
Possible thing for him to engage in

1111
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
And I don't think he would win that

1112
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
No not mean like why would you at that point I mean it's some point you're going to

1113
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
Close up shop and figure out gas

1114
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:15,903
Pouring good money after bad so I don't know what's going to happen

1115
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
Cricket you know I want to say that

1116
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,023
The only thing I know is we're going to go to his trial

1117
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:29,215
I don't know I might just be a piece of paper

1118
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:34,079
Well Alex has sworn that he's going to keep going no matter what

1119
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,175
Even if he loses all his money he will continue the Infowars

1120
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,223
And I look forward to that

1121
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,039
I look forward to the possibility of us having

1122
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,855
More high-tech skills

1123
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
That would be fun

1124
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
Overnight

1125
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,023
Thank you so much for joining us I think we should

1126
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
She probably every we've been

1127
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
I feel like it's been about an hour and a half

1128
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,751
Longer than I anticipated but I've had a great time too

1129
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,615
Play the whole hour like

1130
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,407
You want to let the paper on my

1131
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Patron but

1132
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,295
I think our audience particularly likes long episodes oh yeah so

1133
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
I have no problem with that

1134
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:21,183
They they yell at me when it's a fit when they stop having episodes that were like 3 hours long

1135
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,231
I don't know

1136
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
They're weirdos

1137
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:29,119
Thank you so much my Facebook this is an ongoing thing we got to keep it up

1138
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
I can't wait for the next update

1139
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Bobbitt we'll figure it out

1140
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Alright

1141
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Have a good one

1142
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,311
Alright now that the 1998

1143
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
And

1144
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,151
Conversation with Mark Bankston

1145
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,479
I feel like I'm an emotional place where I can actually get to this

1146
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
I'll do it

1147
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
We'll talk about

1148
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
About November 5th

1149
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,719
I think you have to leave the studio I don't think you have that I think you're just too mad to talk about that the crew

1150
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:00,095
Yeah we start here on the 15th and Alex's

1151
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
Concerned that

1152
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Patriots

1153
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Getting jammed up

1154
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
Except for Kyle Rittenhouse

1155
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
SWAT team

1156
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,223
Being denied trial by jury

1157
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,807
Being imprisoned this is the weaponization

1158
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Sherry

1159
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,159
In this country there still

1160
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:28,767
I'm honorable people in the Judiciary like you're sitting in the Kenosha

1161
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
Actually doing a fair trial

1162
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,727
Poros control Jones Austin Texas and

1163
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
Connecticut

1164
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Corruption

1165
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
Mafia level organized

1166
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
Just just

1167
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Sweet lawlessness

1168
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
Here's a great example of

1169
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,623
Overhead shot please

1170
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
November

1171
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,279
Associated

1172
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Brush

1173
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
Jones loses lawsuit over Sandy Hook

1174
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
Oak conspiracy

1175
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Yeah

1176
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,959
I wonder why he chose those

1177
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Two specific

1178
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,823
Cities for where the globalist have really taken over

1179
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
I don't know

1180
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Rodger

1181
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
Some of the examples

1182
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,991
Of the Patriots were getting jammed up or pretty fun to cuz it

1183
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,039
It's James O'Keefe

1184
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,623
And

1185
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
True

1186
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
Steve Bannon getting indicted

1187
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
I just think that's really funny that Alex

1188
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,351
Steve group cuz he hates

1189
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:43,519
Basically called for his death I mean who's not calling for anybody's death these days

1190
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:49,919
I had it at such a traitor

1191
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,479
That he definitely didn't do that I said he did

1192
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:56,319
I'm so Furious that he stole in the name war room.

1193
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:02,207
But also he's a great man standing up to the globalist

1194
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:06,303
Very confusing but whatever you have to do in order to make your own Vicks

1195
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,399
Jim Hood being in our losing these cases by default

1196
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,959
I have to fit into a larger narrative in

1197
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
That's a perfect way to do it

1198
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,335
So Alex's

1199
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
He didn't actually lose the

1200
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
These cases

1201
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Which is 4

1202
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,711
Play the sidelines of the associated

1203
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
Rush

1204
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Jones loses lawsuit over Sandy Hook

1205
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
Conspiracy

1206
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
Now what really happened

1207
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Just came out

1208
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
Again

1209
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
Now it's

1210
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
November

1211
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
Default there but before I show you this

1212
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
What's happening in Connecticut

1213
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
Father of Sandy Hook victim

1214
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,383
When's defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones

1215
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
That's from

1216
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
2000

1217
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,599
Did I lose the suit

1218
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,695
Elementary School

1219
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,303
Klamath shooting ever happen

1220
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Goes on to say I've lost the suit

1221
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,263
Contacted AP they said suicide we're not changing

1222
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,919
That's the level here if anyone wants to understand what's going on against Infowars that we deal

1223
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:33,087
MarketWatch headliner was Associated Press 100 times

1224
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
If your list

1225
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
Cling to this let me see if this is the tone you're getting

1226
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,559
There are headlines that I lost these cases

1227
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
Is now writing the present

1228
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,887
Right but also

1229
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,447
They've lied about me losing cases in the past

1230
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,519
So maybe this is meant to sort of implied

1231
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,799
They're lying now

1232
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,639
Right and I lose the cases they've lied about the cases before

1233
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,455
That feels like the only interpretation

1234
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,015
That you could have to him bringing up this

1235
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
Other headline

1236
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
Discuss

1237
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:10,975
The current headline mean I guess the other thing that he's trying to say is that it's like a propaganda thing

1238
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:15,327
To make you feel like he's a loser or something I have no idea what he

1239
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
Are you saying other than

1240
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Maybe I want

1241
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Yeah

1242
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,519
That's the sense I get which makes it so confusing when he immediately

1243
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Says this

1244
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,151
Contacted AP they said suicide we're not changing it

1245
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:35,807
Level what's going on

1246
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
This didn't happen

1247
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
The singing Texas

1248
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
The thing in Connecticut

1249
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
Wait what

1250
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:53,215
Why'd you bring it up I don't understand what the point is here sometimes they like maybe I didn't leave the floozies

1251
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,567
They did not lie I lost these f****** case

1252
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,591
Got to be honest

1253
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:04,223
They're straight-up I lost be

1254
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
I just was soaking

1255
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,087
Confused by like what even are you trying to get at here

1256
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
I can usually suss out like what

1257
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
The point is

1258
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,231
It is almost like a nervous tick like he just has to

1259
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
To bring up some

1260
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:20,863
Whataboutism that was the only thing that came to mind or something

1261
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,447
Map to be a roadblock

1262
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:30,335
Send a text with Alex discusses the default judgments like the other ones he's been

1263
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
Subject to auto repair

1264
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Guilty

1265
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:39,551
Hookah

1266
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
No

1267
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,623
Show me somebody doesn't show up

1268
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
Position

1269
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
I was reading the news for you

1270
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
California

1271
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
The judges just do that

1272
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
Yeah we know you should do

1273
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,551
I need a source on this

1274
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
Democrats in California

1275
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:24,351
Alex's correct that diesel judgments are uncommon but

1276
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,655
Because most people accept their responsibility to

1277
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,703
To take part in legal proceedings

1278
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:35,359
Society typically like if you are innocent you want to be able to have your day in court before you're innocent

1279
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
Absolutely

1280
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
Is there a Tetra sure

1281
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
If your

1282
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,711
Guilty

1283
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,551
I guess probably don't want to go to court but you have a responsibility to

1284
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
If you don't go to court

1285
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
Sure

1286
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
I guess just

1287
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,023
I mean I guess dragging your feet was an option for murder cases all alone

1288
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,607
Even though this is rare as it's not like

1289
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Beautiful drug

1290
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Never happy

1291
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,239
And Alex should be super were this and his buddy John McAfee had a

1292
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,591
The default judgment against his neighbor in Belize who was murdered

1293
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:13,247
Forcing people judgment is one of the preferred strategies of high-profile people who don't want to have to engage with the legal system and civil case

1294
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
Like R Kelly and Cuba Gooding

1295
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Junior dip

1296
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,623
It's not hard to think that Alex's

1297
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
Refusing to cooperate with the discovery process

1298
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,487
Because he is something he really doesn't want to be

1299
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,815
Like the exact nature of his finances or sources of fun

1300
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,911
There's probably a good chance he knew he was going to lose these cases if they ever want

1301
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
To try also

1302
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,751
Lose anyway why not protect your business secrets

1303
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,847
And simultaneously create a situation where you can claim you weren't actually found guilty

1304
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
This is a good

1305
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
PR strategy

1306
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,455
But it probably won't matter

1307
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,759
And it doesn't affect the real world

1308
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,063
He's going to be on the hook for so much money

1309
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
And it's already too late

1310
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
Generally for him

1311
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
To do all that much about it

1312
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,231
He might be able to get some kind of

1313
01:10:55,487 --> 01:11:00,607
Appeals going but that's not going to go anywhere he spent the last

1314
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
For years dragging this out

1315
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
So much so that people

1316
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,215
Went through it

1317
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
Entire f******

1318
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
President

1319
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Ticket

1320
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,311
I'm really interested to see what happens

1321
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,359
Throughout this case

1322
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,663
Pretty much all of his legal Avenues are exhausted

1323
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,991
And like we talked with Mark like there's the possibility that he

1324
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
He could like

1325
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
Want to challenge the validity of

1326
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Default judgment share but I don't

1327
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,439
I think that would work I think it's a waste of time and honest

1328
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Leslie

1329
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
Like

1330
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
I don't know

1331
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,327
I like who would be in favor of that

1332
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
I mean

1333
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,399
From what I understand

1334
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,775
Appellate judges are somehow even more

1335
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,335
Unconcerned with human life than most other.

1336
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
I just feel like

1337
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,943
I'm getting two two judges in two different states

1338
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,015
Having to send them cases that they default judge

1339
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:59,231
I need to wait another three years for me to handle

1340
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
It seems incredibly unlikely

1341
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,095
My process is going to be fun to watch

1342
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:04,863
Or at least into

1343
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
So Alex has something really gross now

1344
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,335
Is it dealing with the system trying to

1345
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
Kill the first

1346
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,063
What happened

1347
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,183
You don't know what really happened

1348
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,743
You think about Sandy Hook you think about the name

1349
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
Brainwashing

1350
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,263
That's such a disgusting expression of Alex's out of

1351
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,287
Control narcissism

1352
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,103
Like how dare he be so self-centered that he thinks

1353
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
When you hear the word Sandy Hook

1354
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
The first thing you think of it

1355
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Miss him

1356
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,039
I study for Alex for a living and he's not even the first thing I think of when I think of Sandy Hook

1357
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,343
He's just an absolute monster who can't

1358
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,671
Experience anything in life unless it revolves around himself

1359
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
It honestly kind of makes me sad

1360
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,279
Because ultimately what you end up realizing is

1361
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,119
But there's a fair amount of people in the world who base their political beliefs on what they

1362
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,911
I think is researched information

1363
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,239
But it's really just a product of Alex's Moody narcissistic helper

1364
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Yeah and that's

1365
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Really a bummer

1366
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:22,687
Yeah I mean that millions of people have allowed their reality to be shaped by a narcissistic out of

1367
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,991
Control Manchild is probably bad

1368
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Yeah

1369
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
But have you considered what would it be like if everybody was rational and reasonable I mean obviously if everybody was rational

1370
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,951
We would be murdering each other in the streets

1371
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Should be a lot more boring

1372
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,303
If we everybody was rational

1373
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
It's definitely true

1374
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
But

1375
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
That sucks

1376
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,423
Cuz you know what you

1377
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
Pick up when you think of Sandy Hook

1378
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
Complete tragedy of the event

1379
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,103
You don't think about Alex Jones

1380
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
And him having the

1381
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,431
The gall to say I don't really know what happened

1382
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
At this point in time

1383
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,367
A lot of people have told you very specifically what happened there oh yeah you got very wrong oh yeah

1384
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
Laudable

1385
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,767
The prediction about the next

1386
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:13,119
Phase of his trials now that he's lost all of them by a default

1387
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,215
And he can make this prediction come true on his own

1388
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,007
Decide

1389
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
Default

1390
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
We're going to double default

1391
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,247
They're going to double default

1392
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,783
And not even let me be at the

1393
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
Child decide how guilty

1394
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Is a joke

1395
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,183
Kangaroo trial if we oughta show trial

1396
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
Call a ridiculous fraud

1397
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
What are they going to be freaked out

1398
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Spent more money

1399
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
Fighting this

1400
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
I'll probably ever

1401
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,895
The CEO of Pfizer

1402
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,431
Came out and said that

1403
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,503
People talking bad about the vaccines are working for

1404
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:08,415
What do you do with this commercial commercial sound like you're drunk

1405
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,303
Another commercial I just woke up

1406
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:22,239
3 in the morning is recording on the f****** self

1407
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,359
I'm also I know for a fact that you have a standing invitation

1408
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Into that courtroom

1409
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:34,527
Creepy voice

1410
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
I think about it

1411
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:40,415
He's eating my ears Dan I'm wearing headphones

1412
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
I want to see

1413
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
Getting double defaulted in the

1414
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,887
It's going to be his fault if he does

1415
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:56,287
The trial is about determining what is a fitting Financial penalty and if Alex doesn't cooperate with discovery on this

1416
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,567
But like by refusing

1417
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
Turn over the appropriate financial documents

1418
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,175
F*** around and get another default judgment

1419
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:08,319
If he cooperates though and nothing has every ability to use every opportunity to

1420
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
Can shut down Alex's show except

1421
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:15,487
Himself and he can talk big all he wants but I have absolutely zero doubt that he

1422
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
He would quit

1423
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,303
If you didn't have the flashy Studio

1424
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,839
The weird pill line that he runs

1425
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,399
Himself the ability to travel wherever you want

1426
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Buy things like

1427
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:28,543
The ability to pay a staff together headlines for him and work out all the technical aspects of the show

1428
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,359
He would quit in a second if you didn't have those

1429
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:37,503
You'd be losing essentially all of the things that allowed to pretend to be a legitimate show and sets him apart from any

1430
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,039
Dumbass whole on YouTube

1431
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Who makes videos about vaccines are evil

1432
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:45,183
He beat a washed-up guy wet his time and he didn't get anything done

1433
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463
The hungry Young Buck

1434
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Conspiracy theorist

1435
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
To probably resent him

1436
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,303
I'm trying to take up space in their world

1437
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,607
Siphoning off a tension and possible donations

1438
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
They could be going to them

1439
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
Personally I hope

1440
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,983
He does continue to do the show even if he goes broke just

1441
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,519
Because someone who watches

1442
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,567
Is the show I think he'll be a fascinating narrative Arc

1443
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:07,455
I don't think it's going to happen though I don't think Alex has the humility to go back to being a DIY guy absolutely

1444
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,759
Imagine trying to do it by himself

1445
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
Makes me think of Steve

1446
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,207
Pieczenik and how his wife has to turn on the record

1447
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,511
Computer for I was if I was wreck

1448
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
And I was looking at the looking

1449
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,327
The tea leaves

1450
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:28,447
Cuz I be like I got to get out of here otherwise I am going to be working on Infowars 2.0 with

1451
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,983
My f****** dad for the rest

1452
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
This is my life. I need my inherited it now

1453
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,431
Being handed out

1454
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,735
Yeah I eat I think

1455
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,551
I do agree

1456
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,855
Can stop his show except for himself

1457
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,647
It's just a matter of

1458
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
You know what you're willing to

1459
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,999
Except sure

1460
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
Doing things

1461
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Ford no money

1462
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,095
Are you willing to accept

1463
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
Are you willing to knock

1464
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:02,495
Be able to grandstand the way that you do but I don't think he is I just I think he's

1465
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
And you have to figure you know it

1466
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
If he loses that

1467
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,407
Status goes right back down to the bottom tier

1468
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,455
It's going to be open

1469
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,991
Season on cannibalize

1470
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
You're going to get

1471
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
Points Zoe's

1472
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:22,719
Easy for s******* all over Alex in that realm we already see it now like when he shows up for these interviews on like Rogaine

1473
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,559
Dinner with Patrick bet-david

1474
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Paul

1475
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,887
Like you just get too wasted

1476
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Dumbass

1477
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,007
I'm like eventually that'll wear out if he wasn't like

1478
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,407
I have to show that look super drunk on a YouTube show

1479
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Yeah

1480
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
Fun fun

1481
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,039
So people keep asking Alex like

1482
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
How you doing

1483
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,367
How you doing man not well there's trouble

1484
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,647
Superbad

1485
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,207
How you doing real bad don't worry about me man

1486
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Job

1487
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,679
And I'm like what

1488
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
Forced to wear mask

1489
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,335
Taping them to their heads

1490
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,663
And screaming at them until they're bad because they're white

1491
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:20,063
Won't you think of the white children children

1492
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,695
People ask me how I'm doing with these lawsuits and I say

1493
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:32,095
Don't worry about me worry about the white kids that one that one really is saying the quiet part off of

1494
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
Also don't ask Alex

1495
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,727
How he's doing if you want to know how

1496
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
Alex is doing

1497
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
Ask Alex whether or not the world is going to end well actually that's really interesting because this next

1498
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,991
He's talking about how the good times are over for America

1499
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,551
Know that you're in a good mood are over

1500
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,903
Roaring 20th century women 21st century

1501
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,207
Is abruptly hitting a brick wall

1502
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
What's the surface

1503
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,655
Brace yourselves like when you're in a really bad car wreck

1504
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
Side of a highway in Bangladesh

1505
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,336
What are you doing

1506
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Suburban

1507
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,968
Suburban Inn

1508
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,528
Shut off spun around backwards

1509
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
50 ft magnet

1510
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,600
Plunging into trees

1511
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:30,464
And got away with just concussions were saying brace for impact

1512
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
It's so hard it broke

1513
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
Both our chairs back

1514
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,888
Flying over the main

1515
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Would like 20 years

1516
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,288
It felt like forever

1517
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,360
Bracing for impact

1518
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,664
That's a wild Tornado Story

1519
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,248
I don't think I've ever heard it

1520
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,064
Before and I've listened to a lot of his show

1521
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
The part of me wants

1522
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:04,256
To say that's probably bulshit but it's actually possible that happened there super deadly

1523
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:09,376
Have been documented cases of people being inside cars that are actually picked up by tornadoes and they survive

1524
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,192
I don't think it's a super common thing

1525
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,264
Although there are plenty of tornadoes in Texas

1526
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
Slits

1527
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,312
Conceivable

1528
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
I don't believe it but I'm open to

1529
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,640
To the possibility of it being

1530
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,200
It's it's that that's where I'm at

1531
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,480
It's closer to

1532
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:27,040
Oh I think you probably are happens

1533
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
Come on

1534
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,832
It's been

1535
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,600
How long

1536
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,392
It's been more than five years

1537
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,208
It's been more than five years and I have not heard

1538
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:40,608
This totally awesome story about surviving a f****** tornado before are you shiting me

1539
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,912
Watch a lot of Degrassi

1540
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,216
The Canadian team show I'm aware

1541
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
And one of the things

1542
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,032
Camille never forgive them for Drake

1543
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:53,408
Me and my buddy Nikki gifts one of the things that we were taken aback by is how like

1544
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,248
Yeah a lot of the stuff in these episodes are things that happen

1545
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Into

1546
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,320
Do you know people in school

1547
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,856
Difficulty

1548
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Something growing up course

1549
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
Cast of kids

1550
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,232
Everything

1551
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Happens to them

1552
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:14,400
Not likely it's a bit of a little outside of the norm yeah and I

1553
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,752
These kids are lucky and unlucky it's just nuts

1554
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,312
I feel the same way about Alex like

1555
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:28,480
Possible that you're in a car and you survive the tornado throwing you into a tree Shore

1556
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:34,880
Motherfuking nonsense things in your life

1557
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:41,280
Living in a never-ending the Days of Our Lives episode where everybody has an evil twin and s***

1558
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,584
It's going crazy I know don't know its Passions

1559
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,984
Because

1560
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,848
You notice that we're about to hit a brick wall just after Alex has a really bad piece of personal news

1561
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
It's almost like

1562
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,456
He's about to hit a brick wall in the form of really heavy monetary penalties

1563
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,272
She's projecting that feeling of eminent trouble out of the auto

1564
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,648
He's basically just lashing out at them and trying to make them feel the same bad things he's feeling

1565
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
And it's a childish

1566
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
He talks a bit about the

1567
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
Case like just the same sort of stopped like

1568
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,888
Georgia

1569
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,168
I didn't really lose

1570
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,728
That kind of stuff at the beginning of the episode and I was like

1571
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Ticket to some

1572
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,288
Give me something

1573
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,336
He's got a story here

1574
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
About the new

1575
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,664
The new Pfizer vaccine

1576
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Formula

1577
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:37,088
United Nations in absolutely ruthless

1578
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
Families

1579
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Have even

1580
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,512
Nbcnews and others reporting that old

1581
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,304
Okay it's true

1582
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,912
There is a heart attack drug being added to the children's vaccine

1583
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,216
But it's not for heart problems it says

1584
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Bass

1585
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
To the shot

1586
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:00,640
Are you going to research it has nothing to do with being a base it's not saline water

1587
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,664
Oh my God

1588
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:06,272
Jose just flipped the vaccine

1589
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,136
They just come out and say hello

1590
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
You're right about his had the heart attack drug

1591
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
We just don't put saline in the shots anymore

1592
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,888
Who's a bunch of bulshit question here is tromethamine

1593
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,216
And it's been put into the Pfizer vaccine that's definitely true

1594
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
But it's not related to heart attack

1595
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
And the exploration of replacing it

1596
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
Little more complicated

1597
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,128
Alex's make

1598
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,456
Methenamine

1599
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,992
An ingredient in the moderna vaccine

1600
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
In all along

1601
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,552
And the reason is really straightforward

1602
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,368
Trimethylamine is a very effective preservative

1603
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
If it helps increase

1604
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,416
Drug Shelf

1605
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,792
This is actually a really big deal because one of the arguments advisers made about being unable to

1606
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,096
December vaccine too many parts of the developing world

1607
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,656
Is it has as Reuters but it a quotes

1608
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
Storage requirement at ultra low temperature

1609
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
Which of this will help address

1610
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,848
Tromethamine is used as a stabilizing ingredient many vaccines

1611
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,920
Even a homolog diabetes

1612
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Medication

1613
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,808
Reuters notes that it's also used as a stabilizer in many fragrances and cosmetic products

1614
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:19,232
As for the part about replacing saline it's not that it's replacing that saline solution the way is out to sort of

1615
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
Implying

1616
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:26,144
That feeling is just salt and water and you can help used clean wounds or reduce dehydration

1617
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
The city limits being

1618
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,984
Replaced by the dramatic mean is phosphate buffer

1619
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
Saline which is a very

1620
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,312
Something different

1621
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Perfect from

1622
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
The standard Saline

1623
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
Solutions

1624
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,456
Phosphate buffered saline is disodium hydrogen

1625
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,736
Phosphate added to it

1626
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,016
In this has the effect of helping

1627
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
Stabilized

1628
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,088
The pH level of a of a solution

1629
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
Attitude

1630
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:50,976
However for the needs of this vaccine tromethamine can do what PBS can do and then some

1631
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,256
It makes more sense

1632
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,536
Switch that up

1633
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:57,376
The thing about this being a heart attack. Drug is also kind of

1634
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
Dubious

1635
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,424
The traumatomy itself

1636
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,240
I mean isn't a drug really

1637
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,800
That you give to someone to effectively reduce their risk

1638
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,824
I'm having a heart attack

1639
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:10,944
The primary connection between this drug and cardiac issues is the tromethamine is used to

1640
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,736
Treat metabolic acidosis

1641
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Which is a common side effect of someone

1642
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
May experience

1643
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
If they're having

1644
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,392
Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery

1645
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,464
It's not the tromethamine to dresses be hard

1646
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,304
It's used to deal with a common side effect of the bypass surgery it

1647
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,072
Itself

1648
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,984
In the interest of total fairness it is true that a small amount of heart attacks are thought to possibly be due to metabolic acidosis

1649
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,032
The causal link is a little bit iffy

1650
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
There's an important qualifier

1651
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,152
Doesn't really help with heart attacks per say

1652
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,432
It just helps with metabolic

1653
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
Acidosis which is

1654
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,016
The condition where a person's body is too acidic

1655
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064
Or where the kidneys can't filter the ass

1656
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
Acid in the body quickly enough

1657
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,136
The acid base level in check

1658
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,928
Typically this

1659
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,696
Connection

1660
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,768
Between metabolic acidosis and a person having a heart attack

1661
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,096
Kissimmee elderly who are experiencing difficulty with other

1662
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,120
Games like the kidney

1663
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
And generally this

1664
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,936
The situation is that someone

1665
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Has late-stage

1666
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,984
Chronic kidney disease

1667
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,032
It's not really

1668
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
Relevant

1669
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
2

1670
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,128
Did that story that Alex is trying to tell

1671
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,736
This doesn't even work as a conspiracy theory for Alex

1672
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,832
The point of the globalist plans of the vaccine is supposed to be to kill everyone off

1673
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,600
So what's up

1674
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,648
Does it make for them to create a vaccine that gives

1675
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
People heart attacks and then change

1676
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:27,488
The formula to include something that would stop people from having

1677
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,792
Did they like change their mind

1678
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
What the f*** are we doing

1679
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,120
So

1680
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,424
It's going to kill everybody

1681
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,240
Anywhere from two weeks

1682
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
25-year

1683
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,872
Two weeks to 100

1684
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,528
So now

1685
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,624
The globalist plan after having already succeeded as Alex's said

1686
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
I mean

1687
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,256
Right everybody who's already taken the vaccine is going to die soon

1688
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,304
Leave him then yes

1689
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
They have effect

1690
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:06,144
Actively put heart attack bombs and everybody

1691
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,800
So that you don't need a new formula

1692
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Nope

1693
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:19,968
But it does address some of the issues of stability of the vaccine

1694
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
Itself

1695
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,784
So that is so it's a better murder

1696
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:29,696
I guess I guess that might be the way that

1697
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:34,304
I guess you stumbled onto possibly a way that you could twist this for a kid

1698
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Conspiracy

1699
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:40,960
They're trying to make it more shelf-stable so it can be given to more parts of the world to give heart attacks

1700
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Two more people

1701
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:45,568
But Alex's house

1702
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,128
We've stumbled once again upon a better

1703
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Conspiracy theory

1704
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:49,664
The well

1705
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,432
Dammit

1706
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
So Alex is mad about

1707
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:59,392
NBC or MSNBC anchor named Stephanie ruhle

1708
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,696
Song about how Americans

1709
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
Can pay for

1710
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,024
Inflation affected Prada

1711
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,816
There's a little bit tone-deaf

1712
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,840
But Alex

1713
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Is

1714
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
Is a little bit off base here to

1715
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,960
NBC anchor

1716
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:13,984
Stephanie

1717
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Rule

1718
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
What's a salary

1719
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,736
Tiffany ruh

1720
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Ellie

1721
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,064
I was asking that your answer on that

1722
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,184
What's her salary at NBC News cuz she's

1723
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
Sitting there

1724
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,216
Telling you that you're getting $40,000 a year as a single mother

1725
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,544
You just need to learn that you had it too well

1726
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,848
So Stephanie ruhle absolutely does

1727
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,432
Like millions of dollars a year at MBC although I'm sure she does

1728
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,504
If I was wants to talk about how she's really rich

1729
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
You should

1730
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,808
Salary

1731
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,832
MBC

1732
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,136
HP a conversation of her activity you in

1733
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,416
The world of hedge funds

1734
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:08,000
Which I'm pretty sure brought in way more money than anything

1735
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,280
ABC

1736
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,840
So she works

1737
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,864
Hedge funds

1738
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
So much fun

1739
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:17,728
And now she's on TV

1740
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,544
Yeah she's on MSNBC isn't Tom steyer

1741
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
She told everybody just paper

1742
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,504
Yes she did say that the average Americans can afford to handle inflation and well she's probably right about most of the people in her

1743
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,272
Circle

1744
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,576
That came off as a painfully unaware state

1745
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,648
She's gotten a lot of backlash and rightfully so

1746
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,952
I'm not sure that her make

1747
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:42,816
Dumb comments on NBC's really the hard-hitting news that Alex likes to imagine he covers but

1748
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:46,144
I don't know I probably just leave this alone with him and deal with him or press

1749
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,192
Issue like everyone's dying

1750
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,752
Yeah I mean you know in my book

1751
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
F*** her

1752
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,080
Of course but also like

1753
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
On our list of s***

1754
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:59,712
To deal with she's way low down there really rank

1755
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Unless you're just drying

1756
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:07,648
To engage with the attention economy engage and get some points off of that

1757
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:10,208
And then it's all forgotten the next day so who fuc

1758
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
Yeah

1759
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,768
I think I think that there is

1760
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,560
The conversation to be had about like

1761
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
People in the

1762
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:20,960
24-hour news networks people say stupid s*** on there all the time

1763
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,008
And maybe maybe doing a better job

1764
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,312
And in terms of some of that

1765
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Get any

1766
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
Closer to achieving that

1767
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,712
By talking about the individual in

1768
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
Instances

1769
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:35,296
And making a big deal out of the individual times

1770
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
People say stupid s***

1771
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,600
I don't know

1772
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,904
Tybee I might be wrong in that but

1773
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,976
It seems Mighty trivial for something that I like

1774
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
Thank you.

1775
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,584
I mean the D idea of

1776
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,864
You know like

1777
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,680
TV news requires a

1778
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,960
Top-down rewrite

1779
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
All all

1780
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,848
Page one get f****** rid of it and then start over

1781
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,664
So what one of them does I really don't care

1782
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,736
I hate I hate to

1783
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:10,880
We can never really go back I don't think but I don't think the 24-hour news channels are really approach

1784
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,160
They're bad

1785
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,208
But I don't know what to do

1786
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,792
Anyway Alex is convinced that this Stephanie ruhle makes millions

1787
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
5 million

1788
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,080
Salary at MSNBC is 150,000 a year

1789
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,360
But she

1790
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Decimated

1791
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,016
So I guess the correct

1792
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
So

1793
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,112
There you go

1794
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,976
According to pay scale the average salary for news anchors at

1795
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
NBC is

1796
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
60 9370

1797
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,560
$18

1798
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,608
With a high range being 100

1799
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Ben Ten Thousand

1800
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:59,264
No one is presented a shred of evidence to prove that she makes 18 times the high end of the salary range

1801
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,640
But that's the salary that's listed for her on one of the very sketchy celebrity net worth type sites

1802
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:08,480
Sure the two million is the figure he'll get from legit

1803
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,784
Is the name of the website it's run out of Nigeria

1804
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:17,440
Most likely Alex chose this one because all the other sites that you can find the site

1805
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:21,280
Significantly lower salaries for her it doesn't work for the point

1806
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
He's trying to make

1807
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
A lot of them

1808
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,120
I have figures like 200,000

1809
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
I was just talking s*** about the

1810
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,704
Does two million a year.

1811
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,544
I think part of the reason that he thinks of his even within the realm of possibility

1812
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,944
Might be that he makes millions a Year everyone else does too

1813
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,504
Media and I make millions of dollars a year

1814
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,624
So assumably that's just a guess on my part

1815
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,952
The story about how out-of-touch Stephanie ruhle is I need might be just

1816
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,976
Exposing Howard touch

1817
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,768
It's a

1818
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,816
As per usual

1819
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Wapo

1820
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,632
The Washington Post

1821
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,288
Here's another one Washington Post

1822
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,360
MSNBC both

1823
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
Call

1824
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,176
Republican

1825
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,480
You're not allowed to be a Republican

1826
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,576
Rules prohibit media Outlets

1827
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,648
Referring anyone who's the Republican as normal

1828
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,000
Politically correct

1829
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,096
Krampus

1830
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:31,168
If I'm not mistaken and I'm not we're just

1831
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,960
Months removed from Alex going on and

1832
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
Extended campaign pushing for the outlawing of the Democratic Party

1833
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,152
Even if the Washington Post said the things he's saying it's kind of childish for him to have this response

1834
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,688
Let's do it he's just like

1835
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
Doing what I do

1836
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,760
Do that

1837
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:51,904
You just mad about Jennifer Rubin going on in MSNBC show and saying there should be rules

1838
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
Go to call Republicans normal anymore

1839
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
It's not normal pilot

1840
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,000
For whatever

1841
01:34:56,512 --> 01:35:02,656
This is a far cry from Alex literally advocating for the outlawing of the democratic party on multiple occasions and again

1842
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,704
Such a trivial story to be spending

1843
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Time on

1844
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,824
At times it feels like it shows just a grouchy old man gets mad at cable news

1845
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,848
Disney wants to yell about

1846
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:17,248
Yeah that sounds about right to him now he's just sitting on his reclining chair with

1847
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
Glass of scotch

1848
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,600
Set matters like I'm mad at the ladies

1849
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,744
Jennifer Rubin said something I don't like

1850
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,280
I I mean but if

1851
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
If one day we just woke up

1852
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,632
And you were about to listen to the show

1853
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
And all the sudden you

1854
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Just tired

1855
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Lineup

1856
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:39,776
Lionel Lionel Lionel and Alex came out was like

1857
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,080
I hate bookbags on the train

1858
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,616
It'd be the best day of my life

1859
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,688
I don't know if I would enjoy that I think I would lose interest in you

1860
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,968
Pretty quick

1861
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
So Alex

1862
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,784
Has buddies in the real me

1863
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,064
Josie

1864
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
They've been getting in contact with

1865
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,696
You don't have a lot of people I know a lot of great people

1866
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Texting me

1867
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
Apache hey

1868
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,192
You know the inside baseball on this you should respond

1869
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
But they're pumping out

1870
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,288
Every newspaper

1871
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,360
Japan to Germany to the United States did you know

1872
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
Tens of thousands

1873
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Posted

1874
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
Stones found guilty

1875
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
That's a judge

1876
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,880
Totally abusing their discretion

1877
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,952
Absolutely. Invasion

1878
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:34,304
So yeah Rogan wants a statement

1879
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
Maybe Tim pool cuz

1880
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Spell except

1881
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,960
Contempo pool is in town we know that

1882
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:45,568
Truth imagine imagine how sad would that be

1883
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
Quite

1884
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,920
So yeah Alex's getting jammed up

1885
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,200
Judgment fraud

1886
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,760
When we talked to Mark

1887
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,112
One of the things that we discussed was the bank record

1888
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
Scan the way Alex

1889
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,208
Who has an accountant

1890
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:06,048
Clean them up a little bit to be a little

1891
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:10,144
One Step a little bit in the right areas you know Alex talking about that

1892
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,472
Default

1893
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,288
Respect

1894
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,592
Gave them

1895
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,528
What I said or did

1896
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:33,952
Just give it to another planet the default this and I want to make him do it all the way and then they just said this isn't your real thing

1897
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
You can't prove a negative

1898
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
They said well

1899
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,656
Not

1900
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,472
QuickBooks file it's insane

1901
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,496
It's a spreadsheet

1902
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,832
Database

1903
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,880
It goes back to the beginning

1904
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
QuickBooks

1905
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,744
From this date to that

1906
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
Spreadsheet

1907
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,608
That's what I'm defaulting for

1908
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,424
Spreadsheets can

1909
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,752
Every transaction at this coupling

1910
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
That's outrageous

1911
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
They were always going to be salted

1912
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,712
And they're always going to do it at the

1913
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,992
Appeals court level 2

1914
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
Illustrate the whole thing

1915
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
That gives us the time

1916
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
Forward

1917
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,256
This is not my battle

1918
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,280
This is not my War

1919
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
This is kind of like

1920
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,888
Chihuahuas that has

1921
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,472
Rabies is biting me in the leg

1922
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
I got

1923
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,152
Allegory

1924
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,760
Chihuahua chewing on my leg

1925
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,296
Rabie shots later

1926
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,856
Triage things like

1927
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
Cash

1928
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
That's a little bit of

1929
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,744
Confusing I guess I understand the point of his metaphor

1930
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Somebody needs

1931
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,280
Call QuickBooks

1932
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Because I mean

1933
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,936
Obviously they had this massive oversight where you can't like choose what dates you want to print out the files

1934
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:24,032
Like there's no way you can own when you go into the QuickBooks

1935
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:30,432
Software you can only download all of your finances or none

1936
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:34,272
Is really specific about that

1937
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:39,136
I don't like Half Steppin

1938
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:42,208
File from date today haha I'm QuickBooks

1939
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,840
I insist that I my software is only used

1940
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:51,168
For the entire history of a company

1941
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
Another

1942
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,728
Work QuickBooks

1943
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:58,336
It's going to take awhile to download your files there's a part of me that legitimately

1944
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,872
Thanks like maybe Alex

1945
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,688
Doesn't use QuickBooks

1946
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,784
Like maybe the issue is that like his finances are on like

1947
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,064
Sheets of paper

1948
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,672
Something maybe that's why

1949
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:17,536
If you walked into his office and there was just a big like

1950
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,632
Gallon drum of receipts you be like

1951
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,472
The HR representative

1952
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,312
Torino's like maybe his nephew is

1953
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
Everyone get paid

1954
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:33,152
Bullion

1955
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,224
It's strange also did the

1956
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
The attempt

1957
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,064
To be like I'm not even mad about

1958
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,440
It's so great

1959
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:49,024
We've hit a massive roadblock and everybody's going to die

1960
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,792
I'm not a

1961
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:56,448
I never actually even really cared about these laws

1962
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:02,848
This is essentially the same thing that happened with the Chobani lawsuit

1963
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,640
Defender

1964
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:07,456
I will die or be proven right

1965
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Apology

1966
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
It's

1967
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:13,344
Blustery nonsense until there's a decision

1968
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,904
Loses or is going to lose

1969
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:21,280
It's a turning tail and be like I didn't really care about that at all

1970
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,096
But also the country is gone

1971
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,400
Bonded us

1972
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,032
Incredible news

1973
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,640
Think that what's happening to me

1974
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Infowars

1975
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
I know it's a symptom of the disease

1976
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Disease of corruption and

1977
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
The end of the country as we know it

1978
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,168
This is Modern Warfare run

1979
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,616
I spend my time

1980
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,992
Talkin HBO or talking to

1981
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,784
The Wall Street Journal or

1982
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,344
Running around trying to defend myself

1983
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,648
Fake fangs

1984
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:26,560
The implication of what Alex is saying is that if he does

1985
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,328
Doesn't stay focus

1986
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,096
Start the work

1987
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,888
That he is doing the Pacific

1988
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,448
He's doing correct all hope for the planet is lost

1989
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,544
Narcissistic garbage no no

1990
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,312
10

1991
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,360
This is a rational

1992
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,920
Clear-eyed understanding of the

1993
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,224
Current circumstances

1994
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
You put all of the math

1995
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
Together

1996
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
Get the order of operation

1997
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,112
Worked out right at all

1998
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,160
Cancels out until you get one mad

1999
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:58,560
Look I mean the world will disappear and everything will fall apart if Alex doesn't interview with v

2000
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:06,240
Meanwhile he'll go get drunk broken podcast the place where if he closes his eyes I imagine

2001
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,264
He thinks everyone's

2002
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:13,920
Like every time you might not understand object permanence

2003
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:16,736
Everything is predator predicated upon whether or not ice

2004
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
BND

2005
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,856
I like that

2006
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
In terms of

2007
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,000
Such an illustration of narcissism

2008
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,560
If I stop for a second

2009
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Do address

2010
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,144
The fact that I just lost these cases

2011
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,912
If I give it

2012
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,680
Comment

2013
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,472
Do a media Outlet about this

2014
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,264
Do we we will

2015
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,800
Lose the world

2016
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:44,640
Hey bro I mean it's it's

2017
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,664
Fun

2018
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
Like

2019
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,224
Default judgments

2020
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,296
You know as we talked about with Mark the first time

2021
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,064
You know they were like

2022
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,648
This is exceedingly rare and they only use that they only really

2023
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:00,768
Teach these in school you do now we've got Alex is an example of a teaching Law School

2024
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,048
Why not

2025
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,584
Remember

2026
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,888
That in Psychiatry School

2027
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:12,032
They're going to use Alex's of narcissism example as well he's going to be taught in a lot of different schools

2028
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
Sure

2029
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:18,432
Play exciting you might be taught in a rambling school to if there ever is such a thing

2030
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,992
Cuz he starts talking but

2031
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,160
Does Harry does a professional ramble about how he gets to stay in

2032
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:28,928
A quiet place

2033
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
The most

2034
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,512
Opposition

2035
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,048
Coupon

2036
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,824
How you can fight back against those cuz we're very close to winning

2037
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,384
Infowars

2038
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:54,784
In this position

2039
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,600
Champion for Liberty

2040
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Whiteboard app

2041
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:10,656
But I also want to get knowing the end these evildoers will be punished will be.

2042
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,496
False Flags

2043
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,336
Blame me for them and others they already have

2044
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,872
January 6th

2045
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,712
Somebody's gotta.

2046
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,736
The coward stand-ups

2047
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,064
All I ask you if she's that you pray

2048
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
Rainforest

2049
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,904
You spread the word about the broadcasting

2050
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,696
So we can go into this fight

2051
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,720
B strong

2052
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,768
And give it a hundred and 10%

2053
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,816
Please pray for Infowars please pray for

2054
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,608
Please pray for my family

2055
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Pray that

2056
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,192
Focus and Clarity and

2057
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:44,960
Calm

2058
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,240
Steady heart

2059
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
Mind and

2060
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
In the high place

2061
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,920
What quiet place

2062
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
King David talked about

2063
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,736
The most high

2064
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,112
Quiet still place

2065
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
Of the most high

2066
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
You're doing great

2067
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,976
The place

2068
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Home

2069
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280
Focused understanding

2070
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,072
I am just

2071
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,864
Moving forward and Cecile

2072
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:27,456
Completely separate unrelated entirely amazing that shift is just

2073
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,480
Professional

2074
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Wow

2075
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,624
I would ask that you pray that God keep me in the place of the most high also free shipping

2076
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,160
I mean

2077
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:43,328
Just that you know how much I hate Commerce in religion pushed

2078
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,608
Together in the way that he

2079
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
He combines

2080
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
The two of them

2081
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,192
So good

2082
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,216
Like a Prayer

2083
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
Prosperity Gospel.

2084
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:54,336
Teacher-parent to like you you and I and many other

2085
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,152
People that the strategy

2086
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
But at the same time like

2087
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,736
He's consistently done it

2088
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
4 years

2089
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,808
Must be effective

2090
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,880
Success

2091
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:12,768
How many different Prosperity Gospel Zone more than one jet. Very successful way to do thing

2092
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,352
Yeah I guess so people like to hear lies especially of God

2093
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,120
What is telling them

2094
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Yeah

2095
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,656
Not boy

2096
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,472
So Alex went to San Antonio

2097
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,008
Recently

2098
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,544
And he got himself a

2099
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,080
An interview with Mike Flynn

2100
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,360
General Mike Flynn

2101
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,408
Wow

2102
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,456
Oh yeah real hard

2103
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:38,368
Yeah I'm busy all the time so at this point

2104
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,904
We hasn't aired that interview

2105
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,232
And even like talking right now I don't believe you

2106
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,256
Please put out any of it

2107
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,304
Some thoughts about the

2108
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,840
General Flynn

2109
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:51,424
Let me just say this right now

2110
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,984
Got an interview with a general Flynn

2111
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,056
Saturday

2112
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,336
Crowd of 5,000 people

2113
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,176
Cornerstone Church

2114
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,456
T-shirts

2115
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,208
See him

2116
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Basically

2117
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Accustomed

2118
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,584
To being a civilian leader

2119
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,144
Gebrakan

2120
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,448
A person that can be George Washington 2.0

2121
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
Better suited than somebody

2122
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,592
Like Trump

2123
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:34,176
Understands that the

2124
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
Yeah

2125
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,248
Just

2126
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,016
Wit

2127
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,832
You want to do this again

2128
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,904
You also didn't we hate fun for awhile

2129
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,720
No I don't think so

2130
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,632
That's fair that is fair

2131
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,680
Mike Flynn

2132
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,728
Alex has been

2133
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,008
Rudy on board with

2134
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,288
For the most

2135
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,336
Possibly when there was a

2136
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,896
The chance that it look like he was flipping on Trump

2137
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:10,016
Remember a little stretch where Alex was

2138
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,808
At least not into it but

2139
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:12,832
He likes

2140
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,904
I think I actually agree

2141
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,744
Could be another George Washington my perspective

2142
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
It's the dark version

2143
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,304
End of our first president

2144
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:28,960
We made some comments that we're going to get into it later when he was speaking at the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio over just

2145
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
Before this

2146
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,544
But it's also important to note that this was part of it wasn't

2147
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,568
Just like a speech at a

2148
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:38,176
The church that was part of the Fairly qanon leading reawaken America Tour

2149
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,760
Other speakers included Mike Lindell Rodger Stone.

2150
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,552
Q. Street Fighter

2151
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:47,136
Former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne and of course

2152
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:51,488
Stella Immanuel the Ivermectin Doctor Who believes that we're living in Revelation

2153
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:56,096
Lumos wizard promo code on her website to Alex's listeners can get 5% off their drug purchase

2154
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,376
Very nice of her to do

2155
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:00,448
Creeps and Weirdos were advertised speakers

2156
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,520
Strangely missing from that advertisement was Alex

2157
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,544
Zohid

2158
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,104
Get a speaking slot at the event

2159
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,992
No s*** god dammit either he was a surprise guest or they

2160
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,296
Thought like we can't put them on the poster

2161
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,576
It's too too much

2162
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
See

2163
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,368
That's

2164
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,928
I think that's unjust

2165
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,208
I do

2166
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:27,584
I genuinely am mad about that they are ostracizing Alex

2167
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
Compared to those murderers of idiots

2168
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:36,800
Like what are we talkin about based on the assumption that Alec didn't just show up and

2169
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,080
Mother like I will give you

2170
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:44,736
Street Fighter talk I'm sure he could have five if he wants

2171
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,808
Doesn't animation from the poster based on like we do honestly he's here

2172
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
It might just be that he

2173
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,624
Was unplanned

2174
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:55,488
But yeah the clip I saw of his speech was mostly what you'd expect

2175
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:59,328
It's just meaningless platitudes about how his enemies work for the literal devil are

2176
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,400
How this is the most important time in human history

2177
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,216
Mountains for General Flynn his speech was a little more into

2178
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:11,360
There were news stories covering how he said quote if we're going to have one nation under God which we

2179
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:16,736
We must we have to have one religion nation under God and one religion under God

2180
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:23,648
As the founders wrote in the Constitution Dan it's so f***** up I don't really even know how to engage

2181
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,672
Beige with it like

2182
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,536
Today these are the people Gathering who yell about the Constitution all the time and there

2183
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,864
Hero worshipping a lunatic ex-general is advocating something

2184
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,960
In direct opposition to the First Amendment but I think we should do

2185
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
Arkansas

2186
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,520
Situational Duty

2187
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:43,872
Which of course is to overthrow the United States government and turn this into the Opera

2188
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:48,736
Chrissy just like the founders intended when they wrote that Constitution that specifically outlawed

2189
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:53,088
Little bit f***** up or at least like

2190
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,112
You talkin about

2191
01:51:54,368 --> 01:52:00,512
Eclipse

2192
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,048
What was the last hope for the world

2193
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:08,704
There's a time and you have to believe this almighty God is like involved in this country because this is it

2194
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,728
This is it

2195
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,776
This is the last place on Earth

2196
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,848
This is this is The Shining City on the hill

2197
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:17,408
This is the city on the hill the city on the hill

2198
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,968
The city on the hill was mentioned in Matthew okay

2199
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,784
It was mentioned in Matthew but then this guy by the name of wind

2200
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
Mentioned it again

2201
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088
16:30

2202
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,904
6030 okay before the country was formed

2203
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,464
Just cuz

2204
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:35,328
Several hundred years after Winthrop said that Reagan said it

2205
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,352
So now

2206
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:40,960
Flynn is assuming that was actually goes on to mention that Reagan said in the sort of part of the

2207
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:43,520
The connection right but Reagan was just

2208
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:51,456
Based on his stated beliefs on the way the cunanan the other right-wing communities respond to him

2209
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:54,016
Splinters of the potential to be there George Washing

2210
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,832
The first president of the Fundamentalist

2211
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,600
International

2212
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,904
Dictatorship they so desperately want to be

2213
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,184
Yeah that's wild

2214
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,488
I remember that

2215
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,560
I really am blown away that these people with

2216
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,608
The constitution in their f****** pocket

2217
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,400
It's looking up

2218
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,936
General Flynn

2219
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:12,704
Obvious

2220
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,240
Bulshit about nothing

2221
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,776
I'm thinking

2222
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,336
I want to overthrow democracy for that

2223
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
That's what I want them

2224
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,664
Wow so the global

2225
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,944
Control pretty much every

2226
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,016
Base because if you just Define

2227
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:28,064
The globalist has anybody you don't like

2228
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
Yeah you can say they have both

2229
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,416
The houses of Congress

2230
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,720
But you know they don't have they don't have the minds of

2231
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,400
Most the city

2232
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,056
Controls for election fraud

2233
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:53,152
Portage School District

2234
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,200
Enmeshment

2235
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
After 8 year old girl

2236
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,504
Hold them

2237
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:05,440
They should be in prison Palm Beach County School District has ended a mask mandate just days after a second

2238
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,464
School Board officials

2239
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:09,024
They should all rot in jail

2240
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,608
Face coverings

2241
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,448
There's a fun story and I can see how Alex would want to present the idea that this

2242
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,240
Greater shame to school board

2243
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:21,056
The impetus to stop a mess mandating is Bob County

2244
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:22,848
Palm Beach County Schools but that's for

2245
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,384
And the children will lead

2246
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:31,552
Florida's Department of Health had released an order that prohibited schools from having

2247
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,320
Could opt out of

2248
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:35,136
This school district however decided to go again

2249
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:35,904
And that order

2250
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,952
The second grader Alex is talking about it

2251
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:41,536
The daughter of a woman named Bailey lashelle's and for about 2 months cheap

2252
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,816
Suspended for refusing

2253
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,840
Wear mask at school

2254
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:49,984
Ultimately it wasn't her activism or the mom having her eight-year-old daughter go on Fox news shows

2255
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,520
That ended the school district map

2256
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Text message Mandy

2257
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:57,152
The decision was based on a Court ruling that

2258
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,968
School District was in violation of the Department of Health order

2259
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,784
And the fact that children could not be vaccinated

2260
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,344
I am at local covid rates at Fallen traumatic

2261
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
Decision

2262
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,648
I was made to not lie

2263
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,208
My parents opted out of children wearing

2264
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:16,096
It's fun to imagine that a second grader yelled at school board and they were so taken aback by the truth

2265
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,632
She was spitting at them that they

2266
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,680
Howard and stop requiring masks but that's

2267
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,728
Not true I throw this out here

2268
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,032
And this might sound crazy

2269
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,848
So if a noose

2270
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
Food Network

2271
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,896
Is

2272
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
Rabbit

2273
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,760
For any content that reinforce

2274
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Is there bull

2275
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,576
They will grab up

2276
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,600
Anyone

2277
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,880
Anywhere

2278
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:41,440
Who is fulfilled any part of their narrative

2279
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,976
I put them on TV

2280
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,768
Is it possible Dan

2281
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,816
That might be an incentive

2282
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:48,864
For people who want to get on TV

2283
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
It might be

2284
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:55,008
Or run for Congress has it seems like if you just

2285
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:58,592
Sly about b******* and they your there's a TV network

2286
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,872
Yeah

2287
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,432
Alex does end up playing her speech

2288
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,200
This

2289
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,224
8 year old

2290
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,248
And I don't

2291
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,552
Really believe she wrote it herself

2292
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,600
She might have I don't know but it

2293
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:11,136
It's it doesn't strike me as

2294
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:17,280
These last days I feel the Sword of Damocles hangs over all

2295
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,304
Right

2296
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,120
Stuff that I'm not sure eight-year-olds

2297
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:24,704
Fully would be able to process but maybe you can I don't know

2298
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,984
I don't know this kid

2299
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,264
But it's

2300
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,544
It's a little bit dicey

2301
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,080
And it me saying that

2302
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:34,688
I know that Alex would come back with something like what about Greta thunberg

2303
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:40,064
Sure and I would say that there's a big difference between a teenager and an eight-year-old huge

2304
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,856
I don't know if

2305
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,648
An eight-year-old really

2306
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:47,744
Necessarily be on Fox News

2307
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,536
Giving anti-vax

2308
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,120
I would even say that an eight-year-old

2309
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:56,192
Being there giving a message of like climate

2310
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,728
Control climate change

2311
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,496
Awareness

2312
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,288
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that

2313
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,056
Even

2314
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
The kid

2315
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,616
It's their parents making

2316
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Decision

2317
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,224
I would say an eight-year-old saying something like

2318
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,808
The world is better

2319
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
That's totally great but that's

2320
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:16,160
Vague very vague

2321
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,208
Cousin eight-year-olds would want to keep it Bae

2322
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:24,608
An eight-year-old saying I hope the world is better is a very inspiring message

2323
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:26,400
Talking about carbon emissions

2324
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:31,520
I don't I don't know what it would it brings to the table

2325
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,824
Yeah

2326
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,408
I'm comfortable with it in the same way that I was uncomfortable like

2327
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,432
I don't know

2328
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:41,504
10 year old who is racist

2329
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,808
Exploiting children Dan and I don't get that

2330
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,344
I just now

2331
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
I only

2332
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,928
You really decided to talk about this at all

2333
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,208
Because what Alex says

2334
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:56,864
Okay and my town for this because I think Alex is going on a protracted little bit of a ramble about

2335
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,400
But how he's disappointed that his daughter

2336
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,448
Just be honest with you

2337
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,288
My oldest daughter is a wonderful day

2338
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,176
And she want to go to public school.

2339
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:12,992
High School

2340
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,064
You just recently figured it out

2341
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,856
Call Steve

2342
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:18,880
Because the mask

2343
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,416
She just wants to

2344
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,440
Go back to Bravo

2345
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,304
The way she wanted it

2346
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,888
She said I don't want to be

2347
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,424
Like you I love you I was

2348
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,704
Thank you but I don't want to

2349
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,824
I'm glad you're doing it for us

2350
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
What she said

2351
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,456
I want to go to school anymore since they want to let me wear the mask

2352
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
Private School summer

2353
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,064
What's happening

2354
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,088
We got robbed

2355
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:49,856
If you wish to go

2356
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,392
The Graduate

2357
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:56,768
I understand that

2358
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:04,192
Sometimes your children don't do the things you'd want to do sometimes

2359
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
Following your footsteps

2360
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,312
This young lady

2361
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,872
He's doing exactly what I asked my daughter to do

2362
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
Go in there you need to get it fixed

2363
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:24,160
Let them push everybody around that's

2364
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,720
Our family does is we bleed

2365
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,840
My daughter down

2366
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,424
Oh God this is

2367
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,752
Oh God

2368
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,544
You know I would like

2369
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,592
I would really I think

2370
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,640
The problem with me not having kids

2371
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
Get the thank you from

2372
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,480
The kids that I don't have

2373
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,528
That I didn't later on goat

2374
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:52,320
Tell jokes about that more

2375
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:55,904
Talk about them on this podcast or something along those lines

2376
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:00,000
You're welcome unborn children

2377
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,536
Get a sense

2378
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,096
That there's a little bit of disappointment on Alex

2379
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:06,912
That his daughter would not be his proxy

2380
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,984
I'm in this fight that he wants to have

2381
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:12,544
So he could get a lot of attention

2382
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,616
That you don't want to go to school

2383
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,408
Stand up in front of

2384
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,432
All of your friend

2385
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,736
And tell them that your dad Alex

2386
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,504
Jones

2387
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,272
Says

2388
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,296
He thinks

2389
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,576
Is all bulshit

2390
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,112
You don't want to say that why

2391
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,416
Give me any reason

2392
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,488
You're telling me that it is very

2393
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,144
Delicate moment in the duration process

2394
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,728
Want to alienate yourself from literally everybody around you because

2395
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,520
You're taking a stand

2396
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:47,360
Publicly for my b******* I can't sing I can't think of any reason why

2397
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,664
I just

2398
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,456
I feel

2399
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,224
Like

2400
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:56,576
This is unhealthy and Alex should

2401
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,184
Be

2402
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,976
Expressing things that are

2403
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,768
If I was his daughter I'd be hurt by

2404
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,560
I will be furious

2405
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:12,448
Time processing hours

2406
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:15,264
Text talking about this eight-year-old that he admires

2407
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,824
And being likewise what I wanted my daughter to do

2408
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,104
I mean

2409
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,408
That would be tough so f******

2410
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,944
Shuffle

2411
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,736
That's awful the new to somebody

2412
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,784
To it because then there's the

2413
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,832
I mean Ender was always

2414
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
It's your Alec

2415
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,368
Texas kid

2416
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Obviously

2417
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,952
What's a f****** blackmail threat

2418
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,256
If you don't do this the next time

2419
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,048
I'm going to go on my show

2420
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,584
And keep f****** talking about

2421
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,984
It makes it clear that if you don't do the things that I want you to do

2422
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,264
They'll be disappointed

2423
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,544
And it's kind of

2424
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,104
Likes is there's a similarity in here my love is

2425
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:56,736
There's a similarity in it like if you're a high school basketball player in your not very good and like

2426
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,528
Your do do you go to a game

2427
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,112
And the opposing team is I have a really good player on it anytime it's like

2428
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:08,512
I wish I was

2429
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,632
F***.

2430
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:19,008
I'm taking that kid out for pizza later none for you shitbag a slice of

2431
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,800
Pizza Big 12

2432

I get this eight-year-old on my show. My daughter

2433
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,688
Anyway Alex Goes to calls

2434
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:29,248
And he takes a call from a guy that has a dangerous

2435
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:31,808
Let's go

2436
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:34,112
Mike in England thank you for calling

2437
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,392
Welcome to your life

2438
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,464
Take my call in

2439
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,232
Praise God

2440
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:41,280
One thing

2441
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,608
Text to but you haven't really told

2442
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,632
Truth about it

2443
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,192
Do you know a guy named David

2444
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,728
Bronstein dr. David Braun

2445
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,544
Yeah he he

2446
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,080
Clinic on using

2447
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,616
Iodine and

2448
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,920
And when you do

2449
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,968
Talk about using nebulizer

2450
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:00,736
Nebulizer

2451
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Didn't really get it

2452
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
How sexy

2453
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,856
My wife and I were

2454
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,928
We use X2

2455
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:10,208
Do two drops of X2

2456
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,256
And you have to really cut

2457
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,024
Down on the

2458
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
Recommend

2459
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:16,864
The food safe

2460
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,472
Cut it down like

2461
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:22,752
Dixieland

2462
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
Light

2463
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,824
And every time we use it

2464
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:26,848
It is

2465
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,128
Just cleans the lungs

2466
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:28,896
Cleans the song

2467
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,688
Because that's where the

2468
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,968
The majority of the ins

2469
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,248
She's going to transfer into

2470
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,552
Listening

2471
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,576
And then it along

2472
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,600
And it did

2473
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:41,696
People just need to know I think if you interviewed

2474
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:42,464
Dr. David

2475
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,024
Maybe.

2476
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
Because he is

2477
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,352
Basically built on that

2478
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:53,216
Fully aware that most people are deficient in iodine

2479
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:54,752
Edina

2480
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,800
Another substance was not

2481
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:06,784
Atomic iodine good save good save just talk about the iodine don't talk about other guys basically telling you to inhale bleach

2482
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,064
Listen listen

2483
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:13,184
You do what you want to drink a little bit of a sad you don't want to drink a lot

2484
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,024
So one thing it's super important to point out about what this color is dark

2485
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
About is that

2486
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
Food grade

2487
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,608
Hydrogen peroxide is not food

2488
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,704
That is a misnomer and it's just called because it meets the standards

2489
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,472
Clean things

2490
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,752
Places where food is packed

2491
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,520
Kitchen handle

2492
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:30,080
They can also be used in things like bleach

2493
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
Pink flower

2494
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,128
Please that is also

2495
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,408
I guess it's close as we get to

2496
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
Right

2497
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
Cleaning out the

2498
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,480
Score some

2499
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:40,320
Context the type of hydrogen peroxide most people beginning from the store is

2500
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,344
3% hydrogen

2501
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
Peroxide

2502
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:44,416
Food grade is 35%

2503
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:49,792
There are some medicinal uses that makes some sense but it's a pretty much all of them are

2504
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:50,816
Topical app

2505
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
Applications

2506
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,632
Like Stockton and corns or disinfectant

2507
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,400
Small cuts

2508
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:56,192
But even in these cases if

2509
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,472
Got to be super diluted

2510
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,752
Which is why the stuff you buy it

2511
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,288
The store is 3%

2512
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,592
I hate to say this but

2513
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,152
Just because this guy is saying you should nebulize and inhaled

2514
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,944
This bleach cocktail instead of drink it

2515
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,736
That doesn't make it any more safe

2516
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,784
This definitely can still be toxic

2517
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,576
Particularly if you mess up your

2518
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:13,600
When you're deluding

2519
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:20,512
I would say that Alex has no idea who David bronstein is he was bluffing where the caller asked but this case he might

2520
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,792
Exactly know who that dude is

2521
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,072
Since I want to valak

2522
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:23,840
Is anti-vax

2523
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,864
Patriots doctor

2524
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,912
Nicola has promoted him at the

2525
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,216
Snow

2526
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,776
But man f***** up f***** up call

2527
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,312
Imo

2528
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,848
What did you inhale

2529
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:39,712
Hydrogen peroxide time consistently Blown Away

2530
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:40,480
Because

2531
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:43,040
The one truth about Humanity that

2532
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,064
Stayed consistent

2533
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,600
Through arant

2534
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,624
Tire history

2535
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,416
Is when people feel bad

2536
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,976
A lot of them are going to try and solve it

2537
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:51,744
With poison

2538
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,048
That's a very weird thing that is

2539
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:54,816
Stayed with us

2540
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,608
Bumbleberry f****** beginning

2541
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,632
Yeah

2542
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,400
The Abbot

2543
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,680
But it's kind of like

2544
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:03,776
This eating poison ivy

2545
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,360
Pissed off

2546
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,640
Toxic

2547
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:10,432
On some level maybe it'll kill the bad stuff

2548
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,784
Right now I get that beat the idea of

2549
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,552
2 -

2550
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:22,464
I was worried about this color but I was even more worried that Alex is kind of Intuit

2551
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:27,072
Medical doctors on Atlanta folks talking about what they would do

2552
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,144
Help themselves or studies out there showing like you said

2553
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,424
Highly diluted

2554
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:32,704
Hydrogen peroxide

2555
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,032
That alone

2556
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Cleans out

2557
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,128
A few days while

2558
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,920
Colonizing

2559
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,040
According to research

2560
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:50,624
We just talked about all this stuff here on air

2561
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:53,184
And we probably should make a bigger deal.

2562
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:55,232
Please.

2563
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:59,840
But I have to say this but there are not studies that show that inhaling hydrogen peroxide through your nose

2564
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,864
Clears out covid

2565
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,144
Before it has a chance to hurt you

2566
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:08,544
Why would anyone do that study that's just really dumb advice

2567
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:14,944
There are some ideas for nasal irrigation

2568
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:15,712
Or mouthwash

2569
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,784
I like that type of thing

2570
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,552
But it's not

2571
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:20,320
Ingested

2572
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:26,464
There's no compelling evidence or actual studies that show this conclusion but there's some ideas that if possible

2573
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,024
Even then doing a nasal rinse

2574
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,328
It's with a diluted solution is a bit

2575
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:33,376
Inhaling hydrogen peroxide

2576
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,144
Which there is

2577
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,680
No evidence is effective

2578
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,216
And in September actually

2579
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:43,616
The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America released a statement people that regardless

2580
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:46,432
Do not put hydrogen peroxide in your inhalers

2581
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:51,040
Dangerous to this and no good evidence showing it helps at all so

2582
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,576
This is definitely something Alex

2583
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,344
Should not be doing

2584
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,880
It's like we're living in

2585
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:55,648
I'd like

2586
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,440
You've never seen black book

2587
02:07:57,696 --> 02:08:00,000
We went and saw Dylan morning

2588
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:04,352
You remember the bridge

2589
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,632
What are the worst days of your life

2590
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:08,960
Famously loved

2591
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:12,032
In in his show Black Books

2592
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,848
There is a moment where he is really really sick

2593
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,408
And he's by himself any looks over it is oven

2594
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,944
And he sees the oven cleaner and goes

2595
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,992
If you can clean it up and you can clean me

2596
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,808
So much of how people think

2597
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,368
That is all that space

2598
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,696
But this caller does

2599
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,232
It's not good

2600
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:32,768
Anything else

2601
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,560
Yeah one thing I think

2602
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:36,864
Because I have a cement

2603
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:38,144
Asymmetrical Warfare

2604
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:38,912
Against

2605
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,728
And they're they're using our good graces

2606
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:42,752
Politeness

2607
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:43,520
Against

2608
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,080
Basically murdering Janice

2609
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,920
I need to see in the lightness be enough

2610
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,480
Data and information out there

2611
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:53,760
Doing some Nuremberg

2612
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:54,528
Two hanging

2613
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,320
I think if you want you star

2614
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:57,856
Doing one or two of those

2615
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,416
The people that are kind of like

2616
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:03,232
Well they told me to do it they're going to realize that

2617
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,256
They're culpable

2618
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,280
4

2619
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,584
Violating international law national law

2620
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,632
Amanda numerous local laws

2621
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,960
This is for Real

2622
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,264
And their life is on the line

2623
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:17,824
But I think that would be a major current

2624
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,616
I have a couple of concerns

2625
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:22,688
The First's are there local laws against genocide

2626
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:25,248
I don't know if like

2627
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,272
Lake County Board

2628
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,576
Cover that kind of maybe there is

2629
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,600
I don't know

2630
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:32,416
The second thing is this is

2631
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,464
Is dumb for a couple

2632
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,280
There's some stuff that we should talk about but

2633
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,840
This being on Infowars this is

2634
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:40,864
Because

2635
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,912
Nuremberg trials were like a world

2636
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,216
They should be against

2637
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:48,544
The idea of a Nuremberg

2638
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,568
For 2 because

2639
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,616
On principle

2640
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,408
They shouldn't even be in favor of

2641
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,176
The first one

2642
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,456
Becky it's

2643
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,992
It's strange it's

2644
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,808
It's kind of strange to me that this this formulation

2645
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:04,160
I thought you jogging a note that I was blown away

2646
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,696
By how we went

2647
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,464
From

2648
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:09,280
Because end I think this is how this dude thinks is like

2649
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:13,632
I guess it's because we're so polite that there were allowing them to hurt us

2650
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
Anyways

2651
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,936
We should hang them

2652
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,984
Like it is pulling this just

2653
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,776
Not hanging people

2654
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:23,104
It's something that Alex says a lot

2655
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,384
And that's that

2656
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:27,456
Probably with the caller is requiring back to has responded back

2657
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:31,296
Either we've we've been to cut we let them get

2658
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,320
To this point we let

2659
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,088
The globalist

2660
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:38,464
Do this by not killing them already know it was just Christians during the eighties were so quiet

2661
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,280
You know they just blew it nothing to say

2662
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,584
They let everything go to s*** you know

2663
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,888
Frankly handled the AIDS crisis

2664
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,680
Is better than anybody Emser

2665
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:52,032
It's also interesting that this caller starts with the letter

2666
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:55,616
Inhale bleach

2667
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,664
So they know if we're serious

2668
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:02,272
Let's poison ourselves and then kill everybody we don't like I don't understand what's wrong about

2669
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,088
So Alex has an interesting rebuttal

2670
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:08,672
To this guy he has a take on it that I think is

2671
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,952
A little bit weak

2672
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,512
I don't want anybody to go out

2673
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,048
And shoot

2674
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,888
Do you know any of these minions are or actual globalist

2675
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:21,472
Because it's a global system

2676
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,240
Spiritual

2677
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,312
They would use that as a project

2678
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,944
Are resistant to be Financial spiritual

2679
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,760
Physical in a nonviolent way

2680
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,320
Things like that

2681
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,160
But they

2682
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:41,952
Are going to go ahead

2683
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:44,256
Just keep moving at us in a violent way

2684
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:45,536
And showed a certain point

2685
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:48,096
We do need to take back some governmental systems and

2686
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:48,864
And then we do need

2687
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,680
People that do knowingly

2688
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,752
Population of sterilization weapons against the

2689
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,872
This is a strange take

2690
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:01,152
For Alex to have

2691
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:05,504
Cuz it's it's essentially like let's not kill these people instead

2692
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,832
Let's take over the apparatus of the state and then

2693
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,368
Use the state

2694
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,184
That way it'll be okay

2695
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:16,000
Counter to some of Alex's

2696
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:19,072
Large believe now and

2697
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:19,840
This is

2698
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:20,864
This is never happy

2699
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,704
So there's never been sort of like a

2700
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Opposition

2701
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,496
Action Party the

2702
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:29,824
Kind of a minority that decides to then over

2703
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,848
Overthrow the government

2704
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,384
And through the government

2705
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:33,920
Justify their actions

2706
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:37,760
Despite them being incredibly immoral

2707
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,296
Federal government overreach

2708
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:42,112
Right so I would assume that he's not talking about winning

2709
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:43,648
The presidency and then

2710
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,440
By using the Federal

2711
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,208
Crimes

2712
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:49,536
To prosecute these people obviously it's not International laws

2713
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,608
Believe that exist

2714
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,704
He's going to kill pouch

2715
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,312
Extradite

2716
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:04,640
Fauci Florida

2717
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:11,040
He's like let's overthrow the Texas governor in install the lieutenant governor is the Supreme Overlord of the

2718
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:12,064
Texas f******

2719
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,856
Ethnostate

2720
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,648
I'm sure you would have liked

2721
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,696
Dan Patrick more than a habit

2722
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:23,584
Oh yeah but yeah if this is weird I don't I don't I don't find any more comforting

2723
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,608
People because the

2724
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,888
The idea that he has

2725
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:28,448
More f***** up.

2726
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:30,752
Target these people we're going to have to

2727
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:33,824
First overthrow the government so we're going to kill a bunch of henchmen first

2728
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848
Civilian

2729
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:38,432
People not involve people who don't even really care conceivably

2730
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,712
Conceivably you could be talk

2731
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:42,784
I'm about like electoral politics

2732
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:48,160
Poopy talking about winning officer

2733
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,952
Did Rick Rick Reverend

2734
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,720
Shinsou

2735
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:55,328
Anyway Alex story about covid

2736
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,888
He's got a he's got to get into

2737
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:58,912
Good job

2738
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:00,704
On the news

2739
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:07,616
That's the reason you have covid symptoms even though

2740
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,200
Causing the coven

2741
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:16,064
Do covid-19 strains found

2742
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,112
With altered Spike

2743
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:19,648
Protein

2744
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,744
Breaking today

2745
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:26,304
One week after

2746
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:29,888
Soros arrested

2747
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:35,520
Which people said all those going to be new strange we need new vaccines the old ones didn't work

2748
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:36,288
Not quite

2749
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:39,616
This is only news because Alex doesn't understand the topic

2750
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:40,640
Buddy covers

2751
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,920
It's not surprising

2752
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:48,320
To see the possibility of a kovarian showing changes in the spike protein and that's part of what made

2753
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,368
More transmissible

2754
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,136
Stanley office

2755
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,160
I mean it's almost

2756
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,184
Inevitable

2757
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:57,024
French officials are investigating a new strain that they've detected but it

2758
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,072
Entirely clear as of yet how

2759
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:00,608
Print this train is going to end up being

2760
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:07,008
According to an article in a Reuters it looks like researchers are interested in how we can possibly hide from PCR test

2761
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,056
Since quotes several of the patient

2762
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:10,848
Since delivered negative PCR test

2763
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:16,224
And we're trying to positive result only from samples taken from blood or deep in the respiratory system

2764
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:18,528
However even if it does end up being

2765
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,552
McKay's

2766
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,600
France's Health Ministry said late on Monday

2767
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:25,696
Literally analysis did not suggest the mutation was more contagious

2768
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:27,488
Or more deadly than earlier version

2769
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,256
The virus

2770
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:33,888
There's a lot of information yet to be learned about this variant and it very well may turn out that it's

2771
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:37,216
It's not a huge deal and the vaccines we have are still effective against it

2772
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:37,984
So it's

2773
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,520
More less

2774
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,800
An academic issue

2775
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:43,616
Or it could turn out that its ability to evade

2776
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
PCR test

2777
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,944
Means that an alternative screening method might be

2778
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:47,968
Be needed in some case

2779
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:54,112
Those are possible that significant enough mutations to the spike protein would make it resistant to the vaccine

2780
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:56,672
But it's way too early to jump to that conclusion

2781
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:57,696
And that's what Alex

2782
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:00,000
Essentially doing

2783
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:05,120
Intentional are you telling me that it's way too early to jump to the conclusion that Bill Gates

2784
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:05,888
Finances

2785
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:08,960
The creation of a new variant of Delta

2786
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:11,520
Covet in order to

2787
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,312
Continue killing people

2788
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,104
And blame the Patriots

2789
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,128
Even though the facts

2790
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,664
He's already giving us

2791
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,944
Is going to give us

2792
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,712
A definite

2793
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:23,552
But he's also added something so you don't get heart attacks.

2794
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,320
Exactly

2795
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:27,648
Smorgasbord vaccine information

2796
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:30,976
Dizzy to buy

2797
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,792
Trying to keep some of it straight

2798
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,584
So Alex complains

2799
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:41,984
You know about this but also you should really know that he's not taking this very seriously it's not a big deal

2800
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,056
He is

2801
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,872
Having to spend time

2802
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,152
Energy

2803
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:51,712
Knowing we didn't do the things they said

2804
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,248
Killing lawyers

2805
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,296
Default us years ago

2806
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,368
Nobody's ever given them all their banking

2807
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,648
The judge is crazy

2808
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:01,952
Give Them All to him but they're going to default

2809
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:06,048
Because I wanted to show the world all that

2810
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,144
There and follow their political orders

2811
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,704
Outlandish

2812
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,264
I told him all that

2813
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:21,664
Is very seriously

2814
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:30,368
No idea that I already know all about the

2815
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:35,488
But I was born

2816
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:39,584
Researching this information and actually hearing family

2817
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,608
Walkabout

2818
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,400
Things that they witness themselves

2819
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,424
What

2820
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,704
What

2821
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,264
What does that have to do with taking this case

2822
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,824
I mean it's almost evidence that he's not

2823
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,104
The k-series

2824
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,200
Yeah

2825
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,016
Just

2826
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:59,040
I don't buy it

2827
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:00,320
I don't think this is a good

2828
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,344
The Avenue

2829
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,928
Promising promising to take more calls

2830
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:07,488
Sure promises he's going to get to it.

2831
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,376
And I will do the effort.

2832
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:15,424
Salmon in the world on shoulders coming up

2833
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:23,616
He got sued for Sandy Gun for reading of Zero Hedge article on air

2834
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:25,408
Questioning Megyn Kelly

2835
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,432
I think she was saying

2836
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:27,968
I just shoot him

2837
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:32,320
They just default to knowing

2838
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:35,904
He never gets me 94 even subpoenaed him to be default

2839
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,696
Well you can't even do that

2840
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:40,768
They just said

2841
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,304
Your default

2842
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,584
You're not even a person

2843
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,424
As a is very clear from our conversations with Mark Banks

2844
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:52,800
Tried to get Owens come in for a deposition and he did not respond

2845
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:57,152
So many times though this is a bulshit piece of nonsense Alex's

2846
02:18:57,664 --> 02:19:00,736
Is it spreading respond almost as if somebody might have

2847
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:01,760
You've told him

2848
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:06,112
It would be a bad idea for Ira's don't worry dues got this one exactly

2849
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,648
Yeah who's got the goods

2850
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:10,464
Oh boy so Alex said he's going to take calls

2851
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,744
Commercial

2852
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,048
I thought we're going to go right back to golf

2853
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,096
We do not immediately do that

2854
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:23,008
The Masters new type of warfare

2855
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:28,384
Comic cultural spiritual warfare slowly shutting down the economy

2856
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:29,408
And then

2857
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,248
Why you blaming the general public blaming White

2858
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:34,784
Are they

2859
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:37,344
What is it about white people the Volvo's don't like

2860
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:39,904
Christian ethos and what happened in the West

2861
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,184
About

2862
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:43,488
500 years ago the Renaissance the idea

2863
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:45,280
Person

2864
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:47,072
People having basic rides

2865
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,400
People having free speech people having right to a jury

2866
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:53,728
Gutenberg printing press

2867
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,056
What are we doing

2868
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,592
What is this

2869
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:00,896
Destroy

2870
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:07,040
Don't you understand the globalist

2871
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:08,320
White

2872
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:11,136
People the Library of Alexandria

2873
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:13,184
Would never have been

2874
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:17,280
I think is really interesting is the way of it like this

2875
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,816
Singular person

2876
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:22,144
Gutenberg

2877
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,704
Is Pratt's great man do you have history

2878
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:27,776
He came up with that idea out of nowhere

2879
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:34,176
Lexi movable-type Innovations now man ever thought of it before and I never thought of it before

2880
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:40,576
Hundreds of years before the process history is engagement

2881
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:44,672
Different cultures are in conversation with each other

2882
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,488
Well I guess you're right

2883
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,536
Like I don't have a

2884
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:51,072
If this is just

2885
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,376
Deeply deeply white supremacy

2886
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:54,912
F****** Wild

2887
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,704
F****** Wild

2888
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,800
Did not know the massive interplay of trade and

2889
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:01,824
Everett

2890
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,360
Between

2891
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,432
Furiated legalist

2892
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:09,248
The concepts that Alex's is fascinated by it

2893
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,784
Insisting that white people invent

2894
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,576
Did like the very basis of freedom

2895
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:13,856
What about snot

2896
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:19,488
Not based entirely or created a whole cloth by European cultures

2897
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:23,584
I mean it's it's Porsche it's like he said everybody in sumera was white

2898
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,376
Lakeshore

2899
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:26,656
Looking fine what are

2900
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:29,984
10 books

2901
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,544
Text wifey

2902
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,080
This sucks

2903
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:36,128
Yeah that really sucks

2904
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,152
Calls

2905
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:40,224
Why aren't you Skyler in Washington

2906
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:46,112
God bless you. Peace be with you in this war

2907
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:47,136
Near me

2908
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:50,464
Thank you I

2909
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,744
I just want to cover this end

2910
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,768
Beasty posted this

2911
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:54,048
New report

2912
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:57,120
Titled 100 kids in Virginia given wrong dose

2913
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:58,144
Call me back.

2914
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,168
But we know it

2915
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,448
Nationwide

2916
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,216
Charlie

2917
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:02,752
And

2918
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,032
Disturbing

2919
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,312
Walker try and cover it up

2920
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:07,104
They use this to

2921
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
Excuse

2922
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:11,456
Expelled

2923
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,736
And then I use this

2924
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:14,272
Excuse to say that they should reach

2925
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,808
Vaccine regimen

2926
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,600
Possibly more.

2927
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:22,976
Backstage

2928
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:30,656
It doesn't make any sense because this call her and Alex have the story backward

2929
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:36,032
They're saying that these hundred kids and Virginia were given an adult doses of the vaccine three times

2930
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:36,800
That's what they were supposed

2931
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:38,080
But that's not true

2932
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:41,152
In reality according to a story in the Washington Post quote

2933
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:45,504
The doses of Pfizer vaccine given at the clinic were diluted more than recommended

2934
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,784
According to the health

2935
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:52,416
It's not clear if this is what happened in this other case but in another incident and Luda

2936
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,952
County Virginia

2937
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,256
A pharmacy was administering incorrect dosist

2938
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,792
Children but their mistake

2939
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,840
How to make sense if you don't think about it too much

2940
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,888
Children's doses R1

2941
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,424
One-third of the standard dose

2942
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,192
So you might

2943
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:07,264
I think that you could dilute 1/3 of a standard dosage

2944
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,032
Just like that

2945
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:13,920
You cooked up a child here is that the experts don't actually know if that's something

2946
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,944
Invech woodwork

2947
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,992
Constable Ronald B okay

2948
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:20,832
But they're not they're concerned that this wouldn't deliver a full dose

2949
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:22,880
And they don't have the proper information

2950
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:24,672
So there's some concern

2951
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:27,232
If this is how the dosing is being done

2952
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:29,536
Yeah I imagine that

2953
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,560
If I

2954
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:34,144
The people who designed the vaccine

2955
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:40,544
Acknowledged that some pharmacist was just like oh well if I have three little cups I'll just pour a little bit of this vaccine

2956
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,568
Sitting there each one

2957
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:46,432
That's probably not the way you want to think the pharmacist probably doing it a little bit

2958
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:50,272
More carefully than describing

2959
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,040
Wasn't saying drink

2960
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:56,160
You know Alex and this caller are workshopping a

2961
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:58,464
Conspiracy theory about a story that they have in

2962
02:23:58,720 --> 02:23:59,488
Entirely wrong

2963
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,512
Yeah that's cheating

2964
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:03,840
What is the point of this show

2965
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:07,424
Things that are wrong and tell people they're right

2966
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:09,472
I guess so

2967
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:12,544
So Alex gets another call

2968
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:17,152
Forgot who's an investigative reporter and I thought I thought

2969
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:18,688
I thought I was very excited

2970
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:21,760
Hear from this investigator see what he has to say

2971
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,576
And then I quickly got disappointed also his name is Ragnarok

2972
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:26,624
Alex Jones

2973
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:27,904
Ragnarok here

2974
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,232
Florida I was just want to call in

2975
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,000
And

2976
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,072
Work for

2977
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:35,840
Orlando

2978
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:37,632
Examiner in Florida

2979
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,168
2000

2980
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,216
I was covering the

2981
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:41,984
Mama's minutes

2982
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,592
Pushing a lot of them

2983
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,432
I had

2984
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:51,200
One of these days

2985
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,248
Illuminati

2986
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,272
People

2987
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:55,040
Email me

2988
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:57,088
Commenting on my

2989
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:57,856
Particle

2990
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,416
This is about where I kind of decided

2991
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:04,256
You're not investigative

2992
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:09,888
What I'm saying is true the other 50

2993
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,960
And just rebelling what

2994
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,984
Freddy Cannon

2995
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
What I have

2996
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:20,640
I responded

2997
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:21,408
To that

2998
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:22,432
In kind

2999
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,968
Six months later after he said

3000
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
Send me that

3001
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:25,760
There's a great story

3002
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:26,528
1120

3003
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:27,296
Me too

3004
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
2010

3005
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:30,624
And I got

3006
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,672
Fired on 1123

3007
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:33,696
2010

3008
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:36,256
Twitter

3009
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,072
YouTube

3010
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,352
Google

3011
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:42,144
All of them called up

3012
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:44,192
Orlando examiner is if you don't

3013
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,216
This guy

3014
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:46,496
Going to terminate

3015
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,520
Contract

3016
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,824
At this point I'm pretty sure Alex's

3017
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:56,224
Does eating because he thought story and he's not interrupting it

3018
02:25:56,480 --> 02:26:00,832
Like building on anything not trying to derail

3019
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:03,136
Territorial

3020
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:10,304
I had a illuminati globalist send me an email and then I responded six months later that I was fired

3021
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,632
Surprised I'm not here

3022
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:17,472
I've been experiencing

3023
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,752
My voice

3024
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,568
For about 11 years

3025
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,384
Everything you're going through

3026
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:26,432
Through

3027
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:30,016
It's a battle we got on your hands

3028
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,232
Vaccination

3029
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,536
The mandatory vaccinations

3030
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,608
It says

3031
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:46,912
The creators

3032
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,216
Whoever takes

3033
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:50,496
You become

3034
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:53,568
Of the ones you have that pack

3035
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:59,200
We're doing that with that they own the genetic material and it's crazy

3036
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:00,224
Oh boy

3037
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,760
That was a long walk

3038
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:04,064
To get to atom theory

3039
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,832
Yep

3040
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:08,672
Yeah

3041
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,464
Yes all in all

3042
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:12,256
Myself

3043
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:14,560
In a position where this is

3044
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:15,584
Cregan

3045
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,352
Episode

3046
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:18,400
That's story

3047
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:20,960
Soured Beyond any hope of

3048
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:21,984
Pinterest

3049
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,520
Really put

3050
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:24,800
Some air brake

3051
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:28,384
On Alex's show Adara

3052
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,408
In

3053
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,176
2000

3054
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:35,808
10 I've already stopped caring and I kind of understand why Alex ends up doing what he does at this point

3055
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:37,856

Paying for all the DEA

3067
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:05,504
Pulling into count

Political opposition Arnel

All the time

3070
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:14,720
I'm here

3071
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:15,488
I have spent

3072
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,768
Millions of dollars

3073
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:19,840
Fighting these fraudulent Sandy Hook lawsuits

3074
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:24,192
In front of a jury

3075
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:25,472
It's too dangerous

3076
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:28,288
But users of dead children

3077
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,104
At the Sacramento

3078
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:34,688
We gave them all of our documents all of our bank records

3079
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,504
Things that have nothing to do with a defamation suit

3080
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:40,320
The judge in Texas and the judge

3081
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:41,088

To get my

3085
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:49,792
Alex is the victim

3086
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,096
I mean they did everything right

3087
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:54,912
Didn't say that you failed to give them.

3088
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:56,960
They got

3089
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:57,984
Plenty of.

3090
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:58,752
Document song

3091
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:02,080
Summer

3092
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:02,848
Were

3093
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,664
Suspicious Sarah wild way too many documents

3094
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,688
Situation

3095
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:08,992
So I mean he just did everything

3096
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:12,832
Egregious

3097
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:15,648
They're taking our first amendment rights away

3098
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:20,512
It's so egregious that it's going to turn people on like it's going to wake people love buck up

3099
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,048
Obviously

3100
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:24,864
Because the establishment is in its death throes

3101
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:26,656
Edgewalk control America

3102
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:30,240
Target leaders of the populace.

3103
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:31,008
Opposition

3104
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:33,056
Demonization

3105
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,640
Intimidate

3106
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:43,808
In England

3107
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:45,088
Is it

3108
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,768
This is nothing

3109
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:53,792
What is judicial

3110
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:57,120
Intimidate me and others respond

3111
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,424
I'm going to put

3112
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,448
Films

3113
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:09,152
I don't think

3114
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:11,200
That's going to

3115
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:14,784
Times he said he was going to make more documentaries of work already

3116
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,808
Even what he had

3117
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:18,368
Plenty of money and said what he did was buy a fuk

3118
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,928
Yeah so the bombing of Britain

3119
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,232
During WWII lasted over 8 months

3120
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:25,792
1940 to 1941

3121
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,120
United Kingdom declared war on Germany in 1939

3122
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:30,656
30 happened

3123
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:35,264
I'm going to need to see Alex light some sources on this 90% against to 90%

3124
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,056
4 figure in terms of British

3125
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,080
Support for the war cuz I

3126
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,104
I can't find anything

3127
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:39,872
Comes close to that

3128
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:43,456
There was a spike and more Allen support for the war

3129
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,480
At the end of the blind

3130
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:48,832
But it also coincided with when the Soviet Union officially enter the war

3131
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,368
These motivators could be working in

3132
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:51,648
In concert together

3133
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:55,232
Also there was a spike when the US join the war so I mean like there is

3134
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,768
Historical things

3135
02:30:57,024 --> 02:31:00,096
Yeah anyway the point Alex is making about Germany hoping

3136
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:05,984
To demoralize the British with a blitz but that only making them more in favor of the Warriors maybe someone

3137
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:08,288
But only if you interpreted really generously

3138
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:11,360
Also an important point is that the enthusiasm

3139
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:16,736
In Britain went up when the blitz ended not while the bombing campaign was still active

3140
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:18,784
This Dynamic kind of hurts Alex

3141
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,088
This metaphor but I don't want to put too many hairs it's just

3142
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,904
It's something that he brings up over and over and over again

3143
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:26,208
The only really has maybe a hundred

3144
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,488
Sort of word block

3145
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:34,400
Fits that man where they need to go

3146
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:35,936
Pick a word block

3147
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:41,056
Write a metaphor

3148
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,080
More life

3149
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:44,896
So anyway Alice's. He does this

3150
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:47,456
Think that they plays his is statement

3151
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:48,480
And it's just

3152
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:49,504
More of the same

3153
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,040
Deserted like I got that up

3154
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:57,696
Since 1990

3155
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:59,488
This is what they have been working

3156
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:03,328
Towards Dan yeah it should have happened within five years but

3157
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:09,728
Timing was off I think they f***** around did 911 look there 10 years behind we all know that there

3158
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:11,264
Plans are always right

3159
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:15,104
I got some some other stuff got in the way

3160
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:15,872
So Alex

3161
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:18,176
Brings on this guy named

3162
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:19,456
Drew Hernandez

3163
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:21,760
And he is a guy who is

3164
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:22,784
Is an activist

3165
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,808
On the right

3166
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:25,344
A big s*******

3167
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:28,416
And he presents himself as a journalist kind of

3168
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:29,952
Like lives

3169
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:30,976
Stream stuff

3170
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:33,280
He happened to be in Kenosha live streaming

3171
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:36,352
Been called as a defense Witness

3172
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:39,424
In The Rittenhouse trial

3173
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:41,984
There have been some concerns

3174
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,008
About him being

3175
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:43,776
A little bit

3176
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:45,056
Too much of a bias

3177
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:50,944
Agree with those concerns

3178
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,248
Is I'm not biased to anything except the truth

3179
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,808
And my rebuttal to that would be a buddy

3180
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:58,112
You're on Infowars

3181
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:58,880
You got problems

3182
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:00,160
You are biased against

3183
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:01,184
The truth

3184
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:05,024
Play Alex has a little bit of a bull session with this guy who's

3185
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,584
Dangerously close to being offered a job

3186
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:13,728
What you talked about how the left and wokeism is a new religion

3187
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,288
Swab came out today is going to be a speech

3188
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:19,104
EWTN

3189
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:20,640
Bilderberg Group

3190
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:25,504
Of all those bubbles organization

3191
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,272
A president

3192
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:27,808
Sherwin the board

3193
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:32,160
Openly said we're creating a new religion of the Earth

3194
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:35,744
Everybody hits the religion were humans are bad and Evil

3195
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:38,048
Going to make sure

3196
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:42,144
For the good of the earth I mean this is

3197
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:45,216
A very Authority in system for the elaborate

3198
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:47,264
On your point about how they are in a

3199
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,032
Price of religion

3200
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:50,336
That's a really good point

3201
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:55,712
Does it mean when you take a look at this from like a Biblical worldview that's the endgame

3202
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:57,504
Lucifer and forsake

3203
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:59,552
Now we're going to get into something ology because

3204
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,624
That's what is going to happen with the Advent of the anti

3205
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:06,464
Christ he is going to be a superstar that is going to unify the world

3206
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:11,840
Usher in a one-world religion One World economy and one world system

3207
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:16,704
And we are seeing this unfold right now I'm not saying that we are literally living

3208
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:21,056
In the Book of Revelation right now cuz there are some precursors that need to take place

3209
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:25,152
According to the Bible but we we are literally watching right now is

3210
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:27,968
Referred to as the spirit of the anti

3211
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,528
I Christ because this is the grand finale

3212
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:32,576
Before the second coming of Jesus Christ

3213
02:34:32,832 --> 02:34:33,344
Oh boy

3214
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:39,232
So quickly application close Rob isn't the head of the World Trade Organization

3215
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:41,536
The Alex all of these

3216
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:42,560
They organization

3217
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:46,400
Asians are basically the same thing so it doesn't really matter

3218
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:50,752
Also cluster I was giving a speech at World economic

3219
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:53,824
Make Forum Summit that took place last weekend and you didn't save it

3220
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:57,408
Things I want to say this is clearly insane

3221
02:34:57,664 --> 02:34:58,432
Also

3222
02:34:58,688 --> 02:35:01,248
I don't know if you remember this but I was listening to this I remember

3223
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:05,344
I hate this guy yeah I remember him being like journalist baby that's

3224
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,184
He's one of the journalist baby

3225
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:12,256
Sounds like a whiny baby

3226
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:13,792
Yeah I got really annoyed

3227
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,328
Can't believe

3228
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:16,864
Leave that you up

3229
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,656
Ayers Ayers the thing about

3230
02:35:18,912 --> 02:35:19,680
Being a witness

3231
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:23,008
I understand cuz the judge

3232
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:23,776
Is a piece of s***

3233
02:35:24,032 --> 02:35:24,544
And that

3234
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:25,824
Not Unusual

3235
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:28,384
But I mean if I'm on a jury

3236
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:29,664
I would like

3237
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,456
The defense to always Quest

3238
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:34,528
Are there anybody to always question their Witnesses

3239
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,344
Do you believe that it's Lucifer's plan

3240
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,624
What's happening right

3241
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:41,696
Cuz if that's the case then I don't care what you have to

3242
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:47,072
Do you believe that when you were at the protest in Kenosha

3243
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:49,376
Do you believe that the devil was involved

3244
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:50,912
Believe

3245
02:35:51,168 --> 02:35:53,216
That this is part of end times prophecy

3246
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:58,848
Absolutely State of Mind you were in

3247
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,152
Affect how you experience things

3248
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,456
I mean I don't even care if it's Mike

3249
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:06,272
That's the information I don't believe you

3250
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:09,856
I just think this guy sounds like a baby

3251
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:12,416
How much further does it need to go

3252
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:18,048
Better than

3253
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,376
For your own babies your own children that goes beyond politics

3254
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:22,656
Wavy on politics

3255
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:27,776
Radeon democrat-republican

3256
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:30,336
It's even when people think that they can dictate

3257
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:32,128
And control

3258
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,432
For your own babies over you as a parent

3259
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:36,736
How the hell could you ever allow that

3260
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:40,320
Universe

3261
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,672
Oh my God

3262
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,464
Oh my God

3263
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:53,376
If you don't saying

3264
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:55,424
Pre-planned because God knew it was going to happen but

3265
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:58,240
Yeah I thought you doesn't mean death or Grim Reaper

3266
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:01,056
The name is derived from the Sicilian word for sickle

3267
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:04,128
The name comes from people who had the occupation of

3268
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:05,664
Sickles having that name

3269
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,504
Much like Smith or Miller or occupational rooted name I was going to say

3270
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,808
It's like an agricultural us-based

3271
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:14,624
Like they got something by the last name farmer

3272
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:21,024
Perfect sort of information for Alex to throw around because it means nothing but it has a tendency to blow idiots

3273
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:21,792
Mines

3274
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,096
I mean

3275
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,376
Just just that

3276
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:26,912
Some people just can't

3277
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:28,704
Biore

3278
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:30,240
You know

3279
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:32,800
It's not your skill it's not your skill but this this

3280
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:34,592
I don't know how good they look

3281
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:37,152
How many wood do people touch their baby

3282
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:39,456
Play call my God

3283
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:42,272
This guy too

3284
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:44,064
Have a credibility problem

3285
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:44,832
I find him

3286
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:45,600
To have

3287
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:47,904
A bias problem I think he's annoying

3288
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,696
That doesn't really affect

3289
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:50,720
The judicial Park

3290
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:53,280
No also I think that

3291
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:56,608
Him saying things like this next clip that I'm going to play

3292
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:58,400
I think this is a problem

3293
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:01,984
For him being involved as a witness for the defense

3294
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:07,360
He's going to talk about one of the people who got shot 10 people that Rittenhouse killed

3295
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,408
This is a person who has

3296
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:10,432
Some

3297
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:12,992
A history of abuse against children

3298
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:14,272
Perpetrator

3299
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,088
Okay it is exaggerated by Alex

3300
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,624
And

3301
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,648
True but I

3302
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:22,720
Minimizing the fact that he's a part of

3303
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:25,792
Now here is what he says

3304
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
Just awful

3305
02:38:28,352 --> 02:38:31,680
How do we get to this point child molesters

3306
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:32,960
Show me open

3307
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:35,008
Joseph Rosenbaum is

3308
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:35,776
And what

3309
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:41,920
Exactly why they didn't want the trial because they knew if the jury know this

3310
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:43,456
Jacqueline

3311
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:47,552
Because my house was a minor

3312
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:52,160
When Joseph Rosenbaum was charging him from behind

3313
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:53,440
That's

3314
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,768
Something that I think is impeachable as a witness

3315
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,840
Him expressing a mentality that maybe the

3316
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:01,120
The jury would decide the

3317
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:03,168
He deserve to die because of past

3318
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:03,936
Actions

3319
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:07,520
I I just don't I don't think

3320
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:09,568
You should be anywhere near that courtroom

3321
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:10,848
That's f***** up

3322
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:11,872
That's just f***

3323
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:16,736
I think being on Infowars is bad enough but then when you're expressing these kinds of

3324
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:17,760
Opinions it's

3325
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:20,064
I I just don't I

3326
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,648
Because he's basically implying

3327
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:24,928
That

3328
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:26,208
It's okay

3329
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:32,608
If it turns out after the fact that something about a person

3330
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:39,008
After the fact that's crazy

3331
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:42,592
People and then I put somebody off a cliff and then I was in court and they were like

3332
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:48,992
But did you know this guy was also a murderer I'd be like see I'm totally off the hook now maybe the jury

3333
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:55,392
You would think he deserves a hero here

3334
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:56,928
The law

3335
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:00,000
The jury wouldn't be like aha

3336
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:05,376
I don't care about the person he killed

3337
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:11,776
No, again

3338
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:17,152
Solutely mature adult person

3339
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:23,808
Alex is a

3340
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:24,832
The word my man

3341
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:29,184
America he need to wake up

3342
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:29,952
What's the reality

3343
02:40:30,208 --> 02:40:31,488
Look at the culture

3344
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:34,560
Look at education look at politics

3345
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:37,376
Look at the Grand scale look at the entire world

3346
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,144
Look at the

3347
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,448
Justice system the so-called justice system

3348
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,984
It's all being subverted

3349
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:45,824
Right now you need to stand up for what's true for what's righteous and what's honest

3350
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,104
Because it's either now

3351
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:47,872
Or it's never

3352
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:53,504
God

3353
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:59,392
That seems also impeachable as a as a witness if he has these beliefs about the justice system

3354
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:01,440
It doesn't it I don't know

3355
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:03,488
I'm not

3356
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:06,048
I'm not happy about any of this

3357
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:09,120
Speech I was longing for the story from 2000

3358
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:15,520
Bring back Ragnarok

3359
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,128
Anyway

3360
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:21,920
I think

3361
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:26,528
This is actually exactly what you kind of

3362
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:27,808
Expect

3363
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:32,928
Deflecting saying I did everything right. To blame these people Jambi up

3364
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
If it's fraud

3365
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:34,976
That's exactly what you

3366
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:35,744
Should expect once

3367
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,560
It's over there's no reason to be angry anymore

3368
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,328
Like that

3369
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,352
Greer is

3370
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:43,680
Yeah useful sales motivation until the actual

3371
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:44,704
Door is shut

3372
02:41:46,752 --> 02:41:47,520
Just a matter of

3373
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:48,800
PR campaigns

3374
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:50,592
To make sure that your revenue streams

3375
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:51,616
From the audience

3376
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:52,896
Doesn't dry out

3377
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:56,480
I think he's doing exactly what he needs to do on that front

3378
02:41:56,992 --> 02:41:58,016
He's also being

3379
02:41:58,272 --> 02:41:59,296
Over Glee

3380
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,880
Also

3381
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:03,904
Being real stupid

3382
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,440
Android

3383
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:06,976
Be hanging out with her

3384
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:07,744
Baby

3385
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:10,304
You know here's something weird

3386
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:13,376
This just this thought just occurred to

3387
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:14,144
A-OK

3388
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,192
Alex

3389
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:20,288
If the vaccines do murder everybody

3390
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,360
Will be off the hook

3391
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:30,784
So shouldn't he be rooting for people to take the vaccine if he believes that people who take the vaccine will die

3392
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:32,064
Guess who took the vaccine

3393
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:33,088
Judges

3394
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,112
Jerry's

3395
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,136
Lawyers

3396
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:36,928
Shouldn't he be like

3397
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:38,464
Hey everybody

3398
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,488
That I don't like

3399
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:40,768
B vaccine

3400
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,048
Well no because he

3401
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:43,328
He believes in humanity

3402
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:45,888
Cuz he loves people

3403
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:47,424
And he doesn't want to

3404
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,704
That was the closest

3405
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,776
Taking a good long while

3406
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,568
Integrity

3407
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:56,896
Decency love of fellow man honestly

3408
02:42:59,712 --> 02:43:00,736
Yep

3409
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,040
So we end this

3410
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:09,952
Sort of state where I think we're in a holding pattern until we know kind of what the damage

3411
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:10,976
Is there going to be

3412
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:12,000
Because I think

3413
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:13,280
If there

3414
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:14,560
Considerable

3415
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,120
Alex might be in very big trouble

3416
02:43:17,632 --> 02:43:18,656
If it's not

3417
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:19,936
He might be able to

3418
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:21,984
F*** around and have some

3419
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,008
Money bombs

3420
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:25,312
And maybe make enough money to

3421
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:26,336
Coast Brew

3422
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:27,104
Maybe

3423
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,128
No cuts

3424
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:31,200
Maybe slim down a little bit

3425
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:34,528
I don't know I just can't think of any way to

3426
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:37,088
Go to a jury with anything other than

3427
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,624
And Infowars

3428
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:40,160
You know what I mean like

3429
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:41,184
Listen

3430
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,720
This is not going to

3431
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:44,000
To stop unless we stop it

3432
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:48,096
You know what I'm saying so we have to either either he stops Infowars

3433
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:48,864
Or we

3434
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:51,168
Awarded judgement so high that he has to stay

3435
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:53,984
That seems to be the only

3436
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:58,848
Option for me otherwise what's the point of any I understand where you're coming from I just don't know if that flies in

3437
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:01,664
I agree with that

3438
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:03,968
I agree with that but I mean honestly what's

3439
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:04,992
What's the point of any of this

3440
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:08,064
If he's allowed to continue doing it

3441
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,088
What's the f******

3442
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:10,368
You know

3443
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,160
Yeah I mean I guess

3444
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,184
The point

3445
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,208
I would

3446
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:14,976
Want

3447
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:18,048
To seek is whatever it is

3448
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,352
That the families who were

3449
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:21,120
Suing him

3450
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:24,704
Watch

3451
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:25,984
You're absolutely right on

3452
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:30,336
I think I think that

3453
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:32,128
You know I don't

3454
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:34,176
People might

3455
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:35,712
Expect the Derby like a big

3456
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:36,480
Change

3457
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:37,504
I was like

3458
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,272
Is tone

3459
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:39,040
Because he lost

3460
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:40,832
The suit solutely not snot

3461
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:42,624
But I mean that's kind of my point

3462
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:45,440
This behavior isn't going to stop

3463
02:44:45,952 --> 02:44:46,720
Because he gets

3464
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:47,488
A

3465
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:48,256
Huge judge

3466
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:53,632
This behavior is going to continue for as long as he doesn't show the only option

3467
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,656
To make this

3468
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,424
A

3469
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,192
When

3470
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:57,472
Is to end info

3471
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:01,312
If he does and Infowars then you could just do a podcast

3472
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:03,616
Absolutely

3473
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:07,712
I'm just saying that that's what I would be

3474
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:10,016
Understand

3475
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:11,552
I don't know where we'll see what happens

3476
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:15,392
But for now Jordan we have a website

3477
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:22,048
Yep we are also on Twitter we are on Twitter at that knowledge underscore fighting that go to bed Jordan

3478
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:24,864
Also we had intended to not have an episode

3479
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:26,144
Today

3480
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:28,704
Because I wanted a little break

3481
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,496
This Sneaky Snake was so sneaky

3482
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:31,776
It's stuck up on us

3483
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:39,456
You know X necessitated us having an episode so if you've made it this far

3484
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:40,224
Sewed on Friday

3485
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:46,624
We'll see we might have an episode on Friday

3486
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:51,232
We might but Bonito

3487
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:52,256
I'm Leo mdzs

3488
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:53,024
Text Clark

3489
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:56,096
And now here comes

3490
02:45:56,608 --> 02:45:57,120
The sex robot

3491
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:02,496
Alex

3492
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:05,311
