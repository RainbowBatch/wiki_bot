00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
Jones

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordans

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
You ever played a likely place

8
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,616
Lot of people from the area

9
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
One guy in specifically Euchre I don't know I don't know if it's

10
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
But there was a card game called Dutch Blitz

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
Card game

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Join.

13
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Colleges where they bet

14
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Kenosha

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
East high intensity game

16
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
Card game where you trying to

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Stack numbers on top of

18
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
It's crazy

19
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
Winning hands or anything like that it's really

20
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
And it leads to fights its

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
It's really there's a lot of accusation

22
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
The cheating

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
It's never a good time

24
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
No good

25
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
I resent

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
But

27
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
The Box

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,720
It does say that is a vonderful good game

29
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Death Race

30
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,144
Check it out

31
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
The crises come from playing it

32
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
And I do lava rocks

33
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
We are in the present-day a little bit

34
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,832
Figure out what we're going to cover on today's episode

35
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
Wacky Wednesday

36
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
I came up

37
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
I considered covering

38
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
Publix

39
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Noted anti-semite Owen Benjamin

40
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Good things about Hitler

41
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Alien versus Predator situation

42
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
So I consider listening to Owen Benjamin live streams about Alex and I realized

43
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
Play him like a drunk and an idiot

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,328
Which is fun really f***** up stuff that

45
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,424
So I figured like that's no good let's stay around in the present

46
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
So today we're going to be looking at October C

47
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
16th 2019

48
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
Isaac is a really messed up

49
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Episode of Alex's

50
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,712
Worthwhile for us to go over at even if it we just did do a present day episode on once

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,088
I don't think there's a different to dinner by the bridge

52
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Hungover

53
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
He may be a little bit depressed

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
But

55
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Real dangerous trend

56
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
To pay attention to

57
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Lupe is suggest makeup

58
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Portend

59
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
Butter

60
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Books are signed up in

61
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,943

62
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295

00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
Amapola

68
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
I'm a policy wonk

69
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Yeah probably

70
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
So first of all Peter from Denmark

71
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
And second Mary Catherine

72
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
You are now both wonderful technocrat

73
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
The business

74
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Heroin

75
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Is freakishly large from Denmark

76
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,039
Mary Catherine

77
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Specifically singular heaters

78
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Nothing

79
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Conspiracy of Peters

80
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
No no it would be

81
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
It would be a plus repeater

82
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,191
Good thank you so much

83
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,567
If you're out there listening as hey I would like to join the conspiracy of Christmas

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
Famous Chris

85
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
Peter I like that

86
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
Sports

87
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
Alright Jordan let's get down to business

88
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Today Show

89
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,775
I only have one question for you

90
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
Despite its stupidity because I want to see how this show is going to end

91
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
That's the sort of mode he's in at the end list

92
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
F****** around nonsense

93
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Circle like a sort of b*******

94
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,495
Not far off it's mostly important

95
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
Because as we get started with the episodes

96
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Completely different

97
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,967
I do know that that's where it's heading to value

98
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Grandiose

99
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
About

100
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
At the beginning

101
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
Has like this real sense

102
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
You're very serious

103
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Message

104
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
And purpose to

105
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Just minutes ago

106
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
In the control room standing over one of the Riders

107
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Today's live show to put a page out everyday that has a life

108
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Feed

109
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
How's the right there

110
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,039
Infowars.com easy to share that way

111
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Tennessee magically says

112
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
What the broadcast

113
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
Bill's where there's a quote from there

114
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
This will be the most important

115
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Broadcast

116
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,311
Most important

117
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Levi's

118
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Ken Jost

119
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Execute

120
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Laying out the information of calm

121
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Recent weigh

122
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
President

123
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,023
So much for the days after the Boston bombings the most important broadcast I've ever done

124
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,375
Am I pretty good

125
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Self-immolated

126
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Episode

127
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,079
Nopi just dicks around with Sargon of akkad

128
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
So that's again

129
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Where we Envy episode

130
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
The most important broadcast ever if he's able to focus and execute his plan

131
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,647
Makes it

132
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
You might ask why

133
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
Is this day so important

134
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Eventually Alex does have an answer

135
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
I've been very frustrated last few months on air

136
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
And affair

137
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
My mind's been working

138
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Like a splinter

139
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Inside of it

140
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Wanting to

141
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
To defeat

142
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
In Plainview

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,351
Conscious mind simply

144
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Couldn't grasp

145
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Longhorn

146
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
As I was laying

147
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
For Westerville Ohio

148
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
I just had

149
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Great restful sleep

150
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
I woke up at 6 a.m. this morning

151
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
New

152
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Mission

153
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Need to be carried out

154
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
This is

155
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Real weird

156
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Alex is the globalist

157
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Figured it out

158
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Who you know what else could feel like

159
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Maybe he has a tumor

160
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
I don't know

161
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,463
What we got to do it's been in Plainview I couldn't

162
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,095
Except it would like whatever your plan is

163
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
It's either going to be the most disappointing

164
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,055
Right thing ever

165
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
Wade Hughes the getting into the subject

166
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,991
You know what it's super easy but we just couldn't bear to see the

167
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Dissolution

168
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
You know what I realized I realize that we need to live in the now guys we spend too much

169
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
And the now says

170
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Murder everyone feel like it could be anywhere on that Spectrum front right self-help too overt

171
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Play like

172
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
It's wartime

173
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
Good or whatever call Dad

174
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,991
I didn't know where this is going to go we learned that I guess

175
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Defeating globalist

176
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,415
Involves a ritual or something I'm not tired this is a little confusing

177
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
10:00 this morning

178
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
My brain when I was working out

179
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
That vision of understanding that I knew

180
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Carry out this ritual

181
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Realized

182
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,671
This is what the enemy fears more than anything

183
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
And this is what

184
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
Night and day they work to make sure you never discover

185
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,727
We're not specific at this point at all

186
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
I am on the edge of my seat

187
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Because like

188
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
This is I'm so used to being

189
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,199
Disappointed

190
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Me too much

191
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
But I was like

192
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
What is he going to

193
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Advocate for

194
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
Because the way he's building this up is the most important show I've ever done

195
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
I had the piffany on the easy way to defeat the globalist

196
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,167
It's a it's a ritual and the globalist are afraid of talking about this ritual

197
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
I called this could go bad directions

198
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Probably saw something who knows

199
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
Scorpio most of his career

200
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
Child's Play compared to what we're gonna do now

201
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
Is Child's Play

202
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Nothing Preparatory events

203
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Setting the stage

204
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
And whether Abdullah

205
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Answer

206
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
You

207
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Like a plant

208
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
I'm starting to think maybe it's just about acceptance

209
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,743
This is all just like a really dramatic

210
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
Call today to come down in

211
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
What do they call them

212
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Set a reminder

213
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,639
It's just that where my head's at now is I'm listen to

214
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
More like other regular

215
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
It must

216
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
To be clear by headset

217
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,879
This is just you didn't have much to talk about

218
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
You probably weren't paying attention to the debate so you don't really have

219
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
Anything to cover their other than your normal stuff about

220
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie and

221
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Blah blah blah

222
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
You have a different job

223
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,823
Supposed to be

224
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,943
He's just rambling about that week I had an epiphany that we could defeat the globalist by accepting Jesus

225
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
Isn't that something you would saying for a long time it doesn't seem like this is the fruit of a

226
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
Very much

227
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Just performing

228
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Gravity putting on

229
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Is it tree in the river that covered in blood that we have to do cuz Thomas Jefferson but

230
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,311
Yeah

231
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
From contacts

232
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
Lead me to believe he's just going to be like so we accept Jesus but he's not been

233
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Specific

234
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Another

235
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Whatever

236
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
Anything's possible but he's still not specific

237
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Break

238
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Butox a little more

239
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,631
I have been spending the last three months or so very very frustrated

240
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,727
With an idea that I knew was hiding in

241
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Front of me

242
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
But my subconscious

243
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
And my spirit

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
What's hiding from it

245
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Responsibility

246
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Also

247
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
I am ashamed of myself

248
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
That's really the truth

249
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
I tell you this because it's important to understand that

250
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Understand why all of us

251
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
Who don't openly consciously

252
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Still

253
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Chad Duvall

254
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
And it's a riddle

255
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
The answer to

256
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Keys

257
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
To Eternity

258
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,495
So you're still not clear starting to get those

259
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Sort of

260
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
Echoes of the other day like a couple days back Alex saying God is calling him to declare

261
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,319
I don't know if that's necessarily the way he put it

262
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
But I'm starting to get little

263
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,207
Little kernels of that feel like

264
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
Alex are you building up to declare yourself a religion

265
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
Just l

266
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Specific I don't know what he's talking about

267
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Text Cliff Alex

268
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Admit

269
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
But all along

270
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Please don't have to defeat

271
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
In a raises the question why haven't you text me the first question I would ask

272
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
I have known

273
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
How to defeat the globalist

274
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
Claim

275
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Vibrate

276
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Defeat

277
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Satan's world

278
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
You're all going to say well of course text

279
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Fontspace

280
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Asia

281
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Speaks for itself weaponize rare

282
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Is truth

283
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
But knowing

284
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
What's true

285
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
His only

286
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
Ben wants to know that true that you hide from

287
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
Shut the fuk up on the phone responsibilities

288
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Place

289
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
God's will must be done

290
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,047
So when you start talkin like that must be done eating from what must be done

291
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Birthright is involved a b word

292
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,799
Also the connotation of like

293
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Claim this leadership role

294
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,319
Days prior about God calling him to declare himself a leader

295
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
This quote-unquote epiphany

296
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Exist Within

297
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
The context

298
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
And that's troubling

299
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Yeah

300
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Going to be like

301
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Now

302
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
What's the Holocaust

303
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
So bad

304
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751
I mean you're using exaggeration but like

305
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,639
Talk especially people of the sort of

306
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Inclination

307
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Did Alex

308
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
It has

309
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
About done

310
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
It's generally not like positive things

311
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,439
It usually has like we're pretending we don't want violence for a long time

312
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
Our enemies are demons so f*** it

313
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
What must be done is going and getting ice cream

314
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
He's not going to

315
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
To go into that direction

316
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
He's not saying

317
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Overtly or explicitly like

318
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Got to do this violence or anything like that

319
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
But these tone these these

320
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
These beams that are coming up in the ways of presenting this religious

321
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Are just

322
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Trouble

323
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,231
You usually don't see them outside of the really negative Conte

324
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
We should not come

325
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,143
Wink wink

326
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
So Alex

327
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
Now gets to a little bit more specific

328
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
Like if you really listen to

329
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
What he's saying here about these

330
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Demon anime

331
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
That he has

332
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
I think I think you're fine

333
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
I'm pretty troubling

334
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
The Enemy by being abused as children or having genetic

335
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
A lot of different ways

336
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
Themselves

337
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Operating system

338
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Spirit

339
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,295
To be able to throw off any connection God

340
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
And you willfully

341
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,208
So far from God so they can be with

342
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Willfully

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
We're switching to Linux

344
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
We have to

345
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Consciously decide to be with.

346
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
Okay so there's a prescription sort of that we have to talk

347
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
The same thing you talk about all this

348
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
But as soon as I like started talking on this episode was just going to end up being an Evangelical

349
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Everything is

350
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,720
His big Revelation this breakthrough seems to be

351
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
And so his buddies have to be that much more

352
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
That's a huge disappointment

353
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,448
You know but it always rebuild something off at all it's never not a dud

354
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:07,104
However

355
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
And this is not something I've heard him talk about in the

356
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,760
The least interest training and loss

357
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
I've no idea what that means but I assume he watched Eyes Wide Shut recently

358
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,048
The other two examples about how people prepare and willfully doing these things to get into Satan

359
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
There's super f***** up

360
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Sincere about what he's putting into the world I think

361
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
Just makes me bigger monster than even we give him

362
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Credit score

363
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,336
Cuz apparently being a survivor of childhood abuse is preparation for being into Satan

364
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
According to Alex

365
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Callous and cruel as Alex

366
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Steven from him

367
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
That's a shocking

368
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,368
Statement that tube really really f***** up thing 22b

369
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,440
Part of preparation to go away from God

370
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
That is troubling is that idea is

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
I think his other examples probably worse

372
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
What's a genetic

373
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Predisposition for getting into Satan

374
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
Exactly just Jeanette explain to that at all

375
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
There's no way that what he's saying isn't it

376
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,992
Sorts of people are just biologically susceptible

377
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,088
I would love for him to clarify exactly what sort of genetic link

378
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Discovered here but I think

379
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Haven't listened to as much of his show as I have I already know that

380
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
See them right away if you know what I mean

381
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
WinCo

382
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,520
Fatima three ways you given here for how people become part of his enemies are completely out of their can

383
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
Being the victim of a crime

384
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
And the other is based on

385
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
I don't understand

386
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
Yells about free will all the time and all that is just

387
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
Lumping people around like this

388
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
The guy I just

389
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
I think it's really sucked out

390
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
Well I mean I guess the idea behind that

391
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
If they don't have any choice

392
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
To do it then

393
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Not their choice to

394
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
You stop doing it

395
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Same way

396
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
I think everybody's a d

397
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
He's removing

398
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Agency from all of his enemy

399
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
So they do know

400
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,392
Do anything

401
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Disposed

402
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
When he's

403
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Press to the wall

404
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
In the middle of his bizarre religious Tran

405
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
At the beginning of this episode

406
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Slow rap

407
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
Irrational

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,496
The three things that he's able to come up with examples for like rituals that

409
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,592
People willingly willfully go through it

410
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
Those examples

411
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
And I just don't I don't think

412
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
You can

413
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,296
I don't think that you can live in

414
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Well

415
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
And hold those sorts of beliefs

416
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
What's up

417
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
Euchre you get hit a lot

418
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
While you have to recite

419
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,144
I'm pretty sure that's the names of cereal you know that pretty sure that's how it

420
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Yeah

421
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
So Alex is talked a little bit about this like

422
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Why if this answer is

423
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Easy why won't people go for it

424
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
And it's because of

425
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
You feel ashamed

426
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Because you're in the presence of God

427
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
Fall program

428
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
That I remember

429
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Manipulate you

430
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
To feel like you're not worthy

431
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,104
Communion with God and that you're not worthy

432
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
Christian the person

433
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Something

434
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,952
Because it's so magnificent and so time was

435
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
And so powerful

436
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
You want to crawl under a rock

437
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
The coaches just want to get

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Completely

439
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
I just hear their Alex talking about like

440
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
More or less a rationalization

441
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,384
For himself declared himself a religious

442
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,272
Because because of

443
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:35,648
Presence of God because

444
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,744
Like it it feels like he's talking about things that held him back

445
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
From declaring himself a religious leader

446
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
Feeling like s***

447
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,192
I feel a psychodrama being played out for Less

448
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,264
In the context of projecting it onto

449
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,056
Believers in the audience

450
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Right right right

451
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
It's obvious

452
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
If

453
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
Like 90% +

454
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Evangelicals

455
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Voted for and support Trump

456
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
No matter what

457
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
The average Chris

458
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Is full of s***

459
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
In League with the Devil

460
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
I think he's

461
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
He's a saint

462
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
That's right

463
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
I don't know

464
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Mexico

465
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,712
So you talk about Solutions just on his face

466
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Is the solution

467
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
Close to God

468
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah but what's the final

469
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,160
View

470
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
And should lead you and guide you enter Direct

471
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,864
God is in you you will go out like a heat-seeking missile

472
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
You will go out and you want

473
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
A Magic Touch

474
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Enemy will see it

475
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
And will

476
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Absolutely

477
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Sing

478
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,856
You should not have any fear of Satan or his minions and his slaves

479
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,440
So Alex's

480
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Given the idea I guess

481
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Can you get magic

482
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Anti-corruption powers

483
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Which is

484
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Is good what is the Bible was just

485
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Old Testament in the letter to Thessalonians

486
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
What we're looking at right now

487
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,920
Jesus sucks man he's all like don't

488
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
It's strange

489
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,040
I don't know how much I believe necessarily

490
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
Magic antique Russian powers

491
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Whatever

492
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Alex Goes break

493
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Any comes back

494
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Going Whole Hog

495
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
Just Breathe

496
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
And he's just

497
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Now greetings

498
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,696
Rue

499
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,408
Because they are given over to strong delusion

500
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,296
The other doesn't sound like you

501
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
Saying unhealthy

502
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,048
Yep that's Gaslight exotic pretty hard

503
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,168
Reading scripture on air coming out of commercial breaks

504
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,264
Which is a great development

505
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
To use Magic anti-corruption Touch

506
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
A day and you only

507
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Have to rest one

508
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,992
2nd Timothy 1:7

509
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,600
Which is part of the letter that Paul was writing

510
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,976
Paul was in prison for Assurant

511
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,328
Don't worry about it

512
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,424
How do I get because it's fun here some other quotes from 2nd Timothy that Alex should think about

513
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
Recent more ungodliness

514
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,176
I can't think of a better description of The Three Little Pigs

515
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,504
Wednesday is Ben's trophy bowling

516
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,416
The servant of God but not strive but be gentle

517
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
Patient and weakness instructing those that oppose them

518
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Themselves

519
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
I can take a few things

520
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Describe Alex

521
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
Gentle unto all

522
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,032
In chapter 4 of 2nd Timothy Paul instructs Timothy to bring him his cloak

523
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,384
It talks about Alexander the coppersmith

524
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,760
Just talks about the coppersmith he doesn't like

525
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,112
I don't know anything about Alexander

526
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
Uniformly douchebag my question is largely

527
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
If Alex is so ready to cite this verse

528
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Why is he silent on the matter of Alexander the copper

529
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,704
That's a good question of the coppersmith

530
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Does coppersmith Jones

531
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
I'm a coppersmith truther

532
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
Portsmouth

533
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:48,736
I think he's in the bar in the pocket of yoga out

534
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Just been a Prelude to him trying to

535
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
To get his audience

536
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
To accept Jesus

537
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
And it's the realization that

538
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,376
You don't have to have all the answers your will not defeat

539
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
Show me what to do

540
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
It will all follow and you will

541
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,928
Experience and intensifying relationship

542
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
I'm not against people who are

543
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
I am not against

544
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
Christianity I am not against Christians

545
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Muslims

546
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Not against

547
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
Anybody of any faith

548
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm against

549
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
I do not think

550
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
The distance

551
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
I think this is

552
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
A guy

553
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Pivoting his Khan

554
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,808
I think what you're seeing here is somebody who's like all right

555
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
I'm not making money doing this anymore

556
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
The ship is falling apart

557
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,768
Even if I get sued out of my entire existence

558
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,864
How's it going to be

559
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
Play Lee worried about that

560
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
I'm so if

561
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
You know Alex recognizes

562
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,080
Even if I do completely self-destruct on that path

563
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
There may be a future for me and televangel

564
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh absolutely Baker go to prison

565
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:28,832
For defrosting people come back and now has a compound in the Ozark

566
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:34,464
It's still make tons of money doing this is a safe Refuge

567
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
For me

568
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Despite like

569
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
The answer

570
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Suffocation of it just even in the last

571
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Has been pretty severe

572
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
To declare myself in a leadership position

573
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
The first

574
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
F****** hour of his show being this bizarre

575
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Religious

576
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Like I don't feel like

577
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Anybody should

578
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
Feel ashamed of having religious

579
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Believe

580
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
Or anything like that

581
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
And it's not my business or interest on the

582
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
The podcast to be like

583
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,744
You're stupid if you believe in God

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
And their religious beliefs

585
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
I don't respect people using it as a weapon

586
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Against their audio

587
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Yeah and that's all I see

588
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
She going on here

589
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,264
It's not critiquing somebody who wants

590
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Someone to accept you

591
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
That's

592
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
Like I could be easy to get that twisted

593
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
And that is not what I'm respond

594
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm responding

595
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
True Religion be used

596
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,624
It is as far away from what it is

597
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Possibly

598
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
He's just

599
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
He's just like

600
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
I made all this money

601
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
If I become a cult leader

602
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,168
I can make the same amount of money and I don't have to work

603
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,288
Probably still do some of the

604
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Steamworks

605
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
His work is just yelling

606
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
He's technically still work

607
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,552
Bright no totally ends I think it's a smart move on his part I don't know if that's what he's doing

608
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
But it's the feeling

609
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
That you get from listening

610
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Feel like I don't know what

611
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
This has to do with the Democratic

612
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
I don't know

613
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
You're just

614
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Trying to get

615
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
People

616
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Your

617
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
Version of religion that

618
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Yeah

619
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Haha

620
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Pivot

621
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
To religiously

622
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Organization

623
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
Would he be able to

624
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Who created Twitter

625
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Count for that organization

626
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Probably not

627
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh yeah well I mean we learned the Tommy Robinson and Sargon of akkad when they tried to get

628
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Twitter accounts for their runs

629
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
4 Harlem

630
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,472
Right so I probably wouldn't be able to

631
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Rebrand

632
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
Comeback

633
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,896
Easy like a lot of

634
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
Just be done in a purely religious

635
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
Just contact

636
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Do you know they're just demon

637
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
There aren't they already are

638
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:13,184
All the time even hybrids

639
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Steve Quayle

640
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
He's been on Jim Bakker Show like you could just

641
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
I made it wouldn't be hard

642
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
Yeah closedown Infowars laylow for 6-month

643
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Become a religious

644
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
6 months

645
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
He does have the actual lawsuit

646
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,016
The trial

647
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,832
Get enough money to weather that storm

648
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
And then come back

649
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
In some form as

650
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Purely religious

651
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
And then any kind of like

652
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
Answering him become even more compelling

653
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
Skyblock

654
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
My religion or whatever

655
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
I think if he was like

656
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Legitimately

657
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Trying to just

658
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Say hey

659
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
I believe in Christianity

660
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
And I want as many people to

661
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
To know the joys

662
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
And the love that comes

663
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
From Christy

664
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
But the issue is

665
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
Trying to

666
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,648
Proselytizing

667
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
God and Jesus

668
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
He's also say

669
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Don't go to church

670
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
The Falls churches

671
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Them Shazam

672
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
Control

673
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Because you have the real why didn't you

674
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,616
I want to send you out to bring other people to them

675
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Flip it

676
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Control of that whole flock

677
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
People and lead them

678
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
Into a spider

679
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
That's how this works

680
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Most churches churches all these golf glitterbug churches out there

681
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
What exactly falls under that

682
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,496
Not specific enough it's probably any church you might go to

683
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,288
Absolutely

684
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
Did you go to what do you mean

685
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:14,528
Cuz it's a spider

686
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,416
What you're doing here is trying to get people into a specific

687
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Your extreme right-wing

688
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
Possibly

689
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
Christian identity leading religious belief

690
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
That's what you want people to

691
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,752
Subscribe to with a religious fervor as opposed to just being in

692
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Interested in

693
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
Bringing people to Jesus

694
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,872
Write the problem is f***** up

695
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
No matter what anybody else says about

696
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
Right

697
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
Assault leader at all stuff conflict with stuff

698
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,768
Spider trap spiders

699
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
So Alex.

700
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Monster

701
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Torture you

702
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
God wants you to marry

703
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Into

704
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Life

705
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Is creation

706
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
It's a

707
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Love affair

708
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Once

709
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
2

710
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Torture your soul

711
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Because it's

712
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Is a loser

713
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Another joke

714
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
God did create a new one

715
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
I can't stand

716
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Watch

717
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
Football

718
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,248
Universe Works

719
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,648
Freeway

720
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
That's what free will is about most of these people are Satanist

721
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
Because of things I had nothing to do with their free will

722
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
So I don't

723
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:12,800
I don't know if you don't know what f****** contradiction how he's able to get around that is mine somehow

724
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Being obsessed with Free Will and then

725
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
Maligning people because of

726
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,736
Being the victims of crimes or their genetic makeup

727
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
F****** stupid

728
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
This is all incredibly dumb and

729
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
Kind of transparent on a certain level like

730
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,024
I don't know if he's going to pull the trigger and actually go through with any of those things that were talking

731
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
About like

732
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,120
Whatever

733
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
If you were to do it this is how you would start it

734
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
This is the kind of

735
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
Behavior you would expect from somebody

736
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Who wants to make that pitch

737
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Dial

738
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm not predicting

739
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
King shitt cuz Alex is a crazy for

740
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,648
A good that prediction could it be entirely bad and maybe he's just in a weird mood and felt like preaching today

741
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Yeah

742
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,536
You know couple days ago you wanted to l

743
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,120
Volume declared himself a leader then a couple days later this

744
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
Popping up on the show it just it just

745
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Field

746
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,544
Messed up all the way

747
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
But if I remember my Bible

748
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Seems like

749
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,712
God made it clear on multiple occasions

750
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
It was blasphemous

751
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
To tell him what his

752
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Reasons for doing

753
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
Or even try and tell other people

754
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
Why God does whatever he

755
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
And apparently Alex

756
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Is a direct line

757
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
To here's why God does

758
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
You think you think

759
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
I would say it is

760
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,544
It would literally be remind me of taking the lord's name in vain

761
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,151
Another thing that I think is really funny is that

762
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,759
Yeah was from seconds

763
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
I'll ask him

764
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
If you wants to declare himself a religion

765
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Just l

766
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
I think you should read 1st Timothy also

767
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
Because in 1st Timothy

768
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
38 discusses the

769
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
The requirements

770
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,703
Someone who will be uprooted considered to be a bishop

771
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
From 3:2

772
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
Must be above reproach

773
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Married only once

774
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,735
Temperate

775
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,831
Not quarrelsome and not a lover of money

776
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
Those are qualifications

777
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,887
It's almost it's almost impressive how all of those do not drive him

778
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Bishop

779
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,727
Hilarious

780
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,359
1st Timothy Timothy Mathers

781
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Great

782
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Go talk to Alexander the coppersmith

783
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Right the wrongs of Paul

784
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
So anyway

785
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,367
Commercial with that sort of

786
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
And here's how it comes back from come

787
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
He's hit show

788
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Episode

789
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,687
It's a special report

790
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
No

791
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
I don't know what

792
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
Just airplane

793
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
That requires that

794
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
Go from

795
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
Weird religious Tran

796
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:53,983
Into special report about how there's a TV show about awesome

797
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Hit the ground running when it first started by premiered its first

798
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
17 million viewers early on

799
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
But that did not last

800
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,087
According to the Olsen season 2 of the show which started in September 20th

801
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Ended in March 20th

802
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
18th

803
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
The show average

804
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
6.7

805
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
131 million viewers

806
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
And was never higher than seven points

807
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
7

808
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
Fractured

809
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
Season 3 which is currently airing

810
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
The further drop-in rate

811
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
6 million viewers for the

812
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
Four episodes are

813
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,735
The reason Alex is citing the the higher number is that

814
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,807
Numbers at least 2 years old

815
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,159
And the reason he's doing that is because it's you know the idea that the show with that many

816
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Alex

817
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Elevate

818
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
His stature

819
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Pure and simple

820
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
It's less impressive

821
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,471
To say that a side character was a parody If you want to show that would be easily in the ratings by The Voice

822
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
With the Stars

823
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
But that would be more accurate

824
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,127
Also I would be remiss not to point out how this special report gave me whiplash

825
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,199
Alex spent the first hour of his show basically this

826
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
Disturbing religious Tran

827
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,319
Then he goes to commercial the show returns to show

828
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
The super high ratings

829
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
It shows disjointed as hell

830
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,279
Like I don't know how whoever's working the board come up with something it wouldn't appear to be

831
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Largely contradictory of the

832
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,911
Selflessness and that the religious

833
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,959
Tone of the first part of the show

834
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Hugo going straight in

835
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
Into I don't know

836
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
It's just

837
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,663
Hugo s***

838
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
With the Stars loser

839
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
Sean Spicer

840
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,855
So Alex comes

841
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Or something like that

842
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,207
Just wasn't ready more about this

843
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,327
These characters are based on

844
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,335
Movies

845
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,839
Can create this false

846
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:34,495
I regret to inform you we did this new site

847
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:40,895
Go back when there's a character that was similar to Alex on homeland

848
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
Globus could kill a man

849
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,527
If there are actually doesn't

850
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
The characters based on Alex and movies and documentaries

851
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Explanation been there all day

852
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Based on Alex

853
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
A possible explanation being that there are way more people walking around in public who sound like Alex.

854
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
There used to be

855
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
Characters on the show involves relatability

856
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,799
It seems like there's more people know somebody who's a bit like Alex

857
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,103
Is there more characters on shows like this

858
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
It's less likely that Alex is super

859
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
Popular and relevant

860
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,247
It's more likely that this stupidity

861
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
Champion

862
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Is become more Main

863
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,183
People could be getting the same sort of bulshit from Fox News

864
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,999
As opposed to usually being

865
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:33,631
Those folks would be ashamed the level of

866
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
Rank overt stupidity of bigotry

867
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,591
They use the code things a lot better

868
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
Tiny little

869
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Puzzle piece away

870
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Tucker Carlson

871
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
I'm just saying like

872
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
White people are the best let's kill everybody else

873
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,343
We all know that the Bible is

874
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,207
Ancient American scripture we're not far not far

875
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,559
This complaining about the media demonizing him is just sort of a diversion

876
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
Sidetrack for Alex

877
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,143
He gets back to religious

878
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
Is

879
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:17,663
And then tell you you got to go through them to get to the metaphysical that you knows

880
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,903
The disinformation and craziness comes from

881
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Within

882
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
Generations

883
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
5

884
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,447
Two horned devil.

885
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
Where was the ancient world they found the pyramids

886
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,431
They're finding pyramids in China

887
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
Whatever

888
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,815
I guess I can't look into it then

889
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
The black pyramids in

890
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,703
I'm almost there

891
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,287
I'm almost certain he's just talking about that

892
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,335
So whatever

893
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,943
Los Angeles

894
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,087
Libertarian

895
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,927
None of them live around there and they can't stand

896
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,279
What is 1 B

897
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
Blood

898
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Everything

899
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Sure

900
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,711
Most people get really scared

901
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
Decide to serve it

902
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
Wouldn't that be those Libertarians that you're talking about

903
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,231
And if they decided to service

904
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:20,031
These people are bigger than Charlie Sheen major Stars

905
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
People who are like 8

906
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
Okay well crew would have to

907
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,063
About vampires

908
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:38,207
Just b******* if you've ever read the graphic novel American vampire

909
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,511
It's very good and it just opens in the 19

910
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
1820s with

911
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,583
Vampires running Hollywood

912
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:50,751
This also suspiciously like the s*** Charlie Sheen probably tell Alex in the middle one of his Coke binges

913
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,543
Yeah

914
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,431
There's demons everywhere they've taken over

915
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,735
All this s***

916
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,783
Defeat them very either by believing

917
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
Has God not destroy.

918
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
If demons are taking over there running amok

919
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,071
Is God not destroyed us like Noah I want to know the answer

920
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Is because God

921
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
Loves our ancestors that prayed for us

922
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Becoming

923
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
Quietly

924
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
The future

925
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
So God is only not destroying up cuz we have a built a bank of prayers because our answer

926
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
Preyed upon

927
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,383
No one pays into it

928
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:05,759
It won't run out as long as we all need to pray like

929
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,063
Crazy

930
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Great

931
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
I don't know what to say to that

932
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,119
We're not being destroyed because our ancestors prayed enough

933
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
Very very weird

934
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
I want a number

935
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
I want a number what

936
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:33,151
The correct amount of prayer if you have a situation where there's a no

937
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,687
Enough prayer coming from your Aunt

938
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
That means there was a

939
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:43,391
Point where enough prayer like right over under for how many prayers you need it also implies

940
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,791
It also implies on some level that there is a need God has for prayers

941
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,375
Why would there be a line

942
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Very weird

943
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
He's actually talking about ayahuasca

944
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,175
A bit about DMT and how if you take it yours

945
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,855
Because the only thing that's going to contact you

946
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
I'm taking it

947
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,039
50 years

948
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
How's that 45-minute trip

949
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Dementia

950
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
I guess 5 minutes I probably is.

951
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
Outfitters alternative explanation

952
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
It's completely possible for a bad time

953
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
Really has nothing to do with literal demon

954
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:11,199
From everything I've read or heard about the experience taking p.m. to your Ayahuasca puts a person into a state where

955
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
Struggling

956
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
Conscious level of baby trying to ignore

957
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Become very

958
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Clear to them

959
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,903
A friend who taking it said it was a challenging experience with Air Force 2

960
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,695
Confronting work through a lot of stuff that they've

961
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Been suppressing

962
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,279
I want friend who's a super happy-go-lucky type

963
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,839
The person who took it said it was just really interesting

964
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
Make a good hallucination

965
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Kind of Xperia

966
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
The point is a lot of what you experienced in those States depends on what you bring to

967
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
To the table

968
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,359
It's certainly not the case for all Christians but I would guess a lot of a sort of Christy

969
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,943
Listen to Alex's associated with b b a particular sort of Christian

970
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,015
Put on the fire and brimstone

971
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:50,367
They might be the sort of post-tribulation rapture

972
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
They might be the sword we're stuck in the part of Chris

973
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,487
Belief that emphasizes that humans are deficient fine

974
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,327
Take me to certain beliefs into hallucinogenic experience

975
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
Is Austin going to be bad

976
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
Experience these beliefs don't really stand up to scrutiny

977
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,775
They all that well

978
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
Your beliefs

979
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,943
It's about this stuff yeah that's no good I don't want to take DMT and then start reading sinners in the hands

980
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,319
To give you a bad trip all

981
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,647
Security about the idea that all loving God would create exist

982
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
The cruelty

983
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:30,559
Your subconscious will do the rest any kind of feelings that you've been sick

984
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
Depressing about your beliefs

985
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
You'll be confronted with

986
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Fight it

987
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
Like I know from taking acid in mushrooms

988
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,775
In the past

989
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Blue whale

990
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
One of the way

991
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,639
That you can end up having a very bad time

992
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
Is by

993
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Fighting

994
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:51,551
Thoughts

995
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
You'll end up like a trapped in

996
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Weird

997
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,231
Conflict with yourself

998
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
You can go on

999
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,631
Anybody who works for Alex

1000
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Would not be able to handle being

1001
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Confronted

1002
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
With subconscious

1003
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Things that they

1004
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:16,639
If you work for Alex you know on some level that you work for a liar

1005
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,967
Taking a hallucinogen would be at nightmare

1006
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
They always empty

1007
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,439
Exercise having a guy

1008
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
Anytime you go on any of those strips

1009
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,767
You want a guy there too

1010
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Comfort you in

1011
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,607
Keep you on the path instead of getting lost

1012
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
And you don't want

1013
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,495
I'm sure they did

1014
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,127
Around Alex

1015
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,175
Oh God he would turn into a demon

1016
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
So fast

1017
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
To be said for like

1018
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
Christians being particularly tormented by

1019
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,207
Did sorta Kristen's that Alex probably hangs out with probably have a lot of unresolved

1020
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,255
Stuff they need to work through

1021
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
Brought up

1022
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
The state of Illusion

1023
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Magenic trip

1024
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,119
And experience that as demon

1025
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
Torturing them for their beliefs

1026
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Call bunch of bulshit

1027
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,007
But Alex has one other citation

1028
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
And it's a guy that I

1029
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Play this again

1030
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Eric Muller

1031
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,319
Joshua

1032
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Costa Rica

1033
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
$50,000

1034
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,655
All saw the same aliens come out of the forest

1035
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
Just were there to help

1036
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
Tell folks it was feeding time

1037
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
Mankind

1038
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
Duck-fat on

1039
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
And here's a few

1040
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:06,719
Reasons why first involvement Kouts 02

1041
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,279
Got paid $15,000 for an Ayahuasca retreat

1042
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Costa Rica

1043
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
There's a group called soltara that offers

1044
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:16,191
Most expensive package

1045
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
Is just under $7,000

1046
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,519
And that's for two people

1047
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
You could stay in a private couples

1048
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,127
Covers all the costs for the week that you're there

1049
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,431
Food everything

1050
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,759
Kind of affordable

1051
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
Not at all.

1052
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:38,207
Doc.

1053
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,047
There's would be able to

1054
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
$2,000

1055
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,375
3 week Retreat for

1056
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
Two people

1057
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:52,543
At Vicente pretty like Resort

1058
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
High-end

1059
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,407
Right I wanted to know more so I went to listen to an episode of podcast

1060
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
To the guy who runs the return

1061
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,271
He went to a place called rhythmia

1062
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
If you look it up it cost

1063
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
$300 a day

1064
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,951
Have to been there for 50 days for $15,000

1065
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
Jesus was only in the desert

1066
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,559
440 manman count

1067
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
Is there for a week

1068
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
So it's like

1069
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:22,239
Which is pretty standard for people who go and do non-luxury

1070
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,519
Trips like this

1071
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:29,919
The entire episode of Mancow show is about how Ayahuasca is a medicine that helps people overcome trauma

1072
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
And reconnect with themselves

1073
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,503
There's no conversation about everybody scene

1074
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,063
Aliens there's no demon possession

1075
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
Talks about recovering memory from

1076
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Beautiful

1077
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:45,023
He asked me about the guy the Clockwork elves

1078
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,583
Advance Auto explicitly says quote

1079
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
See any of the

1080
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,143
It's all bulshit

1081
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,239
Listen to podcast with this guy it's one of the more

1082
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,799
Like I was

1083
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
Because he wasn't

1084
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
Being

1085
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,759
It's very unlike the experiences that I've personally

1086
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,855
I've heard him

1087
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,927
Was having a really really hard time and needed to go to this

1088
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,999
Retreat at exactly if it was like

1089
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
A friend of his went

1090
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:22,911
Before and that's why they went together

1091
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,447
Experian

1092
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
And the guy who's on his

1093
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Just talking about it in the

1094
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
The context of

1095
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
Are you go

1096
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359
You're shown

1097
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
Important moments

1098
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,943
In your memories and your path

1099
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Places where part

1100
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,807
Of you became alienated from yourself

1101
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
Offers you the opportunity

1102
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
To confront those things

1103
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
From your past

1104
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
And move past

1105
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,535
It's shockingly

1106
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,863
I don't even know what the right word is but just

1107
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,703
Find Flamenco episode

1108
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,031
There is Easter

1109
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
There's even a conversation

1110
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,687
Between him and this dude and runs the resort talking about the difference in belief of like

1111
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,759
Whether it's a mystical thing or chemical thing

1112
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,831
I don't really care if you believe

1113
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
If if you believe that if

1114
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
The chemical thing

1115
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:19,999
Then that's your experience and that's great that's awesome if you have a chemical Experian

1116
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
Allows you

1117
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:25,375
The same benefit as somebody else who believes it's a mystical experience

1118
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
What's the reason we should argue about

1119
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
There's no Orthodoxy

1120
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
There's no

1121
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
There's no aliens

1122
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,663
You would think there's no Keebler aliens

1123
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,967
Medicare does a half-hour episode talking

1124
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Guy runs the retreat

1125
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,879
Everyone's are salt the same alien and got taken over by

1126
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:55,839
And I don't think I was the kind of person to shy away from that out of politeness

1127
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,751
This m*********** made me see alien and I got

1128
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Right

1129
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,895
If I do Mancow repertoire

1130
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,735
The only thing this evening

1131
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Close

1132
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,319
Is that the guy who's on the podcast

1133
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
With me

1134
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,135
How does mention that you had

1135
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Experiences taking

1136
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Ayahuasca

1137
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,975
Where he and somebody else

1138
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
I quit taking it

1139
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
Had a shared

1140
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Experience

1141
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,351
Is

1142
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Subjective

1143
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,935
So even if it is both of their subject

1144
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
I don't know

1145
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,775
I don't know if that's real

1146
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,127
I don't I don't know I but I also believe that if there's a possibility that

1147
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,663
Could be maybe

1148
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:49,343
You hear similar stories when people about like meditation and lucid dreaming

1149
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
You hear that

1150
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Shared

1151
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Subconscious

1152
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Experience

1153
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
In other avenues

1154
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,303
I think that that's something

1155
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
People we might learn more about as we

1156
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
Get a greater understanding of how our brains

1157
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,215
I think

1158
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,263
Part of that like

1159
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
I don't care if you think

1160
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
Chemical or mystical

1161
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
That's cool

1162
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,175
Did you hurt yourself did you hurt somebody else

1163
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
No you only benefited

1164
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,271
Well then find the subjective experience

1165
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:23,135
Far as it goes

1166
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
About

1167
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,719
Aliens

1168
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,327
That's why they aren't

1169
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,447
Open pallets

1170
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,775
And if that's the case then Alex you think Mancow is evil

1171
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:44,639
Because the functions that podcast just to get more food for the alien

1172
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,431
Or whatever the demon

1173
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,247
So would be an active promoter of

1174
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,807
Feeding time so

1175
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,367
Mexico

1176
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,719
And I think Alex

1177
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,023
Just making s*** up knowing the bank how is going

1178
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
I agree

1179
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
It gets back to talk about

1180
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,703
Germany has been transitioned

1181
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
2

1182
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
The news of the day it's a little jarring

1183
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,615
Questionnaire with our memories light

1184
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
Send a text

1185
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
Oh no

1186
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Autograph

1187
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,855
Computer memory

1188
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
Tulsi gabbard

1189
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Anti

1190
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
In which war

1191
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
This is too much

1192
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,175
Timer a long pause

1193
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Romance

1194
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
Maverick

1195
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Chose

1196
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:01,183
Sparse beard

1197
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,975
Really

1198
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,535
Get into the debates though and he doesn't

1199
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,303
At this point

1200
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
Really at all except

1201
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,471
Endless war thing but I think

1202
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
Did she is just there in order to take

1203
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Takeout Trump

1204
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:22,943
She's the Dark Horse or whatever I don't know I don't know what he's doing

1205
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
Little bit

1206
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
Cuz he's got to get back

1207
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
The talking about the good doctor

1208
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,855
And how they're making fun of him

1209
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:46,495
Turns out he works for the Nations

1210
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,479
Funds a lot of the shows on ABC really

1211
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
Dreadlocks

1212
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
I will be in a shareholder document

1213
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,135
That's the first entry is Bill Gates

1214
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Research

1215
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Don't be digging on this and by that I mean he's gone to Gordon's Wikipedia

1216
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
Redirected videos for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1217
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Do you want

1218
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,567
If we're going to play this game let's at least make it fun

1219
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:26,943
Seth Gordon also directed the king of Kong that documentary about the Donkey Kong world record

1220
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,295
Conspiracy

1221
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:36,415
Donkey Kong Gaga

1222
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:42,815
There you go there's no citation on his what work he did with the Gates Foundation

1223
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
I guess it has to do with the six months

1224
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
She spent teaching in

1225
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
According to an article about him and Reuters promoting his upcoming film

1226
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,103
Should I quote after discovering the Canyon in

1227
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Infrastructure leaves

1228
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,407
School building to the locals

1229
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,271
He helped get philanthropic you and financing to finish up a rose

1230
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
And then film to students

1231
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Residences be experience

1232
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
The ensuing

1233
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Change it

1234
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,183
His work was abused work

1235
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,743
Towards a documentary called building Shimon yarrow

1236
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,815
This is where the path intersects with the gates

1237
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Do you want

1238
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,703
Either that or Bill Gates movie starring Gordon

1239
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Also Direct

1240
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,543
Everybody knows only Satan believes in more than one Christmas

1241
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:30,687
Any evidence needed has Alex that he works for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the UN

1242
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
But

1243
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
Just passed Pat probably enter

1244
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Intersected with

1245
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
There

1246
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
The Development Council

1247
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
Might get involved with

1248
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,439
While he was trying to help build schools and Kenny

1249
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Years ago

1250
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,255
Is it like

1251
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,863
What right

1252
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,935
You know another problem with income inequality

1253
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,263
Is there a never-ending amount of billionaires

1254
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,311
Is to update your b*******

1255
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Conspiracy theory

1256
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,407
Like you start with the Rothschild or whatever

1257
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,967
Avanti

1258
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Name of

1259
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:12,671
And then you wind up with Soros and then you go to Gates and then it's never ending

1260
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
Blame the government

1261
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
He won't have

1262
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
That might not be a great

1263
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
Development for his rhetoric

1264
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
I don't know

1265
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
Right don't care it's just like

1266
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,639
This is the same thing as saying the good doctor has 1718 million viewers

1267
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Who's making

1268
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
The attack on you

1269
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:40,319
This guy to direct a video about

1270
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,135
The Gates Foundation when he was trying to help

1271
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,463
Smoke Canyon School get built which was in

1272
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,999
Intersected with a wrench

1273
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,839
He doesn't work for them

1274
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,679
It's just crazy it's the only ate all it does

1275
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,519
Is it serve to make it look like on me

1276
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,311
Hey look at how powerful the peace

1277
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
People are who are reality

1278
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,223
It's probably just like hey here's something we could put into an episode

1279
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,551
There's an archetype that's Goofy and ripe for parody

1280
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Yeah not hard

1281
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,343
Nope

1282
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,391
You're not hard

1283
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
It's not hard

1284
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:20,767
To book don't guest on your show and Alex has done just that

1285
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
Carl Benjamin Sargon of akkad is back in studio whether she is a Smart Cookie look forward

1286
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,591
What do you want to cover first

1287
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
So Carla

1288
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,991
What is a first date

1289
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,271
Navigate to that Unabomber

1290
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
Alex

1291
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Behavior

1292
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Which is

1293
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,983
Have already left

1294
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,735
And the

1295
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
Putting the baby to bed

1296
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
Ending the war the Deep State started

1297
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
I don't know

1298
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
1

1299
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
Support

1300
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
Blank is a few

1301
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
All roads

1302
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,615
I guess so

1303
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
Sargon has

1304
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
Is a little bit of an interest

1305
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
Sing take on this

1306
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Carl

1307
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:52,927
Carl has an interesting take on this

1308
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,207
You're taking the troops out

1309
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
You know

1310
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,815
And Carl realizes that well I mean they also sent troops

1311
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,839
What's the Saudi Arabia

1312
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
Which is true

1313
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,423
Now Mike down for this

1314
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
How this exchange goes

1315
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,055
Because I think is one of the most revealing

1316
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,127
Clips that we maybe have ever played

1317
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,943
What do you make of what you just saw cops

1318
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
Trump is doing what he said he would

1319
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,087
2016

1320
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,999
Living Desert

1321
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
In the middle

1322
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:33,375
People essay well he sending xmod troops to Saudi Arabia

1323
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Igtools

1324
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:44,895
One of those things where it's a homogeneous

1325
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,479
Yeah yeah

1326
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
So

1327
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
First of all

1328
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:57,183
Arabia is our Ally so Trump has to send troops to support them over there

1329
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:02,815
There are more real than Saudi Arabia

1330
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,375
That argument for his evolved 11

1331
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,983
Fall completely apart upon any examination

1332
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,031
Strike one Carl

1333
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:18,431
Carlos

1334
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:28,927
Now ignore for a minute that Alex was convinced recently by Joel skousen that Trump taking troops out of Northern Syria with

1335
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,023
Because this goddamn show exist

1336
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
Outside of context

1337
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Obviously

1338
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
Intentionally ignored

1339
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Trump sending troops to

1340
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
Saudi Arabia

1341
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,543
From everything I've listened to visit just pretending it didn't happen

1342
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,103
Because he knows he can't justify it at all

1343
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,407
That's why would Carl brings it up

1344
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:54,271
Alex first tries to pretend that what's really happening is a trump is better than missile defense system

1345
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:58,623
But Carl doesn't realize that this is not a welcome talking point on Alex's

1346
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,927
So he tries to correct Alex

1347
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,559
Compromise

1348
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,679
Namely the only a couple to man the missile defense system

1349
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:17,311
You see how that works there that back and forth is so revealing

1350
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:21,663
That's all he's doing is AAA

1351
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,735
An uncontrolled variable entering Alex's

1352
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
Controlled

1353
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,319
And then you see how it's mitigated

1354
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
You see it

1355
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,391
Leave the conversation that's happening

1356
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
Is very clear the message that Alex is because stop it

1357
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Stop

1358
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
MMA

1359
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,071
Knows well enough to be like oh yeah okay

1360
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,143
You can tell there's pushback on this

1361
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:48,799
Is very real thing as it all why would anybody push back on that do it kind of hurt a scenario

1362
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,127
Alex is lying because he can't afford to tell the truth

1363
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,967
The missile defense systems were sent last month along with a couple hundred true

1364
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
Saudi Arabia

1365
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,343
And that was a response to the attack on Saudi oil interests the drop is blamed on a run

1366
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,695
In October on October 11th the New York Times reported the Trump is sending a proxy

1367
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
Smiley three thousand additional troops

1368
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
Which were not just people to man The Myth

1369
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
Defense system

1370
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,143
Alex is so full of s*** that clip is very special

1371
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
Because it demonstrates Malik

1372
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:23,103
Carl has no idea what things from The Real World are okay to talk about on Infowars and with her.

1373
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,991
Intentionally protects his audience

1374
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,087
From some information about reality that might lead them to realizing that he's misleading

1375
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,743
So Carl thinks that he can just speak freely cuz I was healed by free speech

1376
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,071
Create a new reality to explain away the verboten information

1377
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
It's just been introduced

1378
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,959
Without putting that stuff never come up

1379
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,239
The goalposts are on ice

1380
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,543
But please

1381
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:57,919
Come on man we outside

1382
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
He talks about

1383
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,223
Like he knows that

1384
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,783
More troops of exam Saudi Arabia

1385
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,575
And you just pretend

1386
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,183
Talking about this

1387
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,767
The situation

1388
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
Troops out I thought they were into leaving the middle

1389
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,191
Middle East

1390
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,519
To hear them screaming about how we should say that

1391
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Is

1392
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
An amazing

1393
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Is

1394
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:39,135
We have the moral Monday to impose allegations of Human Rights

1395
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,207
At least

1396
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,255
With what we consider to be

1397
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,535
Human rights

1398
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,143
A really interesting perspective the car all this putting forth

1399
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:56,543
The idea that people in the Middle East don't see much of an interest or at least the rest of the world

1400
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
Who don't have as much

1401
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,455
Right

1402
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,503
What we would call the people

1403
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:09,599
They're really into it and they're against

1404
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,879
Gas by there only

1405
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:23,935
I suppose he could be talking about the number of poles that have been done to show a trend in countries in the region of not believing in equality

1406
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:28,031
For women you can see things like that is unsalvageable difference

1407
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,895
Or you could realize that the polling numbers would look really similar if you did them in the US and then

1408
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
1950s

1409
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,967
A lot of history seems unfounded

1410
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
Cultural hatred towards Muslim

1411
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,343
I really don't see any other way to look

1412
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,415
Cuz I kind of get the sense that we're Carla's doing is just a

1413
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,207
Assuming that the terrorists and extremists

1414
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,023
Are completely representative of the people of the region

1415
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
And it does not seem

1416
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Fair

1417
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,863
It seems like this is based on feeling

1418
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:53,887
Also

1419
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Also

1420
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,423
Also

1421
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
F***

1422
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
You Carl

1423
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Carl

1424
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
Are not defined differently

1425
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,479
Earlier this year Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Elsa

1426
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,039
Formation of a commission on unalienable rights

1427
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,111
Would you said would revisit the most basic of questions

1428
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,951
What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right

1429
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:23,839
He went on to say quote How can there be human rights we possess not improve alleges we're granted or even earn but

1430
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,399
Virtue of our Humanity belong to us

1431
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,983
Is it true as our Declaration of Independence assert

1432
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
All of us every member of our human family are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable

1433
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
What the f****** monster

1434
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,855
Is this a state department or an undergrad philosophy class

1435
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
If you hear someone in Trump's cabinet floating questions about whether or not people have rights just because they're people

1436
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,863
You better prepare yourself for the answer they come up with to be maybe not or worse

1437
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:01,215
I found it when people insist on asking long ago answer question

1438
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,823
Already came to

1439
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:09,407
A commission like this does not exist to strengthen or celebrate human rights

1440
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:12,223
It exists after completely different question

1441
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
But High

1442
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,319
What can we get away with

1443
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,111
Yep it doesn't make things look

1444
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
You better when you learn

1445
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,927
Glad I protested the

1446
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,743
The commission haven't found over anti-lgbt

1447
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:28,095
Statements made by seven of the nine members appointed to the commission

1448
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,167
And there are a whole ton of anti woman's right to choose

1449
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
In there too

1450
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,495
That's what this is about

1451
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Jesus Christ

1452
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,823
My point is I guess

1453
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,407
Is human rights issues all over the place

1454
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:46,271
I don't know what Carl was talking about what he says the Middle East isn't into human rights like we are

1455
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,063
And since he doesn't give me any citation

1456
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Chance to go on it

1457
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
I just have to assume

1458
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
Feels that way

1459
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,183
And doesn't care about other ants

1460
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Human rights issue

1461
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
Around the world

1462
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
You know what I

1463
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Very funny

1464
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,607
Where is Elmo state

1465
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
Suspicious

1466
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,471
Just parallel between

1467
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,519
In the seventies and eighties

1468
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,823
Russia-us right

1469
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Because Iran

1470
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,247
There was a far more open and a galuteria society and then we helped install a repressive

1471
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
F****** Theocratic nightmarish

1472
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
Regime

1473
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
And Russia is

1474
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
Basically

1475
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
Did the same thing.

1476
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
It's very fast

1477
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:32,095
A book about it okay

1478
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
So

1479
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
Sargon of akkad

1480
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
AKA Carl

1481
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
I is

1482
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,311
He's up on things he knows about

1483
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:46,687
Struck me as weird and why people are talking about him

1484
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,527
I'm not even sure what the grounds for impeachment

1485
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
What are they even saying that should be

1486
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,679
Buddy reads his divorce files it's really amazing

1487
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
10-4 it's also

1488
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,112
Shane Boldin there's so many better ways to attack you

1489
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,696
Also mustache

1490
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,512
For the longest time

1491
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,144
Hadn't revealed his music

1492
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,544
The only picture Alex had of him was from the 70s

1493
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,872
It was a pretty big bust at SoDo

1494
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
Maybe he's onto something

1495
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456
Didn't like

1496
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Until blue blue

1497
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
Wasn't a big fan of

1498
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,320
So Alex

1499
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,136
This is all about

1500
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
Warriors and

1501
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
He's doing all this

1502
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
Great

1503
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,584
It's so annoying

1504
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
Like

1505
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
Because it's

1506
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
So start

1507
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,240
They have to go so far in the

1508
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,312
Like if it was just a little bit of that

1509
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,152
It is just a little bit of that phone call and there was no other information

1510
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,224
They can be like oh well you're all blowing it out of

1511
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
Proportion

1512
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
Democrat Lisa

1513
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
Knowledge that it

1514
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,112
Because it's so obvious out criminal

1515
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
They're just like

1516
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:38,048
Never heard

1517
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
Like it's just

1518
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,864
So hard today

1519
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
To the delusion

1520
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
SMS

1521
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,776
About the debate and Alex

1522
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
Who's kind of Pro Tulsa

1523
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
Which is weird

1524
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Considering

1525
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,688
By his own definition

1526
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,968
She's a gun grabber

1527
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,040
Which literally

1528
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:05,440
Anybody who indicate in favor of red flag laws

1529
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,536
Everybody anyway

1530
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,584
That they're interested in guns being

1531
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,608
You take it and or

1532
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,888
Restricted

1533
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,424
Weird

1534
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
In this clip you speak

1535
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
About her positively

1536
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
But also brings up that

1537
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
She wants

1538
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
Grabbing

1539
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,176
Just blows away everybody else

1540
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:32,832
She said some terrible things I disagree with

1541
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
So I mean

1542
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Some good

1543
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
Everybody else

1544
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
Ever

1545
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,200
Who's in favor of red flag laws for gun regulation

1546
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
He's a f****** demon

1547
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,064
I don't get it

1548
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,624
I'd

1549
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,720
It's probably just because he thinks he's hot

1550
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Yeah

1551
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,680
But they're just shattered

1552
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,616
She's a dark horse they're holding

1553
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
Interesting thing that everybody's got to be kind of aware of

1554
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,800
And that is this world likes bird

1555
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Andrew yang

1556
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
Universal

1557
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,640
I don't know why

1558
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
WinCo

1559
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,456
But it's strange

1560
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,016
It's very strange

1561
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,320
Are the candidates that people Envy

1562
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
Extreme right-wing like Alex

1563
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,000
And people who are more

1564
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,816
I don't know what you call Carl

1565
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,864
Quite frankly just a s*** head

1566
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
Pieces of s*** head

1567
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,872
Kind of far right is Alex

1568
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,432
But he is certainly

1569
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
He certainly should

1570
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:39,040
Yeah they're all they're all on board

1571
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,320
Which

1572
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
Is weird AC same thing from Robert Barnes

1573
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Weirdly

1574
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,184
Why

1575
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,744
Don't know

1576
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Obviously

1577
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:54,144
So clip earlier when

1578
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,544
Alex and Carl were having a little bit of a negotiation about whether or not Trump is second to

1579
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,128
I was really illustrative

1580
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,528
Of how this works on Alex's show that you cannot counter his narrative

1581
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
Push like Alex get there

1582
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
And if you don't

1583
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
Fall in line

1584
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,928
It'll probably

1585
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,720
Interview

1586
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,304
The route of acquiescing to Alex

1587
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
The interview

1588
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,400
And now Alex pull the power move

1589
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,984
Where he makes Carl report on an article that he hasn't read

1590
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,304
2D platformer

1591
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,168
Dosing child sexual exploitation promotion cell phone

1592
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:06,080
How did works

1593
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,872
Reporter is a joke

1594
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
He already did that and the other band

1595
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
There is

1596
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,808
No reason to for Alex to say hey

1597
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:22,208
Carl why don't you report on this article that you haven't read you can hear the hesitancy in in Colorado

1598
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
This is from RTI

1599
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,048
I guess it's right I'll look stupid

1600
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:32,704
Right and then he's reading it and took what why would you have any issue with Twitter having rules where world leaders can

1601
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,496
Zack list of things

1602
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,336
Clear

1603
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,408
World leaders should not be able to do those things

1604
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
If your

1605
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
Open Lisa

1606
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,784
Most active

1607
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,064
They're banning

1608
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,672
Outright calling for violence against someone specifically right

1609
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:59,072
You're saying that Trump outright calls for violence against people specifically

1610
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
Which iPads

1611
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:10,848
Carl has allowed

1612
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,432
Alex decides to start speaking in a British accent

1613
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:20,320
I want Kamala Harris

1614
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,304
I'll show my friend

1615
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
Noticed

1616
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
My good man

1617
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:51,296
I would be terribly offensive

1618
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
This is bad riffing

1619
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,208
This is a disaster Carl's laughter is probably just like

1620
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:04,608
Slightly discomfort and laughing at like this is uncomfortable as s***

1621
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,704
Breath of Life

1622
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
I would be terrible at fencing

1623
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,592
That's not the actor somebody was like I like what's happening

1624
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,408
What a boot

1625
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
Bootlicker

1626
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
That is exactly how Starman

1627
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
Untreated wormtongue

1628
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
Glad you are a

1629
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
Little booty

1630
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
Licking

1631
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
You are nothing

1632
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,512
Have fun with that

1633
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,840
Car wants to talk kind of

1634
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
Right, Harris head

1635
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
It suggested the trumps

1636
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
To be kicked off Twitter

1637
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
And car wash

1638
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
Talk about that

1639
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
Alex

1640
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
Wants to

1641
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
Fill out his character real

1642
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,808
What

1643
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
Sam

1644
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,512
I think you have any coffee

1645
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,960
This is not good

1646
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,776
That's good stuff

1647
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:22,176
Universal healthcare that people there's a lot of people

1648
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,504
Because of inability to access appropriate care

1649
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,368
We should be living in a society where people are using crowdfunding in order to

1650
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
God dammit

1651
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,512
God damn it you are talking

1652
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,280
King to a child

1653
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
And it is so funny

1654
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,328
Exactly

1655
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,656
I didn't have to succumb to his whims

1656
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,472
Very poorly

1657
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,312
Clip of Kamala Harris

1658
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
And Alex has

1659
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Some criticisms

1660
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
Elizabeth Warren

1661
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:57,248
Sure over the video

1662
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
His info

1663
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
Kyle Brandt

1664
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,136
5 million Twitter

1665
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:20,288
We saw in El Paso

1666
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,640
So you know they're not supposed to

1667
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664
Children

1668
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:32,576
Development supposed to make it through pretty early

1669
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,880
Genius

1670
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
Against Elizabeth Warren

1671
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,208
By saying he's doing it because people say he shouldn't

1672
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,584
This is also what you expect to hear like from a rebellious teen trying to justify how they started

1673
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,704
Smoking not from an adult who spent the first hour of the show rambling about being on a mission from God

1674
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:55,616
It's all good

1675
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,944
Bryce shame the people in Alex's life for not recognizing warnings

1676
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
But yeah

1677
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,272
It's true that a lot of things

1678
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,832
A really troubling about what Alex is doing

1679
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
They could be elements of a performance

1680
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,952
But I would rather err on the side

1681
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,232
Taking Dysteria

1682
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,024
These symptoms that he's mad

1683
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:17,632
Indicates that he's putting on an act than all that happens is I look stupid for being

1684
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,936
Concerned about a con man putting on a show

1685
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
If you sincerely operating with this kind of diminished

1686
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Levels of

1687
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,544
Functioning

1688
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,360
It's only a matter of time before something goes horribly wrong

1689
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
I guess I hope I end up looking stupid

1690
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,968
Like I just like you can't

1691
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,504
You can't you can't

1692
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Be around this

1693
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,552
And not stop

1694
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
I just can't

1695
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
It's just pathetic not Lisa

1696
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,464
Even if we're talking about him putting on it

1697
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,256
This part

1698
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
Him talking

1699
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,816
Over Kamala Harris

1700
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
About

1701
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
Does Warren looking ugly

1702
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,960
Just because

1703
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,496
Fourth grade

1704
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:58,336
They're all in

1705
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,664
Into his friend while he's a f****** child

1706
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
It's something that you act

1707
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
That's just him

1708
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,856
And it's obviously intended to make people dying

1709
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:16,512
How to get negative attention from people from like

1710
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
The pyramids

1711
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,096
I'm sure that's what children do too

1712
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,656
They thrive on this negative attention it

1713
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
It's the pastoring again

1714
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,728
It's just

1715
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:30,080
He's operating on an adolescent level while at the same time

1716
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,360
Saying that God is

1717
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,664
Asking him to declare himself a leader

1718
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,688
Hey going on this

1719
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,712
Religious

1720
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
Quest

1721
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Open children

1722
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,112
It could be something to children do but it's also something

1723
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,416
Is very difficult

1724
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,440
Even adults

1725
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,512
To pull off response

1726
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:52,096
I just

1727
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,400
It isn't like it's going to probably get annoying

1728
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,960
It ain't our present-day episodes be given

1729
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
Little speeches

1730
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,848
It specifically directed to anybody who might working Infowars who's listening

1731
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Guys

1732
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Ladies

1733
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Call the.

1734
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,992
Someone can help him

1735
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,272
And they should

1736
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,344
Because this is not somebody who's well

1737
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,464
I feel like all those jobs are people riding this horse until it dies

1738
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,536
Like

1739
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:27,680
Dies

1740
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,752
I hope you do have you ever heard of

1741
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,544
I think you guys might

1742
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Find her

1743
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:41,248
So Carl and Alex are talking about social media

1744
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
Because of Sandy Hook

1745
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,576
And in this clip

1746
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
And Alex

1747
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
Straight up lies

1748
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,696
Carl's face

1749
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
About what he did

1750
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,608
I want to be clear

1751
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:01,728
I always thought I should make that video

1752
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,264
You know supposedly.

1753
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,384
What I said

1754
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:23,232
Shelly here

1755
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,704
Hurting family

1756
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:49,088
How to get the

1757
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:02,912
This is a complete bulshit wise Behavior

1758
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,008
So I mean this is just rank disrespect to it for his gas

1759
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:12,896
Which would be a perfectly acceptable out for him to

1760
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,480
Granted it might be tossed because it being sued right now

1761
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:21,088
Fight for him to say

1762
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
I did believe that I was wrong

1763
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:28,768
I was misled by a number of people who I believed to be credible sources at the time

1764
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,048
There's no shame

1765
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,328
Unless you're out

1766
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,632
He can't be wrong about anything

1767
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
Ever

1768
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,680
Enso

1769
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,728
It just makes allies

1770
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,520
Build on top of it

1771
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,288
Each other

1772
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,152
You just do not they're not having a real conversation

1773
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
Like Alex is just

1774
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
Insulting him Force

1775
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,296
Propaganda

1776
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,856
And then lying

1777
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,136
Disrespectful interview

1778
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,672
And I don't have any

1779
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,696
Care for Carl

1780
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
No

1781
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,536
For somebody who has a lawyer

1782
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,584
4 days a week

1783
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,680
Continuing would be my first

1784
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,472
First bit of advice

1785
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,752
To Alex's life

1786
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
Don't

1787
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
Don't say anything

1788
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,080
Stop you're not home

1789
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,640
You're not helping your case by creating a

1790
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
Completely fix

1791
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:21,248
No backstory for what you did

1792
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
Pretend that you

1793
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:26,880
F****** a behavior that could only hurt

1794
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,184
Because

1795
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,208
This isn't

1796
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
True

1797
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
Truths about

1798
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
Not true

1799
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:38,144
And the more he says it the more the audience has an opportunity to be like

1800
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:41,216
True lying about your coverage

1801
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:48,128
That introduces the guy that possibility maybe you're lying about everything else

1802
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
Feelings

1803
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,688
That is not why you were

1804
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,224
Hurt feeling

1805
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,504
Are not white

1806
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,368
What part of it.

1807
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:04,256
Play a video of a woman

1808
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
Oprah's

1809
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
Network I show on Oprah's network

1810
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
And Carl's there

1811
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
Alex is there

1812
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Italy and back

1813
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,544
Kid out visiting though

1814
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,176
This is Lady

1815
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
Music

1816
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,312
We really shouldn't

1817
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,592
Feel like that's all gone

1818
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:53,408
Now Alex is trying to

1819
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,432
Chris Carl

1820
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
Side of the the show

1821
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,928
Capri racist riffing about a video

1822
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,976
A blaze of a black woman discussing obese

1823
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Going to say that that

1824
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
We know

1825
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:16,448
The strawman version that they're attacking is that this woman in the video is blaming Trump for getting her fat

1826
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,752
Because they set this up as

1827
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:23,104
They've become free to goof on how stupid she is

1828
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,200
Super awesome riffs about racism is just an unhinged

1829
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:27,968
Crazy person

1830
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,272
Because they created the false argument

1831
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,600
And this is all the rage with media

1832
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:37,184
All the outlets have their own articles about this clip and they all have the same

1833
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,512
Gender studies professor says black women are fat because of

1834
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,560
In reality

1835
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:48,192
This is a clip of a woman named Brittany Cooper and she's discussing actual issues that Alex would rather

1836
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,472
Discuss fake versions of

1837
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:52,544
If you actually watch the Clipper read anything Cooper's put out

1838
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,688
You'll see that

1839
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,504
Insurance and worse Healthcare

1840
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,784
The issues that

1841
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
He is pointing to

1842
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:08,928
She also mentioned the theory that racism makes diets not work as well for black women

1843
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:11,744
Intercourse

1844
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
This is just

1845
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:16,352
The stupidest show nonsense that Alex and Karlov ever hurt

1846
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,656
But in reality there's some indication

1847
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,216
True maybe not racism

1848
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,008
Exactly but the experience of

1849
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
Dealing with races

1850
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:31,200
Cooper is specifically talking about research that has grown out of a paper

1851
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,224
American Medical women

1852
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:32,992
Association

1853
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,344
This paper was looking at the racial inequalities in women's health in the country

1854
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,416
By one of the focal points be excessive levels of

1855
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,232
The Chronic morbidity and disability are widespread among f

1856
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,768
Can American women regardless

1857
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,304
Who's socio-economic position

1858
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,864
Because the trend exists on larger

1859
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,984
Spectrum it's harder for them to check that up solely to having to do with access to healthcare or poverty

1860
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,544
Sunset across the socio-political economic

1861
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,312
Spectrum

1862
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,896
Does the author proposed a model called weathering

1863
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:05,248
Which African American women experience early Health deterioration

1864
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,880
Consequence of the cumulative impact of repeated experience of social economic and political exclusion

1865
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:15,232
This includes the physical cost of engaging actively to address societal

1866
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,536
Structural barriers to achievement

1867
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
Wellbeing

1868
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,144
It'll be really hard to defend early prove this

1869
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:26,240
But a number of peer-reviewed studies

1870
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,776
Suggested it might be on.

1871
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,568
This might be a model

1872
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,104
That explains things

1873
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,200
Much better than other models that you looked at

1874
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:40,576
Restrict poverty models for class model a strict model that looks like just a genetic

1875
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,624
Physician for things

1876
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,672
Seems like this works

1877
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,696
Better

1878
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,256
Explaining the phenomenon that we

1879
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,584
Easier to lose weight if you don't have the

1880
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,376
Russian gravity of

1881
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,656
Daily and dignity

1882
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,984
Weather

1883
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,776
It for everyone

1884
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,568
Super is arguing

1885
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,616
At Nueces articulating a day

1886
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,176
That's something about

1887
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,712
This experience that we

1888
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,480
We have

1889
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,528
It leads to

1890
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,856
Bodywork

1891
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,136
I'm so

1892
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:17,440
Things that would work normally

1893
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,744
Diet

1894
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Doesn't work

1895
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
Because of the metabolism

1896
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,560
Them changes

1897
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,096
That stress response

1898
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,424
I don't know if this is 100%

1899
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192
Proven

1900
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
But

1901
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,520
Peer-reviewed studies that have been done

1902
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
Have indicated that there might be some

1903
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,384
So I'm calling not to write this office

1904
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,152
Some kind of just

1905
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,944
Stupid b*******

1906
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,296
This might be it

1907
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,624
And I would imagine that of what also contributes to it is

1908
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,160
In the same way that women

1909
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Don't have

1910
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,976
Heart medication

1911
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
Conveyor

1912
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,584
Far less likely to work for women is because there

1913
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Tested on

1914
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:02,496
Like always said about

1915
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,264
Certainly Focus

1916
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
It's entirely upon

1917
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,848
So

1918
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,640
It's simply

1919
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
Something that people are

1920
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
Or studying is

1921
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
Is also very well be the case I'm not totally sure

1922
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:19,648
She specifically brought up at that did very well could be a factor

1923
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,256
I mean that could even be applied to weather

1924
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Sure

1925
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:31,680
The point here is that this woman is talk about something real that affects communities but Alex is not a part of and doesn't care about it all

1926
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:34,752
Instead of engaging with what she's actually saying and recognizing

1927
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,080
Specifically even

1928
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
Bubble and greatest

1929
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
2 attack

1930
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
Pretty racy

1931
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
So anyway

1932
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,880
I mean it's just it's just

1933
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
Believable

1934
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,464
Like

1935
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,256
The elements of it are like

1936
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,792
Real stupid

1937
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,352
You know creating a strawman to attack what she's blaming

1938
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
Trump for being fat

1939
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,400
Or something

1940
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Is stupid

1941
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:09,056
It's just all over right there's an article about it on the blaze

1942
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
Fox News

1943
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,128
It's just like this is a talking point

1944
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,176
This is like Alex's just doing like

1945
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
He might as well

1946
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,528
Riffing on stupid right-wing news

1947
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
It's just pathetic

1948
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
If it's sad because

1949
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
I need this

1950
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
To be clear

1951
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,584
The show opened with an hour of religious fervor right then now he has f****** Sargon of akkad in studio

1952
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,632
He's trying to impress him with racer

1953
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,960
Like that's what it needs on the same episode

1954
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
It's crazy

1955
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:39,776
So now

1956
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,544
Listen to this

1957
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,344
Stress-eating Issaquah

1958
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,864
Is what happened

1959
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,656
Racist

1960
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,472
Man it's really nice

1961
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
Of him to have

1962
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
Lee Ann McAdoo on

1963
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
In order

1964
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
To ignore

1965
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
That's really kind of him

1966
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:19,200
Better

1967
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
For the wrong

1968
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,784
Conclusion

1969
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,416
She would be able to actually cover this a little better

1970
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:40,192
It's like I have made you been to my well we're now in this place where I'm the alpha I have a dominant in the

1983
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,848
Because

Of course not.

1985
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,456

Commercial

1992
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:44,352
Clearly is it going

1993
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:47,936
Song right there

1994
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,496

Let's Play a clip of him being racist towards Chinese

1997
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:06,880
Great family show in Alex

1998
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:11,232
Broadcast hear sound

1999
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:14,560
Furious

2000
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:22,240
Broadcast

2001
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:34,528
This is our breaths just f****** so mad

2002
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,576
Yeah he is

2003
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,160
He is. She has work trying to broadcast

2004
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,512
I really think

2005
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:49,888
It's a strong indication that what I was saying might be the case screwed

2006
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:53,472
Maybe a lot of butter replacement

2007
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
Besides it's time to go to some calls

2008
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,128
Call and it also.

2009
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
Does not go well

2010
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,480
Warrior Princess

2011
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,296
In California

2012
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,952
It is amazing isn't it

2013
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,280
That's good

2014
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,096
Alright well she probably in like holding too long

2015
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:24,192
Oh my God sorry sorry

2016
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,240
Mute

2017
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,080
This is an arcade

2018
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,640
Age of the narcissist

2019
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,432
Gaslighting

2020
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:37,760
Was a rerun of the negging

2021
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,600
Taking aminu the baboon

2022
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:48,000
Throwing their boomerang

2023
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:54,400
Classic archetype

2024
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:58,496
That's all wrong

2025
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,056
Every part of that

2026
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:07,456
She's creating new racist things to say it might be I don't know enough to say what info Warrior Princess

2027
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,272
That's where she's coming from good

2028
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,296
I'm so

2029
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:15,136
Complaining about how Warren has no fashion

2030
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,720
Alex's response

2031
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,512
Is pretty normal

2032
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,304
Sweden

2033
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,584
Apathy

2034
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,936
Hillary up there with her mouth Mumu on Everett

2035
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,752
So we do see Warren with that black shirt

2036
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,592
45 years

2037
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:37,408
For girl and got no Style

2038
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:49,696
Scholars it keep talking about

2039
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,512
I was going to say once it once I heard them laugh I was like

2040
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,792
She's killing

2041
01:49:54,048 --> 01:50:00,192
She's going to get a shower she's getting a job old man house phone

2042
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,752
It's not real

2043
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:08,384
Actually got around to doing it which I don't think would be wise for him to

2044
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,408
To do giving

2045
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
His listeners actual

2046
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,736
Like authorship

2047
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,016
On the Shelf

2048
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,856
I think that he knows enough

2049
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,416
I mean

2050
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:25,792
He knows it's like some people might seem like they're right on and then they might say something about

2051
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:32,192
Is it dangerous

2052
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,264
Call there's too much freedom

2053
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,616
But if you're really smart thing for him to do if that weren't the case because their work for free

2054
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,664
Freak

2055
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,992
I think that's why

2056
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,016
Keeps thinking

2057
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
I got to do that

2058
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:51,392
Earlier Alex was doing a big butt wrist to

2059
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:53,184
Chinapress Carl

2060
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:58,560
Complaining about you know men demanding they be called ma'am

2061
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,912
Potshots at me

2062
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,984
Again just to impress Carlos Behavior SquarePants

2063
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:33,120
I have friends and I have a DE

2064
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:42,336
Yes ma'am

2065
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:55,904
That's a mean he said that multiple times you like that

2066
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,744
It almost reminds me of what

2067
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,888
Almost reminds me of like people at open mics the right a b i q

2068
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,216
Go to punch this up I know you're the king's yelling about sjw

2069
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
Please call

2070
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,408
It's I think it's just her being there

2071
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,992
The fact that he has not listened to her one time

2072
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,784
Is self-defense

2073
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:29,696
Eclipse that I'm not playing

2074
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:35,328
Accurately portray the field scholarship

2075
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
So f****** awesome

2076
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,376
Just

2077
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,424
Goliad

2078
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,728
Call people here

2079
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,544
Absurdly disrespect

2080
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,568
Both of them

2081
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,360
It's crazy

2082
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,408
I think you are

2083
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Leanne

2084
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:50,944
This

2085
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:57,344
Series of Clips is living proof white everything that you have said is wrong

2086
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,720
So h w Carl's validation

2087
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,280
Charles has an idea for what Alex

2088
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,560
You should do

2089
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:19,872
There's a clip playing underneath that they didn't set up in any way there's just weird audio playing under it

2090
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,664
I have no idea what it is I don't care

2091
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,248
You want this sort of thing is already be

2092
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
Been done

2093
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:30,112
Like his fellow internet propaganda Florence Southern already did this gender prank

2094
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,136
If you want to call it that

2095
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,952
Knows full well what the result is

2096
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:37,280
In 2016 Lauren did it start when she legally changed

2097
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,560
Your gender to male

2098
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,120
I guess is an attempt to demonstrate how easy it is to

2099
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:47,008
To get that change on your ID card in Canada

2100
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:50,080
Obviously this is just a temperature

2101
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:53,152
Community who cheap made a large part of her career victimizing

2102
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:53,920
That's all

2103
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:58,784
Have to do it most of the coverage it is I can find it doesn't seem like people took the bait

2104
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,184
A lot of responses that I found more focused on how sad this kind of stock was and how it demonstrates a fundamental disinterested

2105
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:11,072
Ultimately most people saw this for what it was

2106
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:15,424
Intended to make money off angry people who care about social justice

2107
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:22,080
Lauren works for Rebel media at the time and already had a career gone nose full of sad offensives.

2108
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:24,896
Anyone who knew what you was about knew what you was doing

2109
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:31,552
I saw some responses

2110
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,600
Question did the little by doctors day

2111
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,368
Consult

2112
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:38,464
Probably the best way to take a note 4 propaganda

2113
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:43,072
Stop and take the power away from them

2114
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,728
All in all it was a flop for Laura

2115
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
Group generation

2116
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:59,200
Intercept boats of refugees in the Mediterranean Sea

2117
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,600
Subservient

2118
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
Cracking up

2119
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:09,696
People quitting political stuff into 20

2120
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,376
Get the

2121
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,424
Response the Carl's pretending he would

2122
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:24,544
I suspect people just see it as a pathetic desperate man trying to get attention the only way he knows how

2123
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,104
By acting out and try to make people angry

2124
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,640
Is what children

2125
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:29,920
Yeah I wonder what

2126
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
Carl stinks

2127
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Reaction

2128
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,112
Really

2129
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Thanks

2130
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,184
Pikachu

2131
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,208
Do not understand

2132
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,024
They just absolutely have no f******

2133
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,816
Conclude

2134
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,840
No it wouldn't

2135
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:52,704
Baby a section of people

2136
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:58,080
They would be well within the right to be mad

2137
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:03,456
But the responsible most people would just be like

2138
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,248
If you're sincere cool

2139
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
And if you're not you're a dick

2140
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
Especially since

2141
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
Alex

2142
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,720
Most people respond to it

2143
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,488
Wow

2144
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,888
This is what I really need

2145
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:24,192
How the mighty have fallen

2146
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,544
October

2147
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,640
16th episode is one of the weirder disasters I've seen and Alex's

2148
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,176
Present

2149
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,224
Libras are religious

2150
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Fanaticism

2151
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:39,808
Nothing

2152
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,576
It's a meaningless

2153
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Probably

2154
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:47,488
The genetically predisposed yes

2155
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:53,120
They nonsense about TV shows making

2156
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,144
You fond of him

2157
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,472
Then turning into a pageant of

2158
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,752
Trying

2159
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,592
Sargon of akkad into liking him racist

2160
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,248
Establishing

2161
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,272
Power dynamic

2162
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,320
By lying about the real world

2163
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,392
Lestat enter the bubble of Infowars coverage

2164
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,696
I just think it's a terrible show

2165
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,000
And you add into the two

2166
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
Back problems

2167
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:25,120
Just awful

2168
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,192
Right unfortunately Alex has a different position

2169
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:33,056
Credible

2170
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,904
Marisqueria

2171
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:55,328
Focusing on them

2172
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:57,888
Your energy

2173
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,336
They have nothing

2174
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,384
They have nothing

2175
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:11,456
Just trying to ask this overarching question

2176
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
And after

2177
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,320
Pretty much publicly apologizing for screaming at the crew off air

2178
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,880
Between commercial breaks

2179
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,904
If he's

2180
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,696
Bringing it up on air

2181
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:28,096
If he's bringing it up on are then that means that he did something real f*****-up affair

2182
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,376
I would assume

2183
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,400
Navigate through

2184
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:32,704
Maybe

2185
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,752
You know

2186
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,848
He's trying to ask overarching big question of like how do we deal with

2187
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,896
Throws death throes of globalist

2188
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:43,200
Can do is make a joke

2189
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:47,040
Like a little dismissive joke referencing back to the

2190
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,416
This is nothing

2191
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:56,000
This show is terrible

2192
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,280
Disabled at this point I doubt

2193
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,560
There's any purpose in Opa

2194
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,352
That all

2195
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
Jesus

2196
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,400
This show sucks

2197
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,984
I think that there is value in

2198
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,544
I need to at least in some fashion

2199
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:10,080
Keep track of the fact that Alex

2200
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,664
In the early stages of pivoting in

2201
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,200
And to being a outright called

2202
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,992
Yeah

2203
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:17,760
McKay's

2204
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:21,856
Yeah people to take that seriously and even if it stopped

2205
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:24,928
We will take the other things that he's clearly manifesting

2206
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,696
Seriously

2207
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,024
If sincere and real

2208
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:31,584
It's only a matter of time before something really bad had

2209
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,888
If not sincere

2210
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,704
Still if you care about him

2211
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,984
You should not be allowed him to

2212
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,032
Yeah

2213
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:43,104
What wouldn't surprise me at all

2214
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,896
Based on the trends that we're

2215
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
Is as

2216
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:46,944
Like the Maine

2217
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,712
Stream

2218
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
Quote

2219
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:49,760
All right

2220
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,040
Media

2221
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Transit

2222
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,112
A Transformer and Alex

2223
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,928
I wouldn't be surprised if next year

2224
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:59,744
All of their shows are apocalyptically religious

2225
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,512
Sand

2226
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,536
Openly racist

2227
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,608
I think a number of them already are

2228
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,632
I don't

2229
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,656
I don't know what to say

2230
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
Expect

2231
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,472
I don't think there's a lot of

2232
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,824
Ways for me to know what the

2233
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,896
Does the larger right-wing media is going

2234
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:20,224
To do cuz it seems Maybe

2235
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:26,112
If its history is Prelude that maybe that is what we would expect but also I think there's a possibility

2236
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,416
That if things get bad enough

2237
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,488
