1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,944
Important

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,600
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,792
Fix-It around where's for The Elder of Celine little bit about Alex

6
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Question for you what's up

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot today is

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
Bright spot in his that I did finish making this

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Congratulate

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,408
I've been sore for two days because of it

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
And I'm also now really freaked out because we have switch

13
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Like iPhones

14
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,416
We had to unplug all of the mics and everything in order to move

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Stuff around I'm so scared that this

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Is it going to be completely f***** up

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Let's see what happen

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
It's a move towards like a little bit of

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
Renovating the office makes it sound like

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,544
Turn down a wall

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
Moving a few things around to make it feel more like a working

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Read

23
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,296
Decorating but decorating sounds more fun

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Turn it into a work work the area

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
We got that process being in

26
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
In-motion

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Is a

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
It looks really

29
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
I think it was a good

30
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
There's a place for

31
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
For the printer down there a little Shelf

32
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,520
For the

33
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Space X actually a shelf

34
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Like my old desk was just an L it was there were no shelves no drawers nothing

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,040
It looks more like a cafeteria table that it

36
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
My bright spot Dan is of course we had a wonderful interview with Jon Ronson

37
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
And everybody's

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Response to that has been

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Very very

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
Pine-Sol by bright spot is how great it was that we got to do all that

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
In Spanish

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Was really hoping it would be

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
My desk

44
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,432
Carroll's open your bright smile also be my death

45
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Really surreal week

46
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
Anime Tucker Carlson episode on Monday and then

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Interview with John on the highway

48
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
On Wednesday

49
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
It's been a little bit off the beaten path

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Indeed

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
It's felt very disorienting

52
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
And then you add that to a new desk

53
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,424
And you did just like I don't even know where we are anymore

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
It is a whole new world yeah I feel completely untethered to the last 600 episodes of our show

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,664
And now I've got new headphones on I don't know what

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
What

57
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
God

58
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
So Jordan say we're going to get back to normal

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,952
Switch when we talkin about November 9th

60
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
And

61
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
This is

62
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Dumb show

63
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,400
There's a couple of parts that are incredibly fascinating

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Really f******

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Stupid alright

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Amazon talking about all that

67
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
First Jordan

68
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
I think we should say hello to

69
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Doesn't

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
So first Getty museum thank you so much and I'll probably walk

71
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
Solenidae

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Thank you very much litotes motherfuker thank you so much

73
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,559
I finally realized

74
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,911
Start paying immediately

75
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
This fella is actually an old friend of mine back from the days of Columbia

76
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,943
Excited to say hello

77
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Lego and I couldn't find the Hallmark gift theme for 600 so here is Ace

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Subscription instead

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Just about your now policy walk

80
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Thank you very much

81
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,327
Start this episode hear about

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
November 9th

83
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Contacts dropped

84
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
But it's also kind of a game

85
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,775
Alex calls somebody a loser on this show

86
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
I need you to try and guess

87
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
Who that person is now think about the news that's going on right maybe

88
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
You know good sort of

89
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Picadillo that Alex has like

90
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Vaccination

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
It is so okay

92
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
So my first instinct I want to say it's AOC just because she drink that soda and people responded

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
Was was that before or after the night

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,839
We got to consider that were a few days back here

95
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Good point

96
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
I mean it seems too obvious

97
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
It seems too obvious but I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go with

98
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Kamala Harris

99
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
You are incorrect

100
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
Terry Bradshaw

101
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
Everyone talking s*** about Aaron Rodgers

102
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Terry Bradshaw gets agates

103
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,511
Taking down to page

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,375
Terry Bradshaw Terry Bradshaw I'm sure he has his problems

105
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
4 super

106
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Happy professionally he's not a loser

107
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,591
He's one of the best quarterbacks of all time I mean if you if you want to measure it by those statistics

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
6 bad it's not all about Rings or whatever

109
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,271
That's a very strange thing to do I mean you might you might say that he's kind of

110
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
Dorky commentator

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,975
Is generally a s******* I'm sure you know I mean you can't be in the professional sports world for long

112
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
That for that long without the

113
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,839
It seems like it's possible but I don't know

114
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
He's taking him it's just about Aaron Rodgers

115
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Anyway Alex opens

116
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
The show with a

117
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Jack dance

118
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Bombshell

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Piece of information that will be

120
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
The number one story throughout this entire episode

121
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Repeats this headline about

122
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
1000 f****** time

123
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Here we go

124
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,855
Ladies and gentlemen Tuesday November 9th 2021

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
You are a regular

126
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
You'll be able to hear me read you this headline

127
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,071
You just saw the headline front and center

128
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
Shannon says people are taking three shots and have quote no antibodies

129
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
Or covid-19 and are catching

130
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,383
They're answer more shots that's like saying

131
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
If you cut one of your fingers off with a meat cleaver

132
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Way to fix it

133
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
The cut-off three more

134
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Maybe slit your throat

135
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Hang yourself

136
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Or shoot yourself

137
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Or drink cyanide

138
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Put the baby in the microwave

139
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Give fibroids

140
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
War on

141
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
Logic and reality happening do war on logic has been waived

142
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
I mean

143
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Is the one that

144
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
He's waging right

145
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Now

146
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Haha

147
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Because that one is intense and years-long

148
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,063
As somebody who

149
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
You're constantly bang on this drum but somebody who studied

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Pharmalogic

151
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Can College

152
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
I don't

153
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Know if there's a war on logic in the same way that outer space there is

154
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
He's on the wrong side of that

155
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
I know from what I understand

156
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
If

157
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
If and let's go through let's try this life

158
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
If getting shot

159
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
Increases your immunity to disease

160
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
And your immunity

161
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Decreases then you get another shot

162
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Would that not

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Exactly like

164
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
If you

165
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
How to finger and then you chopped It Off

166
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
Yeah and it would kind of be like throwing a baby in a microwave

167
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Maladies

168
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
The one thing

169
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Here is that Alex is correct about this

170
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
Does headline say quote

171
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
Three shots and one booster later this man has little protection against

172
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Covid-19

173
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
However Alex's misrepresented

174
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
The contents

175
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
The story

176
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,223
This is about a guy who had a kidney transplant in 2019 and has to be on immunosuppressant

177
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Drugs for the rest

178
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Have his life

179
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
The article is about how he does not have antibodies

180
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Despite getting vaccinated

181
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Which event serves as a launching pad.

182
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
Discuss how many moderate-to-severe Lee immunocompromised people

183
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
We're having difficulty with creating my antibodies

184
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
This is really shity but it's also not totally surprising

185
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
And since this is the case with many vacs

186
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
In fact it's one of the really strong rebuttals to the whole anti-vax argument about how like if you're vaccinated why do you care if I

187
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
More.

188
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
That's really weird

189
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
Is this headline works for Alex if he lies about the content

190
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
But if you actually engaged with the body of a text at all

191
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
He's actually covering a story that

192
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Pro Universal vaccination

193
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Very weird

194
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,559
The really great case study for why Alex can never afford to go any deeper than surface-level on any of the stories

195
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Seat covers

196
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
If you actually gets into the meat and the details of the topic

197
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
He quickly have no legs

198
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
To stand on his narrative

199
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Completely collapse

200
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
So as an exercise I track

201
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Text through this episode

202
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
If he ever said anything about

203
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
This article other than the head

204
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Not once not once

205
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
He just says the headline about

206
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
X

207
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
And at no point discusses how it's about immunocompromised people

208
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
They had line is about 1 supposed

209
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Pacific person who was the recipient of

210
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Kidney transplant

211
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Ridiculous

212
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Adidas music

213
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Hey there

214
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
You know they're saying

215
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Get the shots it doesn't matter just have to might as well be Saline

216
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
I wonder if headline writers

217
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
The editors in the the people who put those leads

218
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Shop Fair

219
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
I wonder if they have a real awareness of how much

220
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Damage they into the

221
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Visually can do

222
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Isn't it it's an interesting

223
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
Hope they don't

224
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
Because it's more careful

225
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
You don't believe when you lead with the headline like that Alex can absolutely do that another

226
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
These people are going to read the body the article so it's

227
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
So you're like immediately the first line of defense against after it's sold out its someone enabling 22 right

228
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
Articles with headlines like that

229
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,199
The headline is fair and it is a summation of

230
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
The story it doesn't capture all the relevant details like

231
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
Has little protection

232
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,231
Why is that spelled out in the head but it's also not like

233
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
I think from a journalist

234
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Call totally absolutely

235
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
In a world where disinformation wasn't

236
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
That's such a big problem that was totally fine.

237
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Text more when I'm

238
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
I'm thinking of his like

239
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
I understand that according to these certain neutral atom

240
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
You're good

241
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
But we don't live

242
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,599
Yeah and I see this conversation, periodically on Twitter and up social media the idea that

243
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
These mainstream media Outlets

244
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Big media entities

245
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
They really need to have somebody Wonder

246
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
Understands this information on the payroll right

247
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
Because if you did you could be like you do you know what's going to happen with this headline

248
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
So it's not as useful to

249
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Folks

250
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
Like Alex B

251
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
I think the theory for why that doesn't happen is because there

252
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Concerned they would make less money

253
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Maybe

254
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
And I also think that

255
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
There's also a pretty solid argument to be made that

256
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
If you did play that bit of Defense

257
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
The enterprising people on the right with the analysis

258
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
Media sphere we just find a way to still make the same disinformation

259
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
Actually help

260
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Is going to be one step

261
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Find the newest yeah

262
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Yeah

263
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,311
So Alex wise a little bit about this article and then he lies more about something else

264
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,919
Free shots in one booster lighter three shots and one booster later

265
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,759
This man has little protection

266
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
Resizer in moderna now have

267
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
What you're both based on Ivermectin

268
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
Your why not lie about that

269
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Interesting

270
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
It would be

271
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Surely some new deadly virus

272
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Populating

273
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Okay

274
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Obviously not true

275
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,799
Even mean for a pillow to be based on Ivermectin put

276
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,615
The general claim Alex's referring to here is

277
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Just it was a meme that went around on social media

278
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
People were claiming that the Pfizer pill is

279
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Just repackaged Ivermectin

280
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
Hey when does Florida State College Pfizer Mexican

281
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
Oh boy

282
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
It does not take much

283
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
That was a fun story but it's just dumb

284
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,815
The Pfizer pill is an antiviral drug where is Ivermectin is an anti parasite medication

285
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
They operating entirely different ways and have basically no can

286
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Connection

287
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
Fact check on this claim they talk to Doctor William Penn

288
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Trivia

289
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Professor of infectious

290
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
Diseases at University of Virginia

291
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
I got the best of nation I could imagine

292
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,735
Quote the only way they are alike is that they are both

293
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Pills

294
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
This is Alex's relationship with information just like in a nutshell

295
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
PCS claims in memes on social media money

296
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
Yeah they say the things that he wants to believe the reports them to his already

297
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Just up

298
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Pathetic state of

299
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
I mean it

300
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
The little bit like

301
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Like how

302
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Abraham

303
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Vampire Hunter

304
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
Hunter is based on Abraham Lincoln

305
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
You could say it's bad

306
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
The horror movie

307
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,271
I would love it if instead of tomorrow's news

308
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Today in Florida started with

309
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Based on me

310
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Did Alex Kim Dover

311
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,975
Glanced at a me but now he's going to yell about something for an hour

312
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Great

313
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Seriously you should take this b*******

314
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
The Alex Jones Show

315
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Minut

316
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Impressions yes

317
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Alex has

318
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
So I went to the gas that's going to be coming up

319
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
In the second hour and he has a bombshell

320
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Piece of information

321
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
In about California pilot

322
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Okay this is

323
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Is this is big

324
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Kuru

325
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Coming up

326
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Are we

327
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
Journalist on very respected also scientist

328
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Major inventor

329
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
Who has sources confirming to him that Newsome

330
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
Partially paralyzed with Guillain-Barre a

331
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
And that is why he has not been seen

332
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
12

333
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
Days and counting

334
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Moderna shot

335
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
14 days ago

336
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Well I mean there's

337
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
No other possible

338
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Sure

339
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,087
Also this guy's not investigative reporter at all we'll find that out later but

340
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Also this is pretty bad timing

341
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Coming for the scoop

342
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
To drop cuz Gavin Newsom made

343
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Appearance of the vaccine clinic on Wednesday

344
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
The day after the scepter

345
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
So does recorded

346
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
And he was standing up walking

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Sitting and looking very healthy

348
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
They got f

349
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Sdr2 stand up to

350
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
Questions in a reporter asked about the rumors that he had an adverse reaction to

351
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
The vaccine

352
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
And that an anonymous source had said that he

353
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
He had

354
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Gavin Newsom

355
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,527
Yeah well that's made up I had absolutely no impact whatsoever from bacova

356
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
The chat Noir from the original or the booster

357
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Absolutely not no fee

358
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Fatigue even though sore

359
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
I was busy doing things for

360
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Come on man we'll get to that later

361
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,679
Respected investigative journalist has to say about this

362
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
Actually invented

363
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
An early Mouse

364
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
He's actually

365
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
The early search engine

366
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Yeah but he's also gone off his rocker

367
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
He actually does have some credit

368
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
It's to his name

369
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Investigative journalist I don't know if

370
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
It's one of those

371
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
So Alex

372
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
He's internalize this

373
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Nation about

374
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Allegedly Tyler Newsome Heaven gion beret

375
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
And he's decided that he kind of wants Gavin Newsom

376
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,055
Also doesn't want to say I wish death upon him

377
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
Kind of got a dance around a little bit

378
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Fare well I mean it's

379
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
It's interesting to see a little Shuffle

380
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
He's doing

381
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
And only very very clear about this

382
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Anybody

383
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Really

384
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,767
I don't take Glee in the house Fallin Governor Newsom is but I

385
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
I hope and pray

386
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
God works

387
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
His miracles here

388
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
And that Newsome either be spared but repent and come out

389
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
He needs to die

390
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,991
That would be a blessing in California

391
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,599
Take it to go to the park or go to the mall or go get a hamburger

392
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
Go to the doctor go to school I mean there

393
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Experimental deadly shot

394
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
Some dies

395
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,471
In California before our children died

396
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Express

397
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
Yeah

398
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
He decided to take it

399
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
I asked God to strike him down

400
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,319
I always like it when I wouldn't do something like that where he's like backing

401
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
Fourth all over the place

402
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Starts with

403
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Let me be absolutely clear

404
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
Who did the absolutely clear

405
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
Hey not

406
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Jupiter Ed

407
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
Myself a bunch of times but I'm being super clear about that all right

408
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
First preference

409
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
I want

410
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
All the kids

411
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
In the world to have a million dollars

412
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
Beach but if we can't do that I think Governor Newsom

413
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Some should be killed by gun

414
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,039
I would like God to strike him down so if it

415
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Listen to the kids

416
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,415
You know me you know that my first preference is no one gets hurt and all

417
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
Get a million dollars but since that's

418
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
That's not going to happen

419
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,815
I would also strong lyrics

420
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Cute Galaxy

421
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
Has claimed that he doesn't want anyone to be hurt

422
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
I think he wants a lot of people

423
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Strongly

424
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
We've heard him

425
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Furlough

426
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
General lien

427
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Consistently

428
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
So apparently Alex's changing the story a little bit now originally it was

429
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
That Gavin Newsom had Guillain-Barre

430
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
Maybe it's something else

431
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Where's Governor Newsom

432
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
2 weeks ago

433
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
We had a source coming on the confirmed with my chores for saying

434
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
A partially paralyzed that has Bell's palsy

435
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Beyonder a Bell's Palsy same

436
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775
Different names

437
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
This is so not true

438
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,199
We're just going to go with that one you would only say that if you are making s*** up

439
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Totally that's for that's braids

440
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,111
Hopkins Bell's Palsy is an unexplained episode of facial muscles

441
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Weakness or proud

442
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,023
Conversely Guillain-Barre is a full-body autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks its

443
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Nerves

444
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Sometimes Bell's palsy

445
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
We can accompany

446
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
Ombre but only an idiot would try to say that they're the same condition with different names

447
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Which is why

448
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Alex just said that cuz you the f****** idiot

449
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Yeah

450
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
That's that's real bad

451
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
Pretty pretty silly

452
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
It's hard to hear somebody say that and not

453
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Just go there's nothing you want say

454
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
You're just you're just free

455
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,367
Yeah I almost I almost

456
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
Be your friend

457
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
10 Vietnam grudging way

458
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,559
Anyway also another thing that Alex does besides a lie is

459
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Promote memes

460
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,191
Around

461
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Everybody should share

462
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,407
Live show fiza broadcast today so you can share it

463
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
It's

464
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Oh my God

465
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Young people

466
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Are suddenly dying everywhere

467
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
The man says while he's reading

468
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Laptop

469
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
He looks up with his coffee in his hand and says oh wait

470
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
That's completely normal according to this

471
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
I'm going to guess

472
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
But this is some

473
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Formulation of the

474
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
Guy sitting at a table

475
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,823
The house is on fire any like this is fine

476
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,407
It's some sort of version of that or some sort of take on that I'm not sure

477
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,015
I think that Alex was a serious high-minded person I don't know how much time he would spend

478
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Promoting memes

479
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
Yeah I mean there's too many Ben Garrison

480
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
Comics out there so it's a waste your time on me

481
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,256
Yeah I know you've seen all those dogs before

482
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
But have you seen a dog

483
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Label

484
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
That's true

485
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
We do need some labels on this ship I do like that song though

486
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Give Me Back My Bullets

487
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
That's all I could think about

488
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Fun

489
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
So we get this

490
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Investigative journalist

491
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Showing up

492
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Play the gentleman by the name of Steve

493
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Kirsch

494
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
Nearest Alex giving him a little in

495
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Intro

496
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Well we had dr. McCullough in studio with asset last Friday and he knocked it out of the park the true leader and he said listen

497
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Bauer Speck

498
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Really

499
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
It's on the ball like no other is Steve Kerr son

500
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Absolutely

501
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
He's really been organizing the top Minds

502
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
That wasn't fighting this incredible

503
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
Rollout of tyranny that we've been witnessing

504
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Alex just didn't say please

505
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Is before

506
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
I've been trying to get ahold of that guy forever

507
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
And then you gave me his email address I'm at work

508
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
Crazy Steve has a really interesting

509
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Sting figure

510
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,608
Like you made Millions like I mentioned that money founded Infosys

511
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
Which was basically Google before Google

512
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Right like it was early search engine

513
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Or not evil enough

514
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
And after that he turned his Focus to philanthropy

515
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
An early in the covid epidemic

516
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,480
He started an organization called covid-19 early treatment

517
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Fun twitch stopped

518
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
Provide funding

519
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,136
The research that was going into existing already approved drugs that could be effective

520
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Infighting covid

521
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Which honestly is a great

522
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Thing to do cuz no one was doing it back then

523
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
And the possibility of what

524
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
You could find

525
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Is really

526
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
Important know that the problem with you saying something

527
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Open like that is now that I know he's on Infowars right eyes narrow into a very ripe horrifying like

528
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,408
How is this anti-abortion somehow like a nut kind of level of I don't care

529
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,504
Early on in the pandemic of funneling million

530
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Dollars

531
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
To research

532
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
They could be from a bowl

533
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
A wonderful thing to do

534
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,232
There's a drug out there that has promised that we're already familiar with

535
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
We were going to know that

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Unfortunately he kind of lost his mind at some point along the way

537
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
What are the grants that his group gave out was

538
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
112

539
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,056
$25,000 which was given to a researcher from the University of Minnesota named David boulware

540
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
It was meant to study the efficacy of Hydrox

541
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Oxy chloroquine

542
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
I found that there was

543
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
No benefit

544
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
To taking the drug

545
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Didn't accept the result

546
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
And the interpretation of the research

547
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
And things fell apart from

548
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,952
As the pandemic has gone on he's shifted from promoting infective drugs

549
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,280
Being convinced that everyone's trying to conspire against

550
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
Drugs that he's decided are effective

551
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Like hydroxychloroquine

552
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
10 + Ivermectin

553
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
This is predictably spoiled

554
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
Spiraled out of control into basically and

555
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Strong anti-vax

556
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
According to a write-up in

557
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Technology review quote

558
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,224
In May all 12 members of the covid-19 early treatment fun scientific

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Advisory Board resign

560
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,344
Citing curses alarming dangerous claims and erratic Behavior

561
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
Most of the scientific Community has lost its patience

562
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
For him and the only real rolly is left

563
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
Play the hero to the anti-vax community

564
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,352
That must reach the point where he's going on Infowars to talk about how vaccines

565
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Evil and Gavin Newsom may be paralyzed

566
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
The desperation is a little bit depressing

567
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
But it is what it

568
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
Yeah I mean it

569
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,664
Hard not to see the exact same thing play out over and over and over again whenever it comes

570
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Comes to money and Sia

571
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
No no you don't understand

572
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
When I pay you this money

573
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
It's to come up with the conclusion that I want

574
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Why are you coming back with something

575
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
It's not what I want you don't understand how money

576
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Also I'm curious if Alex knows that one of the other medications that

577
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,584
He's pushing his like a potential covid

578
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Treatment is Luvox

579
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Which is the present

580
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Pretty sure Alex will be again

581
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
And that even if it was effective against

582
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
That's covid and then I could help him not have

583
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Yassin's

584
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah for everybody but it also is one of the antidepressant for the ape

585
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
I'd really be a pickle

586
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,272
That would be tough if it turned out that my meds

587
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,344
We're also immunizing me to Cullman

588
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
He be like damn it I don't even know what

589
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
Also I wonder if Alex is going to ask this dude about

590
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
The company that he founded

591
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
2011

592
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
I'm called one eye

593
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
It seems like Alex is so obsessed with the idea that the globalist want to create digital IDs for everyone that they can use to implement assoc

594
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Credit score

595
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Important to ask this guy

596
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
Steve about how he founded a company that was

597
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,384
Nobby who's building an ID system that could be

598
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
Conceivably seen as the backbone for such a global esteem I would

599
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
Be curious if he wants to ask about that

600
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
It doesn't come up with Alex has no idea

601
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Mark of the beast Unlimited

602
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Probably going to ignore that one

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,864
Anyway immediately undercuts his own argument about Gavin Newsom here

604
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm not quite sure where to start should we start with

605
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
Into the details

606
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,944
For close to two weeks

607
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,016
His face is paralyzed

608
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
After two weeks you can look completely normal

609
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
So he can go

610
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,632
Supposed to be

611
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
And so he

612
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Totally normal

613
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Now

614
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
Excuse to say

615
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
Well you know I was out of commission for some reason

616
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
When you look at all the

617
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
You did your investigations I did my investigations and they were all consistent with someone who is

618
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Yeah what are these investigations

619
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Call Jerry Irving

620
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Someone was talking s***

621
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
That's mighty sweet of this gate

622
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Inquiring minds want to know

623
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Is your face paralyzed

624
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,824
You keeping score when Gavin Newsom finally appears in public if half of his face

625
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Paralyzed then he was injured by the vaccine and he was in hiding

626
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,248
If he appears that he's totally normal that he was injured by the vaccine buddy

627
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
He's already recovered

628
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,136
Google really fun game that's being played where no matter what ends up happening Steve gets

629
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Supertime that is predicted

630
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Came true

631
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
Here's some free advice

632
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
If someone is pretending to have great insight and information but they also make

633
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
The prediction that boils down to a situation where both

634
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
A and not a

635
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
Gets to be claimed of the win for them

636
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Don't listen to them

637
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
They're idiots

638
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Also

639
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
It's important to acknowledge

640
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
But Newsome was

641
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Missing or in hiding

642
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,968
You just cancelled his scheduled appearance at the UN climate Summit on pretty short notice

643
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
Even before he gave a press conference at the vaccine clinic on that Wednesday he was photographed it IV Geddes very so

644
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Subtle and restrained wedding on November 7th

645
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
2 days before this episode released

646
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
Who was recorded

647
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,840
Even beyond that he claimed that he canceled his trip because he has Young

648
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,912
Young children and felt really guilty about the idea that both of them

649
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Both him and his wife

650
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Will be taking this trip to

651
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Scotland during Halloween

652
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
Whose kids would end up missing out on trick-or-treating

653
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:35,712
August was actually an easier decision for him because he was only given a 3-minute speaking slotted

654
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Pat Summitt

655
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
Just kind of hard to justify a trip around the world

656
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
For when his Deputy could

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
You just go

658
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,928
And for the level of nothing you're going to do that's just I mean

659
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
Alright so here's what it is

660
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Alright

661
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Go to cop26

662
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
You can give you 3 minutes Peach

663
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
And you have some nice

664
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
War

665
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
You can go to the wedding of modern royalty f*** around

666
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,872
I say something like let them eat cake and then we all move on with our lives

667
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,224
You know that's a good day and an article that I was reading made a good point and that is that like

668
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
In the past

669
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
When there have been

670
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Rob black Republican Administration

671
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
It it been boring

672
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Important for

673
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Let's say the California governor

674
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,256
To be like Saturday

675
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
That was being taken on by the GOP

676
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Has president

677
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
That roll

678
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Is less import

679
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,288
And so him showing up there didn't really matter as much as it might've ryra in other years

680
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
The question comes into like

681
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Please have the last Publika

682
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Appearances

683
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
You know why

684
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Cuz he had an

685
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Giant empty

686
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
B space cuz he was scheduled to be in

687
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Yeah that would be

688
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,744
Typically makes a lot of public appearances but his calendar was empty because it was Friday

689
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Scotland

690
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:58,144
Yeah I know he had nothing you needed to do so you could take familytime up chill and go to this

691
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
Getty wedding

692
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
I do like to have that would

693
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
To be accepted

694
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,568
I would like nobody would be in like these people wouldn't be like oh that may

695
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,640
Makes perfect sense schedule and there's nothing

696
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,224
Taking my schedule then I don't have to do anything till Hangout

697
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
They're they're like now

698
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
If you cancel the

699
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
26

700
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Then you just got your back

701
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,952
Schedule did you have to go do immediately have a backup schedule

702
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Yeah

703
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
It's the simplest explanation and it makes

704
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
He always double books

705
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Every

706
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
It's just in case

707
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Might be

708
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Very dumb

709
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,824
Cigna dumb Steve has a position that is just

710
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
Unfounded

711
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
In reality

712
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
This

713
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
Vaccine is the most dangerous

714
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,552
History

715
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Then

716
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,672
The previous record holder

717
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
One person per million vaccinated

718
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,352
Just for 800 people

719
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,520
150000

720
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
8 different ways that we go and look at that

721
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
To show that there are over 100

722
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
50000 people that are bad

723
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
By this vaccine

724
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,112
To get into these eight different ways but it doesn't really

725
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
Every single thing that he discusses

726
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
About

727
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Substantiate this stuff

728
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
Is based on misrepresentations of bears

729
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,192
Useless to conclusions about causality

730
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,752
I kind of stopped and it's like it's so disappointing

731
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
It's so such a bummer

732
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Much just very state

733
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
I was assuming

734
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,480
That the only place he could get the world record holder was the Guinness Book of World

735
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
Sure

736
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
You needed someone

737
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Come out and certify it though if you want to go get it the book

738
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,768
That is true how would you how would you observe that it would be hard

739
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
I need to be

740
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
Omnipresent

741
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,168
Okay

742
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Steve

743
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Has this

744
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Kind of flawed thinking

745
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Where

746
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
He's put out a million-dollar bill

747
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
That his data is right

748
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,040
No one is taking

749
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
He's been proven right

750
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
I'll take it right now

751
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
Even

752
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,608
The number to people

753
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Are killed by

754
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
That you easily

755
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Whatever

756
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Nobody

757
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Really

758
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Because nobody's taking

759
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Well

760
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
There's a couple problems here you'll take it other people would take it too I'm sure

761
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
People on Twitter have taken it and proving it

762
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
But I also think

763
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,512
Okay this is not a good way to

764
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
To determine whether or not people disagree with you

765
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
Because people might think you're a s******* ensure I just not want

766
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
Engage that might be part of

767
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
People not taking your back

768
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
Like the World Health Organization is not going to take this back

769
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,616
That's true CDC is not going to take your gum 10 billion dollar bet

770
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
They're busy

771
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
There aren't

772
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,528
There aren't many things that have been scientifically proven

773
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Viable

774
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
I think

775
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,392
Maybe Buckyballs are the only things attic

776
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,464
Exist scientifically because two scientist got

777
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Drunken bet each other who

778
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
Make a better believe that the

779
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,912
1918 actually was solved by game of bags

780
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Little known facts

781
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,824
Americano mower

782
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
So if there's a

783
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Barry

784
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Interesting

785
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Buona Beef

786
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
About

787
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,248
The entire vaccine program

788
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Between Steve and Alex

789
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,624
And actually this should be a deal-breaker

790
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
And Alex shouldn't be talking

791
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
This guy because

792
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
He fundamentally disagrees with the Baseline parameters

793
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
That Alex has

794
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
That this is a global depopulation

795
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Action plan

796
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
Steve does not believe that

797
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
And because Alex wants to retain some

798
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Some kind of rapport with him

799
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
Cuz if that's really popular in the community

800
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Alex has to kind of be like well

801
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
You know

802
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
It's just a theory that it's a DE populare

803
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
God this is really pathetic

804
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Yeah

805
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
You were saying that they're idiots they don't know what they're doing

806
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
Ignoring the facts of the science and just

807
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
Moving forward is suppressing

808
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,072
The illnesses in the problem by big Pharma

809
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Have somebody similar problems and so are you saying

810
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,080
They're just idiots from a top-down or are you saying that

811
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,152
They're certain compartmentalize groups that don't know what's going on because

812
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
I believe my doctors

813
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Global Force depopulation plan

814
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
What do you really think the route

815
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
Area of some speculation

816
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
I didn't know before they Circle

817
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,304
Yeah I think it's wishful thinking

818
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
20

819
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,936
Garcia said the vaccine is the only way out of this pandemic

820
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
There is no other solution

821
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Early treatment doesn't work

822
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
It's vaccine or die

823
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
Magical thinking

824
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Yeah yeah

825
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,576
She is right and they want to make sure that the vaccine Wars

826
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Somebody's looking the other way

827
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,440
Right there

828
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
There

829
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
There

830
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
So

831
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Just wishful thinking

832
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
What's going on

833
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Yeah so

834
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
Apparently

835
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
He's talking to somebody that he doesn't really want to fight with

836
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
He wants to retain the relationship

837
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,576
The idea that the globalist a depopulation plan is a matter of some speculation

838
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
As opposed to something that's been.

839
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
Documented and Alex has been proven

840
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
You proved it

841
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
420 f******

842
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
10 years has a plan that dates back to the age

843
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Which of the devil

844
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Talking nonsense

845
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
Yeah I mean if this is

846
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
If this is his level of

847
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Conviction

848
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
I'm starting to think he's not actually a psychic

849
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
I'm starting to think that you're the medic goddamn thing he says

850
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:33,408
What his prophetic dreams are way off if there is

851
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
That easy to tear down I suppose

852
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Hey look the globalist

853
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Exist now that's a matter of some

854
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,392
Speculation had said in the pet groomers are

855
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
I backpedal tomorrow you dumb

856
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Dumb dick

857
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
Alright so

858
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,656
Steve I have no respect for really based on his present

859
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Except for disagreeing with Alex

860
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
At least that

861
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Take some like

862
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Do you have the position

863
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah yeah I guess I respect that

864
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
But if that's not doesn't mean

865
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Yeah I do respect anybody

866
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
Who doesn't immediately yes

867
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
And to Alex's bulshit I'll give him one point for that

868
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
For all the

869
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,392
Misuse of various data all the other points are gone

870
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes and then this disqualifies

871
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
If your

872
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,864
I 840 example

873
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752
Vaccine efficacy goes negative to like 104%

874
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
Which means that you're twice as likely

875
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,128
To get covid if you've been vaccinated

876
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
Opposite of the story

877
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
And we are records

878
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Headliners morning explaining that their answers always more shots

879
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,024
Give you a negative immunity compared to one and immersing the answers more

880
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
So that's just a

881
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Steve reporting

882
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
Fake misrepresented bulshit

883
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:04,288
I was a article in the expose that video about weed

884
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Episode 209

885
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
And then you hear Alex

886
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Just trying to connect it to the headlines

887
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
But he's not even talked about the body of the article

888
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
From the beginning

889
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Main story of the day

890
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,880
I I think that anybody who repeats that narrative about the UK

891
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
Stuff is just like

892
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
Well you're gone you're not even serious about this

893
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Find the most

894
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Disgusting about it is

895
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
How

896
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
You can miss remember

897
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
The lies

898
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
Is told about an article

899
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
So much

900
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
That when you were

901
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Keep them to Alex

902
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
It is almost as if you are referencing a

903
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Completely different

904
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Story

905
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Making people feel like oh you're back

906
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
Get up with different research

907
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,136
Yeah played it being the same research you're just so bad at remembering you don't even bother getting right

908
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah yeah it's a bummer

909
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
That's a real bummer

910
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,024
So Alex has a little bit of information

911
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
May or may not be from a man

912
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
Maybe if I roll video okay

913
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
It has to do with stroke

914
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
People getting Strokes

915
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
And then something really terrifying

916
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,176
Are there different shirt

917
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,016
And you're a between 61 and 65 depending what test I've seen

918
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
I'll be patiently today let's go

919
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,928
Give me the shot

920
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,256
Simple form of trial that 65%

921
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Blood clots

922
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
I'm sure

923
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
Cancel my Twitter account

924
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,920
I just got a notice breaking

925
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
Social credit score

926
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
Unsurprisingly Alex is going off

927
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
Very suspect

928
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
Sinbad piece of information making

929
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Disclaim

930
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,720
It's not from any published or even unpublished study there's no data to fact

931
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
This up

932
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Like I hinted at the

933
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
Viral video that is posted by a guy

934
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
Dr. Charles Hoff

935
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
It's not from

936
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
I like

937
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
A bunch of doctors in

938
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,800
Between 60 and 65% based on their patients set

939
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Just one guy who made of

940
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Video Gray

941
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
He's provided no evidence or data and the thing is that even if he did produce data that reflected what he claimed

942
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Still wouldn't mean anything conclusive

943
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Claims that he's done D-dimer test

944
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
Song people who recently got the Cobra drag

945
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
And it's 62% of them had elevated

946
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
D-dimer levels

947
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,352
Isis argument goes the elevated D-dimer levels are evident

948
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
What's a blood clot

949
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
However according to a fact-checking Reuters

950
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Quote

951
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
D-dimer is a blood protein

952
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Speed released when a blood clot

953
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
A blood clot

954
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Begin

955
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
To dissolve a breakdown

956
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
When the D-dimer level is high

957
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,432
Handicap because of

958
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
But there are other

959
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Possible causes

960
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Including

961
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Currency cigarette smoking

962
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
Inflammation

963
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Or Advanced age

964
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
You could just be an older person

965
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:06,048
Sure elevated levels I do think that all those people who say that there are

966
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Possible like their ammo

967
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Possible

968
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Causes for the

969
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
Same like result

970
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Their obvious

971
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,032
There's only one

972
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Different cars

973
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
Is coming to the same result that doesn't make any sense

974
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,456
I mean you're speaking truth here Maya

975
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
It look if you chop off your finger

976
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
You know that's like

977
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
Put your baby in the microwave

978
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
I can't dispute that or else I would be

979
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,976
Waging a war against logic

980
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Even if Hoffa

981
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,376
Perfectly collected set of data that showed elevated D-dimer levels in these people

982
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,960
Still wouldn't prove that there is a high rate of blood clots among them

983
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
He still have so much more work to do

984
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Before he could read anything close to a conclusion

985
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,895
But you wouldn't get that impression if you just watched his viral video

986
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
It's pretty emphatic about reaching a conclusion

987
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,527
It seems like what happened here is that Alex just watch that

988
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,575
Warsaw being based on that video

989
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,671
Any decided to do literally no further work on the subject just chose to

990
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
Report this as definitive because he's a lazy f****** liar

991
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
Also I just check Twitter and

992
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Steve account is still up

993
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
Maybe he got his account locked

994
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,679
For posting some ridiculously false s*** but he didn't

995
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
It kicked off

996
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
That's just him exaggerating

997
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,543
Victimhood and being excited about it and then Alex

998
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Just pretending it's related to him coming on his show

999
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
So he can exaggerate his own victimhood it's

1000
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
The fun game they like to play

1001
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Now they're not busy

1002
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Their nuts

1003
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
It's not like anybody's Victor

1004
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,087
Do they got the time to

1005
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,135
Find fake Waze

1006
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
So

1007
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,231
This is an amazing slip of

1008
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Patong on Alex's

1009
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Quite funny

1010
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
They're discussing how the sea

1011
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
CEO of Pfizer

1012
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Sir hiss said that

1013
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
People who

1014
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
Put out misinformation about covid and covid vaccination

1015
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Their Criminal

1016
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Because they've caused

1017
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
So much.

1018
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
I mean

1019
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
You know but I figured the CEO Pfizer

1020
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Saying that other

1021
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
People are the cause of so much

1022
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,743
Anybody spreading misinformation

1023
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
I mean that would mean that the Surgeon General

1024
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
Rochelle walensky

1025
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,127
I think that's

1026
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
Right they are spreading misinformation

1027
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Order directly using the term

1028
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,879
Get a function of the head of the CDC said

1029
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,023
All they've done is lie.

1030
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,583
Is yardstick he'll go to jail

1031
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,375
He'll go to jail too

1032
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,471
That indicates to me some Awareness on Alex's part

1033
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
He's spreading disinformation

1034
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Piplup

1035
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
It is there is a little bit of it this time

1036
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,535
If I'm going they're going and they're not going to go so they can't get me on Instagram and by that yardstick

1037
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
Because they're not going to jail how to say

1038
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,167
Because ivy

1039
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
Some b******* about that man's being dumb

1040
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
Spreading misinformation

1041
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
That is

1042
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,615
Damn I murdered somebody what I was hanging out with Bill Clinton

1043
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
So I know I'm getting off scot-free

1044
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,783
That is okay

1045
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
Maybe guilty.

1046
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,951
Fun anyway it turns out that Steve's Twitter did not get

1047
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
Yeah so my Twitter account was not to say

1048
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:55,679
Suspended

1049
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
And so

1050
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
My Twitter account

1051
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Not suspended

1052
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
Because you

1053
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
I think of it as a badge of honor that

1054
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,439
Then I'm getting their attention then

1055
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
I've gotten those emails

1056
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,863
Before black when I used to have a Twitter account

1057
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Mine

1058
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,191
I'll get those they have to verify your account

1059
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
These people just

1060
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Fetishize victimhood

1061
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
So much

1062
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
It's outrageous

1063
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Yeah I mean

1064
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,199
It is it is a little bit of that like

1065
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
These people really

1066
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,599
Should we victimize them is that what they really want

1067
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,743
It is something they want and I don't think you should give them what they want they'll pretend that you're doing it anyway

1068
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Goodbye

1069
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
So

1070
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
McDonald's Steve Steve takes off

1071
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,911
Bad batting average of people named Steve on Alex

1072
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,407
That's a real name that one's up on Infowars is usually repeated and it's always

1073
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,479
I wouldn't I wouldn't want to Jordan on Infowars

1074
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
An Infowars

1075
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Steve

1076
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Is equal to a real world

1077
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Scooter

1078
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
So what is exactly what it

1079
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
The rest of this episode could be a bit offensive

1080
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
And difficult for some folk

1081
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
Because Alec

1082
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,655
What does start talking about the

1083
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
Travis Scott concert

1084
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Oh

1085
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
No yeah

1086
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
And so if

1087
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
You know that's something that might

1088
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Be difficult

1089
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
I would advise Maybe

1090
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,687
You want to skip the rest of this episode is Alex is

1091
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Pretty gross

1092
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
And on the

1093
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
I'm so here is him suggesting

1094
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
At that concert

1095
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
People who died there

1096
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
It might have been a demonic sacrifice

1097
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
Devil

1098
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
Blood sacrifice

1099
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
I wasn't sure about this over the weekend

1100
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,959
I saw the advertisement

1101
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Houston Chronicle

1102
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
What was Chad

1103
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,847
I don't know if the artist

1104
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
Travis Scott

1105
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,551
But the organizers certainly is classically satanic

1106
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Sahel iconography

1107
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
And demonic invocations

1108
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
Classic tape measure

1109
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
You got everything else to it

1110
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Holyshit

1111
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
I don't like

1112
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Slither using class

1113
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,751
I think you should put your own spin on it I think this is the problem with this guy

1114
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
Is that they're just repeating old satanism

1115
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,871
You know you got to put your new spin on it

1116
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Yeah

1117
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
I think that this is a really

1118
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Disgrace

1119
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,295
Angle to take on this

1120
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Because

1121
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,623
You know there's there's obviously

1122
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
Failings that happened

1123
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,975
On the structural level between the security

1124
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Folks

1125
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
There were

1126
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Corners cut

1127
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
In terms of

1128
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
The venue in the

1129
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Putting on of the show

1130
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
And those are things

1131
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,335
Things that could probably be solved by greater regulation greater oversight

1132
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,711
In order to not have that conversation Alex is turning this into a demonic sacrifice

1133
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
And that's

1134
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Really pathetic

1135
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
And disrespectful to the people who died

1136
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
I've never heard

1137
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
I've never been like

1138
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
I was

1139
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
You know over the weekend

1140
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
I wasn't sure if it was

1141
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Was a blood sacrifice

1142
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Dot-dot-dot

1143
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
I've never said

1144
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
And I've definitely never followed that up with

1145
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
But now I am

1146
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
Then I just bet I did some research

1147
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
And I'm glad to

1148
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,151
Discover again but it wasn't for the

1149
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
10 million

1150
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
YouTube time it was not

1151
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
High blood

1152
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Yep

1153
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
So I'm going to play this

1154
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
I'm going to play all this like

1155
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,463
I can order of the things that Alex says because I want you to understand how disorienting it is sometimes to listen to

1156
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,767
So he's talking about this Travis Scott concert

1157
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Amen

1158
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
He jumps onto a completely different top

1159
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
That leaves us to that

1160
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
Notify is lgbtq

1161
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Make some more

1162
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
Politically correct

1163
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Tool

1164
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
I hate somebody just because they

1165
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
People use identify less than 1% is this

1166
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
Advertising

1167
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
This is BS in the same groups are not pushing

1168
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,951
Pedophilia this destructive

1169
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,511
Make you die alone and then

1170
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,351
Once the majority of people are not heterosexual or don't have relationships

1171
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,703
Family courts across the country

1172
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
Our children are taken

1173
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
To be given to these people because they don't have children

1174
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
It's a nightmare system

1175
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Hunted like

1176
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
The opening scene Planet of the Apes

1177
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,991
Leg running from the system

1178
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Okay

1179
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
Alright

1180
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
I think there's a pretty simple

1181
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
Reason

1182
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,255
Explanation for why they're Rising rates of people who identify as lgbtq Plus

1183
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,863
Is that the umbrella is larger than the others

1184
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
More

1185
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
I guess nuanced understanding of different identities and different

1186
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,799
Attractions

1187
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,359
I'm at the other thing is

1188
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Luther's greater except

1189
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
In society

1190
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,015
Some more people are not afraid

1191
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
You know of

1192
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,343
People don't have to hide their

1193
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Reality

1194
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,415
As much as maybe they had to

1195
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
To the Past

1196
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
I would even go so

1197
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
So far as to say that

1198
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
The rising rates

1199
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Self

1200
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Purporting

1201
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
Probably

1202
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
Did you too

1203
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,983
People no longer hunting them

1204
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,543
Has he literally literally good

1205
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
Yeah really hunting

1206
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
That's not to say we live in a perfect

1207
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,223
Time now where people aren't still persecuted

1208
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,831
For getting them I'm literally talking about they were hunted like

1209
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
With dogs

1210
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,439
Aha

1211
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
A fake thing that

1212
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
Pendleton exaggeration it's like the most dangerous game was real there's a reality that

1213
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
The rate

1214
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
Of people who are lgbtq

1215
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Thank you

1216
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Maybe are no different than they were

1217
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
6070 years ago almost exact

1218
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
But we didn't

1219
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
No because people were

1220
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Unable

1221
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
To live publicly and openly

1222
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
I think

1223
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,111
But that is probably a better explanation than

1224
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Fertilizing

1225
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
I have anagram

1226
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
Gay conspiracy in order to

1227
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,535
Make straight people hunted to their kids will be taken away

1228
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
Yes.

1229
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,399
Yeah I mean the only way to look at those numbers of like

1230
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Oh look

1231
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
There's a rising number of

1232
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
People saying the

1233
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
Is to recant

1234
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Sexualize the past

1235
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
Listen think

1236
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Look at the

1237
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
Sheer number of people

1238
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
4/4

1239
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
To live

1240
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,503
And also this 39% number I'm not

1241
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
Totally sure I wasn't able to

1242
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
I didn't dig deep enough to find the actual study

1243
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
I saw Daily Mail article

1244
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,951
Is working off of and there were some red flags around like

1245
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Article

1246
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
That number

1247
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
Anyway now that we've been

1248
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,703
Incredibly bigoted home

1249
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,751
Homophobic transphobic all across the board

1250
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:32,127
2 hours blowing hard about rituals and how Travis Scott concert with a

1251
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Ritual

1252
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:40,063
Every culture throughout human recorded history has engaged in rituals

1253
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Because of rituals

1254
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
Or archives are powerful symbols

1255
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,975
Ben unlock areas of our minds

1256
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
And compartmentalised instincts

1257
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
Of our ancestors

1258
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
That's why

1259
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:59,519
Geesh or butterflies and hummingbirds fly 345 thousand miles

1260
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,567
The place they've never been

1261
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
To make a nest

1262
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,663
Because it's in their genetics in

1263
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
Their instincts

1264
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
It's programmed in

1265
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:13,855
And so when you see a big event like happened this weekend in

1266
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Houston

1267
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,207
With more than 10 people dead hundreds and hundreds

1268
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,023
Wounded and trampled you ask

1269
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
How does this happen

1270
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,351
And then you see the big portal

1271
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
Play Crystal Ball

1272
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Hands above

1273
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,447
Shut on Saturday

1274
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Special broadcast

1275
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,847
It probably wasn't consciously a Satanic ritual well I have to

1276
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,663
Where's my cell phone that because now that time to study

1277
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
Wow Alex is making a correct

1278
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
Weird

1279
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,087
It's so weird that he never correct himself on things that he is

1280
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
Flagrantly wrong about

1281
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,647
But on this

1282
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,999
He said it wasn't a conscious Satanic ritual

1283
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
I think it was on purpose

1284
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
You know what

1285
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
Over the weekend I wasn't sure if it was a Satanic ritual and now I'm sure and then over the earlier part of the show I was

1286
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:07,103
Pretty sure it was unconscious Satanic ritual

1287
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Sky's the f****** worse

1288
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,455
You can look at this isolated say okay they didn't mean

1289
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
Whoever set it up and designed it

1290
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Travis Scott

1291
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,671
Weird seeing strange

1292
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
While people are flopping around

1293
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Do you mean like the older

1294
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
Spirit

1295
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Program inter-dimensional e

1296
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
These events

1297
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,703
Not by the colors in a lights but by the art

1298
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
Types of shows you

1299
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,079
Humans are all basically psychic once they all get on one wavelength

1300
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
Leslie take control of them

1301
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
Killed

1302
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,439
Daisy don't make sense

1303
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:58,815
Are you laid out like that like it's pretty clear-cut

1304
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,887
Cuz I wasn't sure about it and now that he's a

1305
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
Explained it clearly

1306
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
I get it

1307
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,983
Bobby IV there's no other explanation

1308
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,359
There's a demonic wavelength than anybody gets on it when you're at a concert and then

1309
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
And then the government has

1310
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
Has power over you

1311
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
Justin

1312
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,991
The government wants to do black magic

1313
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
It's cuz they have debt

1314
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,575
Sorry I'm sorry

1315
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
I'm sorry

1316
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
Old Black Magic

1317
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:29,279
What are the Middle Ages that goes back to Solomon's Temple and back to Egypt

1318
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
They believe in all this

1319
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
And they believe you need blood

1320
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,143
For power you need

1321
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,727
Pay claims to the spirits of these aliens

1322
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Tilly's Hannity's of

1323
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
Dead children and or virgins

1324
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,663
Anybody get killed but they really they're going to give you a lot of power

1325
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:54,111
That's what this is is is a bunch of demon creatures coming down and grabbing people's children and taking them

1326
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
To hell

1327
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
Yeah so they have

1328
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,487
Studies demons that you know they get power and then they have to

1329
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
Deliver the blood of children

1330
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Vergence

1331
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Alright

1332
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,655
I have a visit I have a serious problem

1333
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,191
Yeah me too

1334
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
I thought we have different

1335
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,031
Turn serious problems. Problems

1336
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
I don't understand

1337
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Are they

1338
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,431
Are there are there rituals real

1339
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
Or do they believe

1340
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,015
Clarify

1341
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:26,367
Demons themselves are real and they try to let me try to clarify your question

1342
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
Are you asking

1343
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
Whether or not

1344
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,559
Demons are real or if these people doing the rituals just

1345
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
Believe

1346
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,631
Since to be real but they're actually not

1347
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
I am asking

1348
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
What does Alex

1349
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:46,335
Masking from Alex point of view

1350
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
Alex's perspective the rituals work

1351
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
That's what I'm asking

1352
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,991
Because we've had this conversation

1353
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
3 * 40

1354
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551
I'm not saying that it's right

1355
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,599
That's what they believe is real

1356
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:02,463
It really sounds like Alex is saying we've are succeeding

1357
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,511
I actually do know from other

1358
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Conversation

1359
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,959
Yeah he tries to pretend that it's just what they believe right because that's the way you present yourself as a less

1360
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
Insane person

1361
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,055
Like when he's on Rogan show he'll pretend he doesn't believe it

1362
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,407
Fairly regularly about

1363
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:27,295
Believing that these rituals and they are demons that are being fed by the blood of children of virgins and

1364
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,087
This is like

1365
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,671
Dark Ages s***

1366
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
When you cry

1367
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Narratives

1368
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Alright

1369
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
You got to have some rules

1370
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,327
Sure now I need to know

1371
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,167
I got to have like an isolated list of

1372
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
Who can do magic

1373
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Everyone

1374
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:50,847
Everyone but I mean like what magic is real you know

1375
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,895
We got Harry Potter magic is real

1376
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,295
You said the name of the boy who lived

1377
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,231
And then we go to the Aztecs in the Middle Ages are all real like what

1378
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
Rrt

1379
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
Now let's get even weirder with it

1380
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
Any Asian religion

1381
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
Dunes Realty

1382
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Okay

1383
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
Secondary question

1384
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
If the demons

1385
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
Grant great power

1386
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
For child sacrifices in the blood of virgins and stuff

1387
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
Aztecs

1388
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
Still like

1389
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Top of the world

1390
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:32,575
They did a lot of sacrifices I think we all know how all of these

1391
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:37,695
This civilization fell somebody forgot to do the sacrifice

1392
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,535
Every human endeavor human civilization is ended like this

1393
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Actually I guess

1394
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,935
The rebuttal to that or the answer to my

1395
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
Problem is

1396
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
Alex would just say that

1397
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
The globalist have done

1398
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,615
Secretly play more sacrifice

1399
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
All the rest of these civilization itself was no longer valuable to the globalist so then they started a

1400
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,063
Different one or because abortion

1401
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
Okay all right we've talked ourselves through this

1402
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,719
Isaac

1403
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,047
Question is the Alex does believe that the rituals work

1404
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
And

1405
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,119
Things that the answer to your question is

1406
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
The anybody

1407
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,679
Can do these thing right

1408
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,215
You've got to do something

1409
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:27,103
Contact the demons first commit some horrible saying or whatever to open up the port

1410
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Porthole

1411
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
To hell or something

1412
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
Right right

1413
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Alchemy real

1414
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
Can we turn lead into gold

1415
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Probably

1416
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
I just

1417
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
You know you when you open it up

1418
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:42,719
These rituals actually summon literal demons now all bets are off

1419
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Can you throw bones

1420
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Exactly

1421
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Probably

1422
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
Disgraceful bulshit

1423
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
Melanie just lies about Kevin

1424
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
Gavin Newsom

1425
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,663
11:30 Pacific in it event today didn't show up he was

1426
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687

1427
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
But

1428
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:09,599
They say he's going to be at a vaccine clinic tomorrow in the morning so we'll see you that's

1429
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
That's true

1430
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,439
It was about vaccine clinic and he was also at the Getty wedding

1431
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
I was just making that up

1432
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
Another gas

1433
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Bad that wedding really does

1434
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,167
Cuz I was like well

1435
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
One of the

1436
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,519
Piece of evidence that he hasn't been in hiding all this time

1437
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,151
Bring that up pretty bad about that

1438
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,479
I think we can all agree that it was tasteful real problem

1439
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
It was just

1440
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,599

1442
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
Classy affair

1443
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
It's a parody of real

1444
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Okay

1445
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583

1488
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
So

1489
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
So there's

1490
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
The phrase

1491
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
Is the shots

1492
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,271
Apparently

1493
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,087
20K

1494
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
There is not been

1495
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,183
Time in my life whenever we have not been in the book

1496
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Congratulations

1497
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
Then the mark of the beast has not been on the

1498
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
The tip of everyone's

1499
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
Officially the market

1500
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
Anybody shoot

1501
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Bible

1502
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:44,895
Biocell

1503
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Alex right now

1504
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
Excitement

1505
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
Tell folks where they find your book your website

1506
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Paul Joseph Watson

1507
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:06,143
Cannot be happy about following that up man to lead the world in prayer

1508
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,679
Nepal

1509
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,239
Yeah boy

1510
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
A little bit disappointed to hear this goes for the last

1511
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
Years I've been operating on

1512
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:18,175
Something that UPC symbols worth of Mark of the Beast

1513
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,271
So many marks of the Beast which one

1514
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,599
Prefer

1515
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
In order to buy and sell you no like

1516
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
Obviously with the scanners and

1517
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Southlake

1518
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,511
In order to buy this you guys have a symbol on

1519
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
I got at least there's like alright I get where you going with us

1520
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
See I know I've always been a big

1521
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
Bigger fan of the social

1522
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,263
Security number being the mark of the beast because if you're undocumented

1523
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,335
Then you'll go buy stuff though but I mean

1524
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,895
That's why the shot is actually a fault

1525
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
Nothing here too because you can still order things

1526
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:57,599
Things to be delivered point where you can't go out in public

1527
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,671
If you are on vaccinations you can still order ship

1528
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,535
Contactless delivery still exist so

1529
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:10,911
Bible had no idea that drones would be able to deliver things

1530
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,215
Never was going to work

1531
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,007
The first bible really should have

1532
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Proceed

1533
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,823
People leaving stuff at your door

1534
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,663
Dropping things off

1535
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,479
What is Passover but the original home delivery

1536
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
Fair enough

1537
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Oh yeah

1538
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
It's like when they take away your

1539
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
Unless clip

1540
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
And it's not

1541
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
Stella Immanuel prayer

1542
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
That's

1543
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
But I don't know how well I would have done

1544
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,399
It might be one of the most

1545
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
Disgraceful things

1546
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
I've heard on Alex's show

1547
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,983
I'm excited for that

1548
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
Might be indicative of

1549
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Something

1550
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
Maybe illegal

1551
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Definitely on ethical

1552
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,271
Cialis for people that like I said everybody

1553
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,975
Open OverDrive

1554
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,535
This is a spiritual battle

1555
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
Alex

1556
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Stella has

1557
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
A promo code

1558
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,679
Promo code Alex

1559
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
For his listeners to get a dis

1560
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,799
Discount on Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine

1561
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
I don't know

1562
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
For sure

1563
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
Haha

1564
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,223
But typically whenever you have a referral program like this

1565
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
Sure you get a cut

1566
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,807
Like when I was 22 ammo code Alex

1567
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,367
Set my pillow that was because they had a

1568
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Sort of

1569
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Yeah

1570
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
So I wonder

1571
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
I-10

1572
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Some kind of a financial interest

1573
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
Stella Immanuel hydroxychloroquine

1574
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
I'll tell you that

1575
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
I don't know

1576
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
I don't know what to

1577
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
To think about this

1578
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
I know that in the past

1579
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
Alex has had like

1580
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,135
Max Keiser tried to screw Alex

1581
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:12,255
Is he at a Bitcoin kind of thing

1582
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
So you could do this

1583
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
Alex's on board with this

1584
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
It's one of the boron

1585
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Yeah yeah that one's bad

1586
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,567
Alex is promoting all of these

1587
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
Ineffective

1588
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Skewers

1589
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
And simultaneously

1590

Said ineffective

1594
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
Snake oil salesman

1595
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
Go from

1596
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Hounded

1597
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
You know they had to do all this

1598
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Is work

1599
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,791
They had to but if they is they had ever

1600
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
Dreamed of just like

1601
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
Okay

1602
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,959
All I have to do is give people a promo code and they'll just

1603
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
By this ship I don't know

1604
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,519
Even convince them

Banana

1606
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Amazing

1607
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,151
So we we reach me on here and I hope

1608
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
I don't know.

1609
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Probably invest

1610
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Navigate that

1611
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Beguiled

1612
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
That's that's unfortunate

1613
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,975
Back to Alex after this is a weird week

1614
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,767
He's gross

1615
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,607
Because those aren't those aren't supplements those are actual medications

1616
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
Do you know

1617
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,471
Real drugs you didn't pull this b******* with like

1618
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Yeah that's

1619
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
DC doesn't give a f*** about think they should

1620
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,383
Yeah right the reason that you have to go to Stella Immanuel cuz you need a

1621
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Prescription for the

1622
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
This is not good

1623
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,599
It's got to be illegal

1624
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
Heather should be

1625
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,951
Remind me to fix that

1626
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Yep

1627
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,047
Yeah so sorry about that lot of disappointing

1628
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
False prediction

1629
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,935
Gavin Gavin

1630
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,727
The governator than he's

1631
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
The gavinator

1632
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,687
So that was a bummer this Steve guy is nuts and Alex has decided
