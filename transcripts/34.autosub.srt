The hill I will die on

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,591
Speaking of which that brings us to our out of context Alex Jones quote for the day

80
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
Today's episode

81
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
Should give you a sense of where things are going to go

82
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,415
Yep that's the seriousness that we're dealing with today

83
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,767
Or I will die

84
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Current

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
Plant pants situation

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,447
I'm going to put my money more on the floor the ladder

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,663
Is this about

88
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,807
Going to get custody of his children

89
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
We are not yet

90
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
It's not about that

91
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,023
He's getting sick

92
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
He's getting Greek yogurt they have put a lawsuit

93
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Actually the amount looking for

94
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
$10,000

95
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
It's almost nothing

96
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,647
We'll get into it

97
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
We'll get into it

98
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
April 25th

99
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
I came out Tuesday of this week

100
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Alex Jones

101
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
We'll get to it

102
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Okay I'm sorry

103
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Okay nevermind

104
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
On the 25th Tuesday of this week

105
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Alex Jones came in early

106
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,039
Before he had to go to court

107
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
Cuz it's pre-taped it's not live sort of pretend that it's live

108
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
And he recorded the first hour before Paul Joseph Watson took over

109
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Or I'm sorry I think it's actually David Knight

110
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Took over Houston today

111
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,399
Regardless I didn't watch the rest but I just watched Alex's first hour

112
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Holyshit

113
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
Do do we got a winner

114
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
This stuff

115
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Is crazy

116
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Curious about this lawsuit

117
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
We'll get into all this feelings about it all of his nonsense

118
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Because it's so bad

119
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
I have to say up top

120
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
I apologize

121
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,207
They were rebroadcasting

122
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
To my Muslim friends out there

123
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
To all of the Islamic folk in the world

124
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
I am sorry that someone says these things

125
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
It's going to be very bad

126
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
I have cut out some stuff

127
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Particularly gross

128
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Cuz he makes a lot of

129
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Breitbart

130
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Claims

131
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
About crimes that immigrants

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Right there all not true some of the ones that are

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Particular

134
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
But I will say listening through this I almost threw up

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
So

136
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
I just got so overwhelmed and anxious about all the hate

137
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
How is the

138
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
I'm not sure

139
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
Cuz that demagoguery

140
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
I mean this teams

141
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
I think I do have it.

142
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
I think it's cuz he's hemorrhaging money

143
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,071
I think it's because he's bleeding money out and he knows that the end is near

144
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
David he's pulling out his most desperate moves

145
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
And

146
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
He knows the ending

147
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
On one of the only things one of the only last Trixie has in his pocket

148
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Is outright race war

149
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
So

150
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Going to start

151
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
Introduces

152
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Be lawsuit introduced the idea of the lawsuit

153
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
This is about

154
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
This lawsuit is scheduled for one fall

155
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Teen yoga

156
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,175
Shows your host

157
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
April 2017

158
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,375
Brown

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,727
In the fight for the United States

160
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
The biggest

161
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
World

162
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Bill Clinton

163
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Big

164
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,863
So this is the introduction

165
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Because we're friends

166
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
George Soros

167
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
No I mean

168
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Oh yeah

169
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,175
I mean obviously not Alex

170
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
They're coming after us

171
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
Really I don't have specific numbers on a bug Levi read that down

172
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,815
Milkers like Yoplait or CIA

173
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
I remember reading the line that they are just aching for 10,000.

174
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
Also irrelevant to

175
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
A little bit later but the point we need to realize right now is that Alex is being sued by

176
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Yogurt money is coming after him

177
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
She is furious about it

178
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
In this next clip

179
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Alex explained

180
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
And he tries to

181
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
Contextualize why he thinks this is happening

182
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Images

183
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
1020

184
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
Other mainstream

185
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Independent Media articles about Idaho

186
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
We weren't even that article

187
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Average price

188
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415

00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,287
And you have with the headline that I published fake news

191
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:34,175
Yeah yeah things were mainstream news

192
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
He was just reporting on it

193
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
Yes one of the things we need to really

194
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Deal with right up top is that he thinks the Breitbart is mainstream

195
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Because he's just referencing Breitbart

196
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,279
The only thing as rescue keeps showing either Infowars or Breitbart article

197
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
Examples of like

198
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
This is the story this is the story

199
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
The

200
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
The Chobani plant is in

201
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Twin Falls Idaho

202
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
And in that town there was a story that came out in June of last year

203
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
About

204
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Three kids

205
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Who had

206
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Attack

207
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
A young girl

208
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
In a laundry room

209
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,463
Awful awful more awful was all the lies that got spread on right-wing media

210
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
They said that they

211
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
Rapes this young girl at night

212
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Point

213
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
They had videotaped it

214
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
And shown their dad and he

215
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
He congratulated them

216
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
It was all sorts of wild twisting

217
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,871
It's all just trying to turn Islamic culture into something

218
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
It's so foreign and evil to our mine

219
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Of course

220
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
Encourage them for this Behavior.

221
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Right exactly is absolutely not true

222
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
There wasn't even a race

223
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:52,511
Metokur is okay because what happened was still bad

224
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
Brett

225
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
And he's basing a lot of his quote on quote reporting

226
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
Only came out on break bar

227
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
Now there's an article here in the Idaho Statesman which is

228
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
The paper of record

229
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
And Idaho

230
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
And they are that they have an entire story about the plea bargain

231
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
These kids

232
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
I ended up having to take

233
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Good I mean

234
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,391
They should have baby been punished harder but the oldest was 14 at the time

235
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Set a reminder

236
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,535
Alright the other thing that we have to take into consideration is that the full details of the case

237
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Or under wraps

238
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
Very specific identities are under wraps because they're all minors

239
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
In this case

240
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
You can't

241
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Publish the details

242
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
About these people

243
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
And the defense attorneys have discussed

244
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
The situation that actually happened and what happened was there was a

245
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
1410 and 7 year old boy

246
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Basically

247
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
One of them I believe the seven-year-old

248
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
I groped

249
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
A five-year-old girl

250
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
In a laundry room

251
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Gross

252
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Gross

253
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Super gross

254
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Yeah

255
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Have nothing to do with the fact that they're immigrants

256
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
No it's f***** up kid chip

257
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Seems like

258
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,175
I don't know how you make a mountain out of this I mean it's bad but it's not like

259
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Who is who is monitoring

260
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
News

261
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Right-wing blogs baby

262
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
What what I mean

263
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
They're just f****** racing around anywhere to find anything that

264
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Could even remotely be at 8

265
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,679
Well actually there's an interesting quote that I found about this

266
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
From the prosecuting attorney

267
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
Prosecutors

268
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Lobes

269
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
He said

270
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,991
Fan the Flames of anti Syrian refugee people

271
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
But suspects that false reports

272
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Are the work of a local group opposed to refugee resettlement

273
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
Go to stir up trouble by claiming the incident involves Syrian refugees who committed a violent sexual assault

274
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,607
There's a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees

275
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,679
They have not been constrained by the truth

276
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
LoveSac

277
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,567
I don't expect him to be constrained by the truth in the future

278
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Heavily publicized spread spurious rumors about it and right-wing blogs picked it up

279
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
It mean to excuse the actual truth

280
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
It is that you're making it worse

281
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Your right-wing blogs are making it worse and you're lying about the situation whole four

282
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
With the

283
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Express purpose

284
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Demonizing people

285
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Who haven't

286
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Done anything wrong

287
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
The only reason you're demonizing them

288
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Is because they're not you

289
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
And they're in a town where you wanted to be

290
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
I'm going to go out

291
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
And say that Idaho is not exactly

292
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Bastion

293
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
Multiculturalism

294
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
Words to because

295
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,767
The reason that people are so mad about it is that the Chobani plant is in

296
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Twin Falls Idaho

297
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Chobani plant

298
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
Tires people who are not always

299
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
Danzig

300
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,823
Chobani is a notable proponent of Refugee Rights

301
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
And is a heavy donator

302
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Two refugees

303
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Resettlement

304
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Okay

305
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,807
Focus Group

306
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
Now has their George Soros to fight

307
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Who actually

308
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
Is going to be linked George Soros by Alex

309
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,047
I'm glad that well of course

310
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
Prosecutor spaces between miners aren't uncommon

311
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,823
This case is being exploited by the local anti-refugee to make a political point

312
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Also

313
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,943
No syrians have been settled in Twin falls through the Idaho Refugee program

314
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,111
There been periodic website postings about hundreds of syrians coming to Idaho that have all proven

315
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
To be false in the past

316
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
And this is probably just one of those attempts to try and stir up hatred

317
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
How can you

318
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
How can you

319
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Isn't there

320
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,519
You pretend they're there a guy who works in me

321
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
And hateful

322
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Guy names

323
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
Cyrus ug Center

324
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
It breaks my heart when people in the community are divided around issues of resettling refugees

325
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Some of the stuff that Alex Jones was reporting

326
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
These

327
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Right-wing whites

328
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Also describe them

329
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
I would assume that is definitely true

330
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
That

331
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
And I'm going to use their words

332
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
I hope

333
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
That God f****** murders them

334
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Using two angels

335
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Do they try and rape those angel

336
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:10,207
Is reporting the right-wing version of the story and he was repeating things

337
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
None of them

338
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Play back on the podcast

339
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,959
Do you want it's all

340
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
Because they're in the same business

341
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,639
They're in the same business of demonizing other population

342
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Have

343
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,903
If you wanted if you little after 4 if you want to go see though

344
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Atrocities

345
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
You can find them

346
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,791
If you want to do it and I'm not

347
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
Here's how you doing

348
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
Why would you

349
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Why would you go after this

350
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
The b******* whenever you have real things that you can

351
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,295
You can make a ton of money by playing on people's fears and fears about Islam are the best

352
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,647
Your fear is super into that community so they're playing that game

353
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
That's one thing

354
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
Secondly this guy who owns

355
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Chobani

356
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,631
He is a major player in the refugee resettlement game

357
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
They're going after

358
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
Matter where he

359
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
They would try and go after

360
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Most likely

361
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
I believe that to be

362
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
Understand what he's getting in trouble for

363
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Cheetah

364
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,463
He doesn't realize he doesn't realize that he's repeating completely debunked and

365
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Dangerous clams

366
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
Where on April 11th

367
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
He released a video

368
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
The title

369
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
Idaho yogurt maker caught importing migrant rapist

370
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Literally slander

371
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
That can't be

372
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,199
Okay that was their publication that was a video they posted on their YouTube page

373
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Rant

374
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
Call April

375
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Is

376
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
Dead to rights slander

377
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Well

378
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Were they

379
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Immigrant races

380
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Rapist

381
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Rapist

382
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
No there was no right

383
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
The only crime that's actually

384
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
Involved with this situation

385
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,200
Was were they from

386
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
They're all from the same place

387
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Sam and Sarah trash

388
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Whatever

389
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Aerotek

390
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
And I've been here for a while

391
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
They are still refugees you got one part right they are migrants it is in Idaho

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,072
No

393
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,960
Was any part of that sentence

394
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
He's an Idaho yogurt

395
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
Yeah so we got one piece yes all right

396
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
The thrust of it is.

397
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
They make Greek yogurt

398
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
They don't make Idaho yogurt

399
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,904
He's not an Idaho yogurt Greek style

400
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Yogurt

401
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:30,656
So everybody's everybody's completely sucked

402
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Based on his own nuanced than bigoted journalism

403
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Tactic

404
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,152
We got so many Clips I just hope that like

405
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,016
He's trying to thread the needle and claim

406
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,088
That this guy his name is

407
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Ulukaya

408
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
He keeps calling him

409
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,096
Which is a trance

410
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,240
But also has the dangerous.

411
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
Anyway

412
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,896
He's going to now in this clip trying and thread the needle in

413
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Unclaimed

414
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Zaxby's

415
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Specific immigrant

416
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Are his fault

417
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Or somebody's fault

418
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Here we go

419
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
So that's not going to hold up in court

420
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,128
Okay doesn't really explain

421
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
And we have no

422
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
Basically make his plane is super into supporting

423
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,672
Refugee causes has a plant in that town Ergo he's responsible for the actions of

424
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Every immigrant

425
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
It's not and we'll get a little bit later and spelling it out

426
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Really unfortunate

427
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
Because it kind of implies

428
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
He should be put on trial for the guy

429
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Who went

430
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Comet Ping Pong with a gun

431
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
But we'll get to that when we get

432
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
His logic is logic is incredibly flawed

433
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
We'll get to that when we get to it

434
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
All of those words

435
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Blue in my brain I don't understand

436
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
Like now I don't even understand

437
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,184
That's all I get from that time

438
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
I think that this might be too dense

439
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
There might be too much going on and it's all lies

440
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
So it's it's crazy this next the next one

441
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
More lies

442
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
Morla fake s*** about Hamdi

443
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:49,408
Using his first name Mister ulukaya

444
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
I don't know

445
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,272
I'm going to call him Mambi I don't care you seem cool

446
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,880
$2,000 lawsuit

447
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
By the way

448
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
Local news

449
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
George Soros

450
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
Alex has a picture of a tweet

451
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Hamdi ulukaya with

452
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
George Soros

453
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Done

454
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
I seen it all now

455
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
They were sitting next to each other

456
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,472
I don't believe so

457
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Sign up we're going to catch all these

458
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Make a

459
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,224
So is Alex's playing is that like this definitively proves that the two of them are working

460
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,808
Against him Twitter pictures

461
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,624
Twitter picture is

462
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
Alex reports

463
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
From 2 years ago

464
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
And it says the caption is

465
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
It was great to refresh

466
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
George Soros

467
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
So he had met him two years ago

468
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
He didn't know him before that

469
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Basically trying

470
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,104
Claimed that the only reason Chobani is anywhere in the world is cuz of evil George Soros connection

471
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
All this crazy s*** there's a conspiracy against Alex

472
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,368
He slandered someone

473
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
In this case

474
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,744
100% title

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
Idaho yogurt maker

476
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Imports migrant rapist

477
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Is it illegal

478
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
You can't prove

479
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Can you

480
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
You don't have to in court

481
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,104
The proof is on the person who made the claim

482
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Husto f***

483
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
No

484
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
He has nothing

485
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Here's you going to lose this suitcase

486
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
So hard

487
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
And that's why you putting up this video

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
He knows

489
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
But he's going to lose

490
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
And so he's trying to pass out his chest

491
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Iran threat

492
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
And intimidate

493
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
And unfortunately

494
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
Because he's really bad at this game

495
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,192
He says a bunch of stuff that I know will be used in that eventual court case

496
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
Cuz it's like

497
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
You're going to be able to create a pattern of bigotry

498
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
In him

499
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
And they're going to be able to use that too

500
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
Insinuate or suggest that that's why he published lizard

501
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Stories to begin with

502
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,600
Wait till you hear the kind of crazy b******* that comes out of his mouth throughout the rest of this episode

503
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
For this alone possibly

504
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
No I would

505
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
It's sort of free speech

506
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Threatening I do it walks the line

507
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Anyway

508
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
It's appropriate that I'm wrestling with that big

509
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Text Cliff Alex

510
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,288

512
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968

Alex Jones

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
It's about being able to shut down

518
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
The owner

519
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
Wants me to apologize for my fake

520
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Everything

521
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Damages

522

3D World

523
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
That's petulant

524
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
Is that that's so true

525
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
That's so f****** childish

526
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
What you saying

527
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,152
People have hurt other people

528
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Is a 43 year old man

529
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
He's pretending like

530
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
You want

531
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
What a f****** baby

532
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
That's who

533
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
The whole thing is

534
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,840
This whole thing is very pathetic anyway

535
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Alex

536
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Cry-Baby

537
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,128
We're also going to get into hobo Jones

538
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
So he goes on

539
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
To spend another bulshit story

540
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Brags about how great this case is going to be

541
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,256
I have the same

542
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Warheads

543
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,824
I'll talk to my lawyers

544
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
A dream

545
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
It's a dream

546
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
It's not

547
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
But I pulled up

548
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,856
CDC statistics in 2016 1287 do tuberculosis

549
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
This provisional count

550
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
F******

551
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
Represents the lowest numbers ustv cases on record and a 2.7% decrease

552
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
2015

553
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,240
The 2016 tuberculosis incidence of 2.9 cases per 100,000 persons

554
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
Represent a slight decrease compared to 2015

555
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,640
The - 3.4%

556
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
In the Deep

557
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
So nice

558
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,576
Cool also the tuberculosis rates have been steadily declining

559
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
All over

560
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
If you ain't it like if you include

561
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
Just us born people

562
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
There's a much sharper slope downward

563
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,328
You include just immigrant populations

564
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
It's still trending downwards

565
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
But it's it's

566
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,448
It's a little slower

567
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
But it's still going down

568
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Also I pulled up

569
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
The statistics as it relates

570
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
To the specific

571
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Cities

572
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
However sorry states in the country

573
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Closest rate

574
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,064
You really can't drive parallels

575
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Between states that have high immigrant populations

576
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
Places like Texas and California are all on the decline

577
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
There is a bit of an up

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Swing in

579
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
A percentage wise in Idaho

580
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,656
But there's a about five times bigger upswing in

581
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
West Virginia

582
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
The dirty

583
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
West's minors

584
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,848
All of them under the age of

585
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,040
You really can't trace

586
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
What's a kilo

587
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Very different

588
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,208
It is

589
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,048
Migrant populations in a few are you really just trying to stretch excuses

590
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
He'll get to this later but he claims

591
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,424
Is that 7 active tuberculosis cases were sent to Idaho

592
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
I did a little digging into that is actually true

593
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
But

594
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
Here is a response

595
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
From

596
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Channel 11

597
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
In Twin Falls Idaho

598
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,552
You might have seen an article published today by breitbart.com

599
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
The article said that seven Refugee resettlement in Idaho between 2011 and 2015

600
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
7 people in 4 years

601
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,864
Epidemiologist confirm that that is true however it's not the

602
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
Complete story

603
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
TV is nothing new for Idaho

604
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Dr. Kristy Hahn

605
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
The state epidemiologist

606
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,616
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare treats people both Refugee and American every year

607
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
These particular cases are not contagious

608
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
And do not pose a threat to the public

609
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
The department typically test

610
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
Centuries refugees than 90 days of them being in state

611
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
And refugees are usually good Payson

612
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
Quote from this dr. Christine Hong

613
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
We're very active

614
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,280
And refugees are increasingly Cooperative about wanting to be immunized

615
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,632
Wanted to be putting any treatment they need and getting on their way to becoming good Idaho Center

616
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
They really are very willing and eager to be treated

617
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
They do not want to pose a risk

618
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
To anybody either

619
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Wow

620
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,384
You know what that's really really admirable that you would want

621
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:27,040
Interesting

622
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
These refugees are more responsible than Jenny McCarthy

623
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,008
Somebody followed Alex Jones kids

624
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Tvblog

625
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't do that come on man

626
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
I got them

627
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
No

628
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:02,112
Joseph middle name

629
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,976
I took the reality is that these stories are all just

630
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,816
If you do a little bit of cursory researcher all bogus they're all busted

631
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,656
Straw case

632
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
That have been for channel 11 news

633
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Twin Falls Ford

634
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,592
Oh my God real news to report

635
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,408
Thank you Jesus

636
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
His f****** kitten

637
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,904
So now we're going to get into a little bit

638
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
I specifically about Hamdi ulukaya

639
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,864
Yeah and we're going to hear some of Alex's

640
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,960
Pronunciation

641
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,848
I understand that I might not be pronouncing his last name perfectly but some of Alex's pronunciation

642
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
They border on racing

643
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:02,016
Just the pronunciation generous

644
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
You're also is

645
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
Codename the Texan

646
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
Yes they have a difficulty with foreign names

647
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
I understand that

648
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:13,280
Don't want to put any effort into respecting other people

649
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
Where are we we took most of this land from the Mexicans but ends up calling

650
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,544
Him in Islam assist which is probably not good considering that is a code word

651
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,104
I also talked more about

652
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
For Alex somebody who's actively Islamic Jihad I believe it that's Alex's sort of death

653
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
Cuz whenever there is

654
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
Terror acts carried out

655
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
So I don't know

656
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
It's bad it's bad whatever he's using it is it's making up a new word in order to pretend

657
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
And that it's a different thing

658
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:55,264
That white Muslims

659
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,872
And you like them that's fine because they're not

660
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456
So he looks like Hillary Clinton in the super predator

661
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,992
Right

662
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
He

663
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
He says this about Hamdi

664
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,928
And then he says that

665
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Yeah the new lie

666
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,536
And then gets to like his feelings of being oppressed

667
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
And this is all a big conspiracy

668
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,448
I talked to my lawyer

669
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
I understand a lot of money

670
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,592
But you got a guy from Turkey

671
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Just got here in the 90s

672
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
Runs

673
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
Is ultra Secret

674
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
Pictures of Federal Reserve George Charles Dickens better

675
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:13,856
View George Soros

676
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,208
Bill Clinton apologize

677
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
Muslims

678
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
Let's get into some fun

679
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Fun

680
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,664
Has the Ring of like a cork board with

681
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Push pins in it

682
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
Tying strings together

683
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,624
He's from Turkey

684
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
To start this Law Firm that's all nonsense and

685
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Conjecture

686
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,536
Would you like to learn more about Hamdi ulukaya

687
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,656
Alright was born to parents small sheep goat

688
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
And cheese farm in Turkey near the Euphrates River

689
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:07,872
He does not know his actual birthdate because his parents were they lived semi-pneumatic nomadic existence

690
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Because phlox

691
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
We're known to move around

692
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
And they moved with the flock and he was born when they were sorta on the road

693
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
They made awesome cheese

694
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Apparently

695
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,536
That's what they were sort of no no

696
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,312
Claims that Hamdi ulukaya showed up out of nowhere in the 90s

697
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Well

698
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
That's not fair

699
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
He's trying to create this idea of a mysterious beginning

700
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
But it's not true

701
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Is he okay

702
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:54,208
He's not in a turkey

703
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,816
1994 that he moves the United States University

704
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Then the University of Albany

705
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Restarted a little bit of business

706
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
Africology went to work on a farm upstate

707
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
His father was like a bro

708
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,848
They do do some more here how about you know we got this awesome artisanal

709
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,456
Feta cheese going on why don't you bring some of that Stateside there cheese sucks

710
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
What do you try and sell it over there

711
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
So he convinced him to do this

712
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
He started up his own little minor cheese operation

713
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
I need it for 2 years

714
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,256
But event at the end of it he was only able to really break even with a business

715
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
From the world

716
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
You know

717
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Turcotte his losses

718
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,472
Stabbed 1005 by chance

719
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,824
Hamdi ulukaya noticed an ad for a craft yogurt plant that was shutting down

720
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
His lawyers and most of the people in

721
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
Circle told him not to but he decided to buy it

722
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
And decided to start up making some yogurt

723
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
He even

724
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,928
Went so far as to rehire some of the craft employees who were laid off

725
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
After the

726
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
They went out of business

727
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
They were not

728
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
I don't know

729
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Yeah I don't know it's I think

730
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Number one

731
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
Super irrelevant

732
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
A people

733
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,968
Because of the craft Factory going down swings in

734
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
Anybody even Trump would admire

735
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
Absolutely

736
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
I know you would still hate it because

737
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
He paid them the same amount

738
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
He didn't

739
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
Oh no did he pay them less eventually

740
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Trump would hate him

741
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,192
Money on the table

742
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:45,056
Chobani is a variation of a Turkish word for Shepherd

743
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,640
That's where they at that's where the name for the company came from

744
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,200
I am in 2017

745
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:56,320
And whereas if you're small operation you would think that you would sell to boutique stores

746
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
And Specialty operations

747
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
He decided instead

748
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
The target normal grocery stores

749
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
To make his product accessible to

750
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,280
Everybody supposed to just really rich

751
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
Knowing that he couldn't afford marketing

752
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
You couldn't compete on that level

753
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,936
He made the shape of his package distinctive

754
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
You're the Chobani comes in those bowl

755
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
As opposed to like Yoplait comes in the Triangular Go-Gurt

756
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
The Squeeze

757
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,760
So he made that bowl which is distinctive and he made sure that his

758
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Packaging was bright

759
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
On top of that you set up

760
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
Frequent in-store sampling

761
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
So people could get used to this new idea this Greek yogurt

762
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,888
Cuz it wasn't popular at all at the time it's a thicker yogurt he is reasoning was that American yogurt was

763
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
Two sweet and didn't like his kind of gross

764
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
Wanted to bring back what you do growing up

765
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
Yeti putting so much f****** a

766
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
To get people on board

767
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Do used

768
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
To give to stores

769
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
The president could salad make a profit

770
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
Instead of giving the money cuz he couldn't afford it

771
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Coming up from nothing he's he's doing all the all the stuff that other people wouldn't do

772
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,071
In order that game Business movie

773
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Yes so people caught on pretty quick and they really liked is Robert cuz it's very good I don't know if you were if you enjoyed your boss

774
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
Lonnie Brooks

775
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:24,383
Not all the flavors but this is not this is not the yogurt taste

776
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:29,503
So in 2009 he starts getting carried by Costco which is acute breaks

777
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
The company basically gives them

778
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,135
They're huge windfall and makes them asses

779
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
Hundreds of thousands of cases that end up being

780
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,863
Hamdi ulukaya was not satisfied with just that he kept innovating

781
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,959
From that point on with all kinds of crazy s*** new flavors at

782
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
Desert line at this point you

783
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Working on

784
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Dip

785
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
Now yogurt dips

786
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
Drinkable yogurt

787
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
These are galaxies really innovating

788
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
But all call me when he makes

789
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,903
Things go to create jobs they all go to create jobs in terms of innovation product testing

790
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,975
All of this stuff and most of it is in that Twin Falls

791
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Idaho plants

792
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,607
Rectus really awesome to bring tons of jobs to Idaho to a place where otherwise

793
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:22,495
The open this large Plant in Twin Falls Idaho has been a tremendous boost to the local economy

794
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,335
The New York Times article in March of 2017 highlighted ulukaya

795
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:34,015
To work with colleges to offer Technical Training for workers to solve the area's labor shortage

796
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
The Chobani yogurt plant in Twin Falls

797
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,671
Is the largest in the world and pays its workers in the area on average

798
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Twice minimum wage

799
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Oh

800
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
Yeah

801
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,703
Percent of the profits the net profits every year to charitable causes

802
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,519
The offers is employees

803
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Parental

804
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
Which is something that is not legally required to do

805
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,455
He gave his employees a huge mass of shares when they went public

806
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
I want to read you his quote

807
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Because I think it's

808
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
I think it's beautiful

809
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Here so

810
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Here's the specifics of it

811
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,231
CEO and founder Hamdi ulukaya told the companies 2000

812
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,631
Full-time employees at its Upstate New York plant Tuesday they'll receive shares worth up to 10% of the company's value when

813
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
When it goes public

814
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
Or is sold

815
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
This isn't a gift

816
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,799
Ulukaya said in a letter to employees obtained by USA Today

817
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,639
It's a mutual promise to work together with a shared purpose and responsibility

818
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
To continue to create something special and of lasting value

819
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Holy f******

820
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,879
How we built this company matters to me but how we grow it matters even more

821
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
I want you to

822
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,047
I want you to not only be part of the growth I want you to be the driving force of it

823
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
At the sharing our success to be rewarded by

824
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
So this guy is

825
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,191
Literally if

826
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Capitalism

827
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
It would look like this guy

828
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
It would look exactly like this

829
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
He disapproves all of that b******* about companies would need to leave if they pay their workers more

830
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,575
All of that matters

831
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Because it's not

832
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,255
I really like this guy

833
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
He is a major donate to the Children's Aid Society of the Special Olympics is on the board of the Kennedy Center for Performing

834
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
Foundation which of the refugee program

835
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,287
Any part of the giving pledge

836
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,895
You are forgiven

837
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,199
Fortuner whatever doesn't have to be when you die

838
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
Most of your money

839
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:48,415
Is worth about 1.2 billion he's committed to giveaway over 700 million of his own money

840
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,743
To charitable causes throughout the course of his life or by the time

841
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
So

842
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
He seems

843
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Really cool

844
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah he seems like a good guy almost

845
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Listen

846
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
I am fairly certain

847
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
That if you're a white supremacist

848
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
Used million times over

849
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,575
You know what's amazing to like if you really listen to that

850
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
He is a massive

851
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,999
Success story for refugee

852
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:29,887
Interested in giving back to the community is living proof of what

853
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Can happen

854
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
If people he is the quintessential American 100%

855
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
People talk about the American dream house

856
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
The American dream

857
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
That's what people want to find like negative things

858
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
You got sued

859
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Because

860
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
Yogurt wasn't technically Greek

861
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:00,351
I really can't find too much negative stuff about it superhero ready thing like that

862
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
From everything I can find you seems really cool

863
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
Seems like the kind of business leader you would want

864
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,799
He seems to be encouraging all sorts of really

865
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:15,199
Great thanks also Alex Jones of the New York Federal Reserve

866
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Bored

867
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
And Alex Jones

868
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
Know what the New York Federal Reserve there's absolutely no

869
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,767
Something to do with the Illuminati

870
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
The f******

871
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,143
Call the Elders of Zion and this stupid anti-Semitic

872
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,567
He's claiming that first of all is a part of the New York Federal Reserve board he is not

873
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
And he never has been

874
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
No

875
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
You can but you know what he was

876
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Cialis

877
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Who ruled with an iron

878
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:06,143
Know what he was was he was a member of the upstate Regional Advisory Board of the Federal Reserve Bank

879
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
New York

880
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Which was back in

881
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
2000

882
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
13

883
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
Now the upstate

884
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
New York regional Advisory Board

885
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Do you know what they do

886
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
No the name is too boring

887
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:22,783
The board meets three times a year to provide the New York leadership with ilevel financial and economic intelligence

888
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
From an Upstate New York perspective

889
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
The board is composed

890
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
The chief executive officer and president of National and international oriented

891
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Large companies

892
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
At that are headquartered in Upstate New York

893
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
This was because at the time

894
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Headquarters in

895
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
New York

896
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
So I would assume

897
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Alex tries to pretend to the all this s***

898
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
It's f****** secretive

899
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
If you just Google it

900
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
Everybody who's on the board is listed right here in front of me

901
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
All of the

902
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
Whatever business the president CEO of

903
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:03,999
New York James P lorito president Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation in Poughkeepsie

904
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Scott Taylor

905
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
President

906
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
West Herr Automotive Group Orchard

907
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Park New York

908
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
So mean just goes on there's just all these people who are in business

909
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
And I'll explain to pretend its secretive is b*******

910
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,287
Because right below it

911
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,359
PDFs you can download of the minute but all of their meetings

912
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,735
Legitimately you can see what they were talking about it Salisbury public

913
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,855
There's nothing secretive going on here

914
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:34,207
Their agenda and presentations list and the minutes of their meeting

915
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
Are right here

916
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,559
It's literally right in front of me

917
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,167
If Nixon can turn off turn off his recording for 15 minutes

918
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Sure

919
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Maybe maybe

920
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,287
Luminous artist specific as Alex wants them to be

921
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,127
What are more specifics and Trump's read out of his phone calls

922
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
So

923
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Suck it

924
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Anyway

925
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Alex

926
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:59,807
Is trying to create this entire narrative about this really awesome

927
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:06,207
Just because I happened to be some refugees that are coming in

928
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Nuance believe in

929
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
Then Alex has

930
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,911
It's super important it's about Alex slandering someone who doesn't deserve it

931
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
And he's committing further slander in this video

932
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
And it's really unfortunate

933
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Because

934
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
You going to get sued harder

935
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,687
His putative

936
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
Another day of detention

937
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
So in this next clip

938
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,023
I feel like I've been talking too long

939
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Alex

940
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,143
I really tried

941
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,263
What's a compliment

942
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,823
I built this podcast from the ground up

943
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,431
Do Costco's on board

944
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
Get really is trying to hit hard that he knows

945
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
The hungry goat is funneling islamist

946
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
Pandora country

947
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
He goes on to

948
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,231
Really suck up his chances of winning a lawsuit

949
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
And then

950
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
Kind of indict himself for some others

951
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
I will get to it at

952
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,655
What will discuss what I mean by that at the end of this

953
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
He's really bad at the record show

954
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
A guitar mode

955
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,039
Call back anytime

956
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,927
Mustard

957
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
Will be destroyed

958
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:57,055
Chobani yogurt in the world

959
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,663
Kyogre

960
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
Grocery store

961
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,855
Call Alex thinks that he strong-armed the government basically into putting Chobani into this

962
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,647
School lunch mandatory programs

963
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
That's what an argument

964
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
But who cares

965
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Alright

966
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,351
So we're here just because

967
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
He says something really fun

968
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,215
Chobani yogurt

969
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
What did he start

970
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,319
Alex Jones Infowars

971
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,743
George Soros

972
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:58,495
We know some of the time

973
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
Pilgrim

974
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
Colonist

975
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,447
F*** you

976
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Doesn't doesn't

977
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
So

978
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,735
He's saying that because I mean Lucaya is

979
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Involved

980
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
And donate

981
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
To Refugee causes

982
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Because of these refugees,

983
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
And commit crime

984
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
He is therefore responsible for those crying

985
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,743
Now you use that logic

986
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Alex Jones

987
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
Is responsible for the man showing at the Comet Ping Pong with gun

988
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,215
Cuz he didn't record say that he was inspired by listen to Infowars

989
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,519
Further he's responsible personally

990
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
For every time

991
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:10,943
Someone harass the Sandy Hook family member responsible for all sorts of things that are illegal

992
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,063
I really don't think you should be making that argument

993
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,855
I really I really think

994
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
You have a bad lawyer

995
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
But also you're in the middle of a custody battle

996
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,487
You should not be putting this video out

997
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
I don't know what

998
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
You f*** your thinking

999
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,607
I have no idea who's letting you do this

1000
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
I think

1001
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,959
He should be wearing a

1002
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,567
Maybe he had a very good lawyer

1003
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,967
That would be happening right now or you'll just have a ball all day everyday

1004
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
The briefcase

1005
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,391
Wearing a tiny little mustaches painted on

1006
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
It's ridiculous like I don't know I can't imagine in good conscience a lawyer being like alright look

1007
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,863
We're trying to save custody of your children

1008
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Now you've been

1009
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,703
Serve as lawsuit filed against you

1010
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,007
Don't f****** blow that lawsuit

1011
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:13,407
You're going to think you're on thin ice you did slander this guy we need to pray

1012
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,807
You're f****** an hour and screams some of the most vile filled

1013
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Embolize

1014
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
That he could possibly

1015
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,183
It's like he's trying to destroy him

1016
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
It legitimately

1017
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
I can't

1018
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Many other

1019
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,327
Okay

1020
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Alright

1021
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
Here is

1022
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
Here's your secret

1023
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
That's interesting

1024
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
If he uses the insanity defense

1025
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
Which admittedly

1026
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Is

1027
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,479
Not usable in civil court

1028
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
Reply to like long-drawn-out behaviors

1029
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:02,047
So far lasted for twenty years on the air

1030
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,447
This next cookie gets back to that maybe this is maybe you do

1031
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,287
Cuz then you can really hang on your performance

1032
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,383
Right here what kind of insane person

1033
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Wood

1034
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,015
Unless person was a committed performance

1035
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Actually

1036
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,743
Committed in a way that otherwise people wouldn't like being all apologetic

1037
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:40,959
Let your Siri sit and marinate because there's a lot more to get through and you might change your tune

1038
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,359
Is he gets back to that sexual assault case that we discussed already and keep in mind at any time

1039
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,151
Brings up a headline is Breitbart article

1040
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,967
So keep that in mind most of them

1041
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
Thoroughly debunked

1042
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
What's media

1043
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
Confirm

1044
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,127
Literally found the first one

1045
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,431
None of that is true

1046
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,991
That's true they didn't plead guilty to rape

1047
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
And all of those

1048
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
Details the videotaping all that stuff is

1049
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
It is just from Breitbart

1050
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
There was one of the kids

1051
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
Allegedly did videotape

1052
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
The groping

1053
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,559
The assault

1054
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,839
It was

1055
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,119
No sexual

1056
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Contact

1057
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
But no penetration or anything like that

1058
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,543
Doesn't make it better

1059
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Isn't

1060
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
Alex is literally lying

1061
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
Yes so

1062
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,551
This media firm PR thing is not founded by George Soros

1063
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
Course not it's called economedia

1064
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
Can the

1065
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
I could be a kangaroo

1066
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
We're going to do with that but

1067
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
Alex narrative

1068
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
It's going to go through the next 3 clip

1069
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
Which is what do you think

1070
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
Is the plan for censorship

1071
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
And the first part

1072
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Phase 1

1073
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,031
Alright

1074
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:25,151
I'm a big fan of phasers

1075
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:29,503
I'm a big fan of the superpower phasing

1076
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,111
Yep phasing through doors and s***

1077
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
It is already happened

1078
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
Effects

1079
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
Everybody

1080
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,431
Santa Cruz radio host

1081
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
Everywhere is playing

1082
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,767
Fraud

1083
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,423
Play habit

1084
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
It's your lawyer

1085
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,335
That's what I'm

1086
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Comedy

1087
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
That's phase one

1088
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,599
All started with his water

1089
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:44,255
Who is good friends with

1090
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,351
Who was on The Advisory Board

1091
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,935
State New York Federal Reserve stop

1092
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,495
Bill Clinton

1093
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
Do you know what happened to their

1094
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
He was

1095
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
The man who put

1096
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:06,015
His lawyer through law school he's called in that favor

1097
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,159
So

1098
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
He has donated to the Clinton Foundation but one of the only things that I could really find

1099
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,375
I was a concrete thing of his involvement with them

1100
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,655
Little speech you gave on

1101
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,447
September 29th 2015

1102
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,007
He spoke at the Clinton Global initiative in New York

1103
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
Do more than just write checks

1104
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
To help alleviate the suffering of the display

1105
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Okay

1106
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,063
Sinister

1107
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,599
Underground Railroad

1108
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
That's why we built an underground tunnel from

1109
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,047
Idaho.

1110
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,839
The channel it is

1111
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
Play Islamic Channel

1112
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Yes

1113
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,287
Everybody brands

1114
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,383
Alex

1115
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
You needed that you're so

1116
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,015
Sears Phase 2

1117
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,599
And this is where Alex I think

1118
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,927
Is telling some truth lying about

1119
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,023
Natural out what's true and what's not

1120
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
We call we got a letter

1121
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:42,015
We can get away get away with it

1122
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:57,119
What's your point out that has been forced to admit

1123
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,447
Idaho

1124
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
Turned out

1125
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,847
Pharmacist

1126
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,295
Oh what are they going to do is that phase 3

1127
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
I thought we didn't face to face

1128
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,743
Tourism threatening a lawsuit

1129
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,559
But what they did I believe

1130
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,399
From all the information I can tell from knowing Alex like I do

1131
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
They sent him a message

1132
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,751
Much like James Oliphant is dead

1133
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
You can't stay this s***

1134
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
You can't

1135
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,663
We're having article opposite says Idaho yogurt maker Imports

1136
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,943
Migrant rapist

1137
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,991
That yes you can't do that

1138
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,319
So what Alex Jones.

1139
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
Which he thinks is a retraction

1140
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,951
Is he changed the headline and left the video up

1141
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,279
That's not a retraction

1142
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,607
So they they

1143
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,191
They were unsatisfied by that pissant

1144
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,543
Because what a real retraction would be is him coming on there and saying

1145
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,383
We went a little bit too far we're sorry about that this is

1146
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
You know we make mistakes sometimes

1147
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:22,111
Is what they do when they make mistakes when they make mistakes

1148
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
They go on

1149
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Sometimes

1150
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Everybody makes

1151
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:33,119
Nobody is more front than Alex Jones when he makes a mistake

1152
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
Go down there anywhere

1153
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
So we can only assume

1154
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,031
He's still a lot of headlines in the past

1155
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:44,127
Basically what I'm getting Coronavirus

1156
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Sunnyway

1157
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,063
Yeah it's coming up again Phase 2 was a letter

1158
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,439
Reborns

1159
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
Could have been

1160
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
The history also could rolled up

1161
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,703
The Iowa State or the Idaho Statesman

1162
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,519
The local paper is in on it

1163
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,543
What do they do

1164
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,359
So

1165
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,223
Extremely informative

1166
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
First I have a photo of myself

1167
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
Last year

1168
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
Escorted by police

1169
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,799
Just left it up there to make it look like I was being arrested

1170
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,767
Imports

1171
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
Yes you said all three of us things

1172
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
Literally

1173
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,887
All three of those things

1174
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,959
Things are true we showed on the last episode the Sandy Hook

1175
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Right though

1176
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
He has made those claims

1177
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
About 11

1178
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
And

1179
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
He a hundred percent

1180
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Betty

1181
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,991
He said all of us

1182
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:29,087
So you're in trouble Alex

1183
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:29,855
Big trouble

1184
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,167
A I didn't respond

1185
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,383
Blue Links there

1186
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
Backup backup

1187
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,551
Riveting television

1188
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,791
That's not

1189
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
That's not our YouTube channel

1190
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,887
They got a copy of it

1191
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,799
Where's the original

1192
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Headline

1193
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,279
Alex thinks he knows the law

1194
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:46,399
And maybe that is the case but he didn't do the headlines

1195
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,959
I don't believe he knows what statutorily

1196
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
Keep did just straight-up say that

1197
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
These links

1198
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,455
Show the original headline

1199
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Yes

1200
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:04,831
So we know that the original headlines were those horrible inflammatory

1201
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Slanderous thing

1202
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,415
So you can't even say like

1203
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
They're just making up stuff

1204
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
These guys

1205
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
Thursday and what we'd originally

1206
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Alex tries to play like

1207
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
Chobani

1208
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Attack Chobani

1209
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
Robbie cancer

1210
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:36,063
WWE style promo

1211
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,391
Or he's really getting his

1212
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,951
Horny are we getting some energy going

1213
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:46,559
And also I would like to say that in his discussion of why would I attack your body

1214
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
He shows his car

1215
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,215
At this point he can't not do it

1216
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,751
But when I when I said

1217
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,847
Because he's a Muslim I'm basing that on everything I know about Alex and what he's about

1218
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
Enjoy

1219
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
United States

1220
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
People working

1221
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,791
Goodbye

1222
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
Ado About

1223
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,679
Muslim holiday

1224
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
How could you destroy that don't you

1225
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
You have chosen

1226
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
Let's go

1227
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,231
What's up let's do it

1228
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Everybody

1229
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,583
We're going

1230
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
2

1231
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:05,663
So he goes on to start making

1232
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
Some f****** c***

1233
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,503
Rittenour at 10

1234
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:15,903
The best I can in this next Federal Reserve connection

1235
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,975
You talked more about how he appeared out of nowhere

1236
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
Beard in the nineties

1237
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:25,119
Because he was a college student in Ankara and came here

1238
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
To go to college

1239
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
He transfer colleges

1240
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,823
What other f****** business would it their beef to have important records about him before that

1241
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
I don't know

1242
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:44,063
I don't know how else could he amassed so much wealth

1243
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
Jim

1244
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:50,207
Do himself especially ironic self-serving gin

1245
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:54,303
Yes

1246
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
Problem

1247
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:01,215
It's all just a trap

1248
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
Mysterious

1249
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
Which is code for Muslim

1250
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
He is real

1251
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,687
He's involved with George Soros which we can't really prove

1252
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:17,087
Outside of this one picture from Twitter and the fact that they're both interested in humanitarian causes

1253
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
The Federal Reserve again is this

1254
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,207
Anti sematic bathing

1255
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
Yeah trying to use that is dog whistling

1256
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,047
The people who were like

1257
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,607
S*** all that evil Illuminati stuff

1258
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
He was involved

1259
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Someone who advise

1260
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
On business issues

1261
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
In Upstate New York

1262
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
4 years ago which if you're looking at the Twitter picture timeline we know that two years ago is when he met George

1263
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:46,271
Zoro for the first time before that

1264
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,111
Obviously

1265
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,671
Why can't his relationship to George Soros

1266
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,439
Beer

1267
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,231
Retroactively change

1268
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
H22 years ago

1269
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,303
Also frustrating because it's like

1270
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,095
What if everything is different

1271
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
I don't know

1272
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,423
Yeah what if everything is different I don't know

1273
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
What happened in October

1274
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,335
We would never know

1275
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:22,623
No we just all believed until we are we do tonight

1276
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
At this point Alex Jones is not even

1277
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,047
We're not dealing with our stupid evil continue nope

1278
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
Nowhere nerd

1279
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:36,959
F*****'-a Lisa

1280
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
Hirsute

1281
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:46,175
Straight to evil pretty quick we're going to have Alex believes is the mainstream media

1282
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
Media strategy to take him down

1283
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Which is interesting

1284
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
How many phases

1285
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
There's only one

1286
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
Victory from the jaws of defeat

1287
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:30,463
Idaho

1288
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,839
Muslim population

1289
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:50,943
You don't know

1290
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,343
Your coward Alex most power guy

1291
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
Listen

1292
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
A little charisma

1293
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
You're going to be you're going to be better off if David night goes down

1294
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,239
Sure but also without here is my question

1295
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
He does bring up one

1296
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
That I am in

1297
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,871
I'd love to hear about it

1298
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,639
Create these

1299
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:27,807
Cuz we not cuz you said we didn't create them push that push them but did he create

1300
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,903
Can I answer that in a slightly dismissive way

1301
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Who cares

1302
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Because that's not what he's getting sued for

1303
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,279
Okay he's getting sued for slander

1304
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Right

1305
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,679
Can you then claim that it's a

1306
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,263
Breitbart it right that headline

1307
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
Didn't create the content

1308
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,663
Breitbart to

1309
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
They should

1310
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
I imagine that my in the word bright

1311
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
I don't know

1312
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:03,903
There's also being assholes before complications

1313
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:10,815
Yeah he's in the site yeah that's true but it seems like

1314
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,935
Not a lot going on this is going to get really really really really really f***** up

1315
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:21,823
Just a couple quick let's do it

1316
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,103
Actually

1317
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Starts

1318
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Right now

1319
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,199
This next clip

1320
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,343
ESPN

1321
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
And now

1322
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,183
We're going to show you two hours of a man break

1323
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
King his leg horrible

1324
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,023
Start

1325
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
Now this is

1326
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
Bucked up

1327
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,423
This the rest of this is basically breakdown

1328
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,703
He's losing his mind

1329
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:54,079
It starts with him talking about how evil the Idaho Statesman newspaper is

1330
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
Flips onto

1331
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,919
Pictures of the Idaho

1332
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
He says I just want to say this but he's about to he says to look at it and it was like it was

1333
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,415
Islamabad

1334
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,583
Just like he said he was really

1335
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,935
Bigoted schematics

1336
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,287
So you talk s*** on the paper

1337
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
And then

1338
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,431
I want like I'll give you the high sign and that means don't say anything because

1339
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,223
Throws to break

1340
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
The harshest I've ever heard

1341
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,367
Dark ocean it's real dark

1342
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,375
Islamabad

1343
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:52,447
It's like

1344
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,847
Article

1345
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:05,503
I mean he almost caters to Muslims

1346
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:11,903
Almost accidentally said population

1347
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Muslim

1348
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:18,047
Yeah

1349
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
Anyway

1350
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,423
So

1351
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
If you look at

1352
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:30,847
Their paper a lot of it is because there is a large Muslim population there

1353
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,151
Arab population there not enough

1354
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
So

1355
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:40,063
The fact that they have stories better about their issues makes sense because it's relevant to the leadership of the paper

1356
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,599
Yeah so f*** you Alex

1357
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,159
Trying to make some sort of weird nonsense out of nothing

1358
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
He's punching down on the

1359
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Idahosa

1360
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,767
And the population

1361
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,583
The Islamic people in Idaho

1362
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,143
I mean it's about punching

1363
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,471
He's punching

1364
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,031
Down from your Ivory Tower of Lies

1365
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,079
Yeah that's

1366
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
To me because

1367
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,943
Thing is before use

1368
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,479
Nationalized

1369
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,087
He's got his boy in the White House

1370
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:19,743
A lot of popularity from being the Trump guy

1371
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
My contention

1372
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,143
Now that he's the truck guy

1373
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,727
He should go after

1374
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:36,895
I think he's punching down Soros out

1375
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:40,735
Or something like that I think that's what he thinks he's doing the worst

1376
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:47,135
I think that's what it is psychotic mind he thinks but the media lying and then

1377
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
Crazy break

1378
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,655

1382
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:25,279
Everybody

1383
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,007
Big big deal

1384
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:47,295
Bike World

1385
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,903
Hedda basically you're taking over our society

1386
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,743
That's a hard the hard brake

1387
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,839
You know you know when he's in the middle of a conversation

1388
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,631
If you're going to drop

1389
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:07,519
The Islamic people are taking over society and they bought off our governments and you don't want to prove it

1390
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,871
You just want to throw to break and then not get back

1391
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
So you just

1392
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:18,271
Rosetta ether just like hey they're killing all of us taking over but the Brotherhood

1393
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
Sharia law

1394
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:26,463
Specific

1395
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,839
It's because the people who already agreed don't need proof and you don't have proof

1396
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
Convince anyone was

1397
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
Skeptical

1398
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
So what's the point of giving birth

1399
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,959
It doesn't matter

1400
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:43,359
Lose lose game for you to try and provide proof

1401
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,175
Because it's a if he starts

1402
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Actually retracting

1403
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:53,343
With the pizza gate thing we all saw everybody saw it and everybody went

1404
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:58,207
Just like that because the moment

1405
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,743
It's it all crumbles

1406
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,119
Who else is going to come after

1407
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:11,775
How many more how many more letters do you apologize to them

1408
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,360
This Landorus

1409
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,408
He doesn't win this lawsuit

1410
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,712
How many other goddamn

1411
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
Is he coming out that's

1412
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:27,136
Exactly what's about to happen that's why he's so desperate

1413
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:33,536
This is where is Alamo

1414
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:39,936
Red blend wine

1415
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,032
He does not get back to it and prove that islamists are taking over our society

1416
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
Whatever

1417
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,616
He comes back from break

1418
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,688
Jesus some news

1419
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,736
North Korea going to Nuke us

1420
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,064
He basically just

1421
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,416
Sort of acts like he didn't do anything wrong

1422
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
And he was being magnanimous

1423
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,024
By giving the change of headline

1424
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,584
Which I guess is kind of what he has to believe in order for this

1425
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
Anyway

1426
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
This next clip

1427
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Alex gets mad at

1428
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
To comment

1429
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,080
F****** Christ and then

1430
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,616
Then he starts ranting

1431
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,640
And declares

1432
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,176
He's going to Idaho

1433
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,248

01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,648
Does Mike cernovich

1488
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
Actually work

1489
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952
Infowars

1490
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,768
Okay

1491
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Is going to be fun

1492
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:03,936
I know he's in trouble for some other stuff

1493
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,776
I would probably

1494
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,824
No

1495
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,128
Because you ended this point

1496
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:19,040
Distancing yourself from Alex's or encouraging him to do things that will destroy

1497
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
He's Young

1498
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
He could be the air

1499
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,392
If Alex Jones

1500
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,440
Goes away there's a there's a vacuum

1501
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,512
4

1502
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,560
Horrifying man to scream

1503
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,192
Anti-muslim bulshit forgotten actually when we discussed him on past episode forgotten he was also involved in

1504
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
In the gamergate

1505
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:42,848
I forgot to do something around back then

1506
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,920
I think you've already said that about him and I

1507
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,992
This is really more to

1508
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:52,064
To the point what's going on I think Alex knows he's going to lose this

1509
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,648
Bleeding money really hard

1510
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,952
If you have a hot product

1511
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
It's going to sell out

1512
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:04,352
You also don't have an Easter sale that goes on a week

1513
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,376
Can a half after Easter

1514
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
And then you don't

1515
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,216
Yeah so I mean like

1516
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
He's not moved

1517
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,800
She's not moving product

1518
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
You need

1519
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Costello This

1520
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
S***

1521
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
Yeah

1522
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,504
I really think this is what it's about

1523
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
He's got to go

1524
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
You got to get as much

1525
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:26,368
Revenues

1526
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
It doesn't matter

1527
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
Whether or not

1528
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
Prophet prophet

1529
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
It got to happen

1530
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:38,144
Yeah he needs is much money as he can get right now

1531
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,240
Plug ugly it is

1532
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,568
Do you have to pay a lot of it away

1533
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,128
Product

1534
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,432
Know that money is going to

1535
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:54,784
Give it to charity

1536
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,904
That might be the best choice products

1537
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,792
Indirectly

1538
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,376
Through the courts

1539
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,912
That'll be the case

1540
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,704
Anyway this next clip

1541
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,008
He gives a really really bad synops

1542
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
So the situation in the lawsuit that he's

1543
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
He blame

1544
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,152
Hamdi ulukaya for the situation

1545
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
And then

1546
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
You'll see

1547
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,528
Real weird

1548
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,064
Alex loses the thread

1549
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,208
George Soros

1550
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,288
Of course he's really loose

1551
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,896
She's working with him in terms of Refuge

1552
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:56,480
Tg7 Peter Sutherland

1553
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,552
Peter Sutherland a little bit later and I don't

1554
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
And the Archimedes principle

1555
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,512
Moral responsibility

1556
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
Yeah

1557
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,120
People getting murdered by their own

1558
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
Horribly

1559
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,680
In men's

1560
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,728
Just tragic ways

1561
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
And constant

1562
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
And they want to escape

1563
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,824
Then it is your

1564
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
Moral

1565
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,688
To do everything you can to help I promise we'll get to that in a minute in Morty

1566
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,992
But I wanted

1567
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,832
Because if we're not going to take it

1568
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
Twisted Sisters playing

1569
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:41,024
He was karaoke in with it

1570
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,864
Do you think do you think

1571
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,264
They do that without his knowledge karaoke

1572
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,592
In the first place I have no idea cuz it's cuz

1573
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,896
Pre-recorded it's

1574
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,712
He's screaming like that

1575
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,760
It's amazing

1576
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Anyway back to the B

1577
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:07,904
Europe

1578
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,392
The fact that

1579
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,616
Hillary Clinton lose the election

1580
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,016
With the ogre because the few times I've eaten it taste

1581
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:09,088
Recover

1582
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:13,696
And yours

1583
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:26,496
If you're not coming

1584
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,800
I looked up the Starbucks

1585
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
Stock

1586
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
It is up

1587
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128
Today

1588
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,664
Cuz almost 1% up

1589
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,992
And if you look at it on a 1-year basis

1590
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,528
It is up

1591
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,088
Really high from where it was about a year ago

1592
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,136
You look at it on just a month base

1593
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
It's up almost

1594
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,720
Let's see you're almost five points

1595
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,280
Really well X

1596
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,304
It's a pretty

1597
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,680
Consistently you look at it no matter no matter what how you look at it there's a there's an upward trajectory

1598
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,752
So your whole argument that people are sick of

1599
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
People hiring

1600
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,872
Refugees in the water that's absolutely absurd

1601
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,896
Yeah but that's the old

1602
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,664
Alternate reality

1603
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:09,504
The right-wing protects don't back it up

1604
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,296
It don't matter

1605
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,320
The reality that

1606
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
Is that there is

1607
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,904
A United

1608
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Front

1609
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Against them

1610
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,744
And if there's more of us than there are

1611
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,792
Them exactly

1612
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:25,632
Allow themselves to accept

1613
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
For once a

1614
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,448
That most people

1615
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,984
Bar

1616
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,264
Pretty cool

1617
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
That or in the middle

1618
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,848
Then they would have to re-evaluate

1619
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Literally

1620
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
Every position

1621
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:41,504
They have parcel of it have to be business

1622
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
Yeah

1623
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,856
Because that also ties into something other narrative

1624
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,720
Absolute

1625
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
Success story

1626
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:58,144
He's doing well he's doing great Starbucks stock is doing well they did hire a bunch of refugees but you know what they also

1627
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
So hired a bunch of that

1628
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,704
Initiative

1629
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,496
To hire a lot of people who are in need of

1630
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,288
I've work so I mean

1631
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,920
Soot all over the place

1632
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,456
You're going after

1633
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Genuinely

1634
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
Yeah

1635
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
For all of his

1636
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
These are genuinely

1637
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
Christian Acts

1638
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,768
I would say so

1639
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
Just every

1640
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
F****** reading of the new test

1641
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
Estimate that I can play

1642
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,168
Put together

1643
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,520
I'm basically going by

1644
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
Luke

1645
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
I got the rest of the gospels are also kind of bulshit to

1646
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,504
Neither here nor there

1647
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
6 vets

1648
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
Exactly what's going on

1649
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
Charity

1650
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
Like these veterans

1651
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
Yeah they want to be part of this

1652
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,096
Country

1653
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
Charity Stillwater

1654
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
If they want to

1655
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
Good

1656
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,312
That isn't that they wanted Alex claims they don't want

1657
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
Beat f****** whites

1658
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,664
Don't

1659
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,968
Want to be part of this

1660
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,296
They want to be part of their own, they want to be part of white

1661
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
Exactly

1662
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,672
You use nobody

1663
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,440
Nobody

1664
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
Hates America

1665
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,792
They hate it

1666
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,584
Yep really do

1667
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,608
Big time

1668
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,376
Like

1669
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:40,288
The Muslim societies that they espouse hatred

1670
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,128
If the Muslim societies just said oh and

1671
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,712
It was all white Christian

1672
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
Exactly the same.

1673
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:53,088
Exactly what they would be happy

1674
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
You know what you guys

1675
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,440
You guys don't have some bad ideas on this whole controlling

1676
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,744
I'm not a big fan of that have an agent

1677
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,912
We have some Middle Ground here

1678
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,240
Skip this next clip cuz it's just

1679
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,008
Alex Jones

1680
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:13,056
More lying about the situation he's in

1681
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,336
Pumping is stressed out

1682
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:18,432
He brings up that whole Jennifer Lopez you should go to Somali and get raped

1683
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
Situation

1684
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,248
Our Heroes

1685
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,016
That's her

1686
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,552
Don't be fooled by the rocks

1687
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,648
He goes on and I have to stress

1688
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:33,536
I have to stress again because next week I'm going to play is minutes

1689
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,072
Name that YouTube, too

1690
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,984
There's nothing I love more than I love more than whatever these guys have to go

1691
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,776
Like a Twitter handle

1692
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:50,944
Bone broth 60w tram

1693
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,272
Twitter handle

1694
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,552
Are we

1695
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,600
Like I like Twitter

1696
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
But

1697
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,672
Everytime I hear like

1698
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
Tweeted this morning

1699
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
I want to die a little bit

1700
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,840
Knowledge underscore fight

1701
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,656
Kinda this next week

1702
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,424
Like I said

1703
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,752
Is only a couple minutes after the last salesman

1704
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:18,080
Because he's about to do even more pathetic sale

1705
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
This is gross

1706
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,408
Really trying to get

1707
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,984
Calm your family needs high-quality gravity-fed filter stainless steel sits on the counter

1708
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:50,336
Your family need

1709
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,272
Purchase our products

1710
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,184
The funding

1711
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
I really don't think you could

1712
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,888
The scope is lost

1713
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912
Deposition

1714
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:19,520
Also I think I think he's not using the word depose in the way that the word depose

1715
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:24,384
Like

1716
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
And this is the

1717
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:31,040
Court deposition like he doesn't get the difference in role-play it out

1718
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:36,928
Entirely like Alex Jones in court.

1719
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,584
If he gets into that courtroom and it's a slander trial basically or defamation trial

1720
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
And they're like

1721
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,912
Alex Jones on the

1722
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:50,240
Irrelevant

1723
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
Okay

1724
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,152
I hold you in contempt

1725
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,456
How old in contempt of court

1726
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,272
So quick has already been

1727
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,832
You're not going to talk about that

1728
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:05,856
Not a business

1729
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:12,256
This court case is our business talking about it all day long

1730
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
Years back

1731
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Just f******

1732
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:31,712
With the custody thing we don't know the details we don't know what caused it we don't know that the ex-wife at all we don't know

1733
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,992
And the kids

1734
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,016
It's a tragic

1735
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,040
Sympathetic situation

1736
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,088
In this case we know the details

1737
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,160
He deserves this

1738
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,696
Damn he's going down

1739
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
Anyway

1740
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,256
Let's get to the part where he plugs

1741
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,792
Open most sad way again

1742
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,584
Minutes after the last

1743
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,984
Mama

1744
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,312
We will stand up and fight

1745
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:16,768
Your Love

1746
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,608
More fun than we ever have for this time of year

1747
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,984
And so we need to really increase

1748
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Silver

1749
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:49,280
Vitamin B12 or liver Shield Oxycontin

1750
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:55,680
Dot-com

1751
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,008
BioLife Bubblegum

1752
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,312
And we are all in this together

1753
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,848
Barbie

1754
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,384
You got to stand up

1755
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Change the world

1756
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:25,120
No.

1757
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,752
I sadly kind of agree with him but I'm

1758
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
Before it

1759
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,056
National

1760
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,080
Ilysm is rising

1761
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:38,944
I was starting to think about the other day that released

1762
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
Kind of stuck in my craw

1763
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,784
And your disk

1764
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,368
It seems really weird that people like

1765
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,928
A lot of Donald Trump's Associates

1766
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,464
Emeryville pain

1767
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,512
Putin

1768
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,304
And bronchitis

1769
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
Really connected

1770
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,656
They seem to at the very least

1771
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
Strongly support each other

1772
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,056
Which is not really what nationalistic movements would do

1773
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,896
They would not be all that concerned with International affairs

1774
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,712
Baby really concerned with nationalism

1775
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:18,112
Kind of makes you think they seem like there is a way

1776
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:22,208
White Christian supremacist operation going on globally

1777
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah I don't know

1778
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:31,424
It's stuck in my craw nationalistic that have no skin in the game in France is Alexa

1779
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,728
Yeah absolutely I guess I just

1780
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Only

1781
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,128
What what's the what's the

1782
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,176
What's the endgame for

1783
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
White Maxima

1784
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,040
I think it's probably

1785
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
Nuking countries in the Middle East

1786
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,904
I think it's probably Mass Slaughter of Arabs

1787
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,952
But I mean

1788
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,256
It really does seem like everybody's

1789
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,536
England for the holy war

1790
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
Yeah

1791
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,584
Nnh

1792
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
Exactly

1793
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:05,216
Isis is angling for the holy war these people are

1794
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,752
Like well

1795
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:11,360
You've you want to holy water then we're going to give you a holy war and there's because of that

1796
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
Because Bates

1797
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,664
Christianity suicide

1798
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,064
Alarm for the hardcore religions

1799
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,392
Islam or Christianity

1800
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,976
Impulse that's embedded in

1801
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:32,352
Fanatical religion as a whole like I mean there are Ultra Zionist

1802
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,424
Within Judaism bright like it sits Within

1803
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,496
And it's not

1804
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,336
Israel while understandable is still committing

1805
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,712
And none of that is necessarily the religions

1806
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
Location of it

1807
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:52,576
Whidbey yeah

1808
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
It's the

1809
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,416
The coop

1810
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,256
By the very elements

1811
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,024
Set the religion

1812
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
Itself with

1813
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,328
Basically started

1814
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
To come back

1815
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:09,984
Like the idea of people using a system that was intended for good but it's also assist

1816
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,288
Control what call yourself a Christian

1817
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,616
But in the side of

1818
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,640
Jesus versus

1819
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,408
The Pharisees

1820
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,224
You're on the Pharisee side

1821
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,272
If you're if you're a republican that's

1822
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,040
What's the same s***

1823
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,928
And this is why we need a Jesus

1824
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Because

1825
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,024
And for them it was they were that they were the

1826
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,304
Judaic

1827
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,168
I might be being sacrilegious with my understanding of religion and Jesus

1828
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,728
But one of the things that

1829
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,752
This is really

1830
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,288
Into was that I'm not that much

1831
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Something you

1832
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,104
I don't understand he's the son of God

1833
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Yeah but

1834
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,944
That was kind of a metaphor

1835
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,224
Central synagogue

1836
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,760
6000 years old Earth

1837
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,600
Jesus I did say a lot of

1838
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:01,952
Jesus did say a lot of things like everything I do you will do to those sorts of

1839
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:05,792
If you really want to do this exist in the world that is within you

1840
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,328
Go ahead

1841
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
Bee Gees

1842
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:13,728
Should be pretending you're the Son of God literally

1843
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:18,848
There's a lot of things with Jesus

1844
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
You can be a cool dude

1845
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:26,784
Yeah

1846
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,368
No I have plenty of experience

1847
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
Do not start a cult

1848
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,952
Scouts

1849
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Jordan look

1850
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Come out again

1851
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,536
Yep official I have a lot of

1852
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,816
Very strong stance

1853
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:40,608
Alex Jones

1854
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,936
Just got done with it what if is very sad sale

1855
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,960
And now

1856
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,240
This next clip

1857
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
I requested

1858
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
We say nothing over it

1859
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,592
I think everyone needs to hear it because

1860
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
Is

1861
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Damning

1862
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,712
It's really bad

1863
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,736
It starts

1864
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,528
Without right paranoia

1865
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,832
It's just something else

1866
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
And then there's a

1867
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,392
Complete breakdown

1868
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,928
And then he starts purring

1869
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,000
Okay it's a wild ride

1870
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,024
Would you

1871
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,328
Would you say that

1872
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,120
It's okay

1873
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,448
This

1874
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
Is

1875
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,496
Razee

1876
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:23,360
This is how he finishes his report

1877
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,408
But it goes into

1878
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:28,480
A special report that we're also going to be covering

1879
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
But

1880
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
Because it's the same topic

1881
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,112
But I've cut out the parts

1882
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:39,232
Of the special report that are just rested

1883
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,304
To play some of the stuff from the Special Report because

1884
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,120
Horrible I will be silent

1885
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
Here we go you know what's

1886
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
Going to happen

1887
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
To Alex

1888
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,336
They're failing all these attacks

1889
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
This is what they do before they kill you

1890
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,048
Systems

1891
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,640
Blind

1892
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
Other news sites

1893
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,456
Everybody else out there

1894
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:37,856
Supportive

1895
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,304
I need your help Yelp

1896
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:17,280
Because even though we've seen a record support

1897
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:23,680
In the face of all this and I want to expand I don't want to

1898
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:39,040
AAA 2539

1899
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,344
As well

1900
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:56,192
Pictures of every week

1901
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,296
Football coaches

1902
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:15,136
What is talking about

1903
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,912
We've already we've already seen him talk about how

1904
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:33,312
Sports are actually draining men of their their Tomatoes vitality

1905
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,176
FedEx

1906
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:41,248
Let's use this clip cuz it's so f***** up

1907
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,576
I feel now I feel

1908
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,368
Superhit hypocritical

1909
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
If Eddie but like

1910
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928

Don't donate to

1912
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,376
Just don't donate to our podcast

1913
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,168
Just

01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:00,960
Bye

1915
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
From us

1916
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:08,384
No.

1917
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:13,760
Play Infowars t-shirts about going to refugees eventually

1918
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,528
And guess what

1919
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:18,624
Woodmore Infowars t-shirt off the street

1920
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,488
I'm telling you he's in the middle of a breakdown

1921
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,048
It's probably fake

1922
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:36,032
Football coach

1923
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:59,328
Please help me be strong

1924
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,544
So you missed it cuz you're yelling over it but he claims that there's Muslims following

1925
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
Everywhere

1926
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,848
And it's a goddamn cult

1927
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
Yeah there are Muslim

1928
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,968
Crowd stalking

1929
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:17,760
No

1930
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,296
It's a mental illness

1931
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,880
Basically I believe that

1932
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,648
Strangers

1933
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,696
Or actually connected with each other

1934
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,232
And they're all following you

1935
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:33,632
And the keeping up on keeping tabs on you paranoid schizophrenia

1936
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,704
Trout stocking is phenomenon

1937
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,728
Is super interesting

1938
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,520
Because people believe

1939
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,312
That's all I can

1940
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,104
Get huge groups

1941
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,384
People to

1942
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
It's it's

1943
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,176
To follow you

1944
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:49,504
Keep tabs on you only attentive it is to drive you crazy

1945
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,088
Do you think

1946
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,112
That the intent

1947
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
Underwriting

1948
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,720
Is

1949
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,256
A lot of these

1950
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,536
Psychotic break

1951
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,096
Smell I think he's probably seeing a couple of Muslims

1952
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:09,728
And there are probably some reporters following him around because literally anybody with a head job

1953
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:16,384
Probably has them reporters that he sees regularly because they're at the court

1954
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,272
Is custody trial because he's dumb he's conflate

1955
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,808
That's my bestie

1956
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,368
Does not Merit

1957
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
You claiming

1958
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,440
The ball Islam is a cult

1959
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,720
Imn

1960
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,768
Praying that people give you more money

1961
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,840
Also I love I love that final prayer

1962
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,424
Christ please let our listeners on

1963
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:42,240
It's serious for him

1964
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,008
That

1965
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:43,776
That's fine

1966
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,080
That's why he keeps

1967
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,920
If I lose its a free-speech laws

1968
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:01,440
Do anything do anything for anybody else other than

1969
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,256
Now we're going to get to this special report

1970
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,072
I apologize that we're keeping it in

1971
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,376
Cut out

1972
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,400
The stuff that is

1973
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,936
Redundant for the most part

1974
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,216
Wanting to

1975
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:14,496
Isn't this special report

1976
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,776
Expertly produce

1977
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:17,312
By 1 Rob do

1978
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,896
Because some of his work producer

1979
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
Cameraman

1980
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,456
On-air Talent

1981
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:26,528
Lawyer on-air Talent

1982
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:31,904
Let's call it let's call him on air

1983
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
Start

1984
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,488
And it is

1985
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:43,680
This is already play

1986
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:12,096
Only his news is available to the public

1987
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:18,496
Whoops

1988
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:24,896
April 24th

1989
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:46,656
George Soros

1990
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,896
I don't ever want to hear

1991
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:59,712
Kindness and Alex Jones anywhere f******

1992
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,784
Nope

1993
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,576
Cruelty

1994
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:09,184
You're mistaking my cruelty for

1995
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:11,488
I don't even know

1996
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,768
That's no

1997
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,304
You're a boss.

1998
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,584
Okay

1999
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,656
You know how

2000
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
Is force

2001
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:20,704
To call herself

2002
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,520
Like because by law

2003
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,544
He should be

2004
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,640
Calling earlier

2005
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,176
Just because she is by law a fat

2006
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,224
In the same way

2007
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,504
Alex Jones

2008
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
Should not be allowed to use

2009
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
In regards to him

2010
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,136
I would love

2011
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:42,720
Alex Jones you have to publicly recognize that your propaganda

2012
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
Every speech

2013
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,536
Every episode you have to say

2014
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,816
I'm interpreting

2015
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,608
Non-factor

2016
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
But

2017
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,216
Look what I love.

2018
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,752
Still preserve his free speech

2019
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,312
He would still be allowed to say all the things

2020
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,640
Again

2021
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:04,224
That Cliff was essentially wrestling promo

2022
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:08,832
You're not about to see Alex Jones you're about to meet

2023
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
The American people

2024
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:17,536
And then a blazing red fire filled Infowars logo comes up the music swell

2025
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:21,888
Is just

2026
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
Stanford

2027
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:26,240
This guy came out of nowhere blah blah blah

2028
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,288
A little bit of new information

2029
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,336
He says some really really

2030
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,384
Really hard islamophobia

2031
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
In this

2032
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:35,456
I want it I want to play Just

2033
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,992
I think I'd like five clips

2034
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,784
From the Special Report

2035
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:43,648
Play the special report in this first hour on April 25th

2036
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,208
Package together

2037
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,512
Like

2038
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,536
This is ugly

2039
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,072
This is really really ugly

2040
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,888
There's some fun lies along the way

2041
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,936
But some of the stuff he says

2042
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,472
Is inexcusable

2043
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:59,520
And it is absolutely

2044
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,104
Dog whistling to racist

2045
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,640
At worst

2046
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,432
Incitement to violence

2047
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,224
I think

2048
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:11,296
Far be it for me another legal scholar

2049
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,600
But I sincerely think that were on the cob

2050
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,624
Of life

2051
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,904
Stuff that you

2052
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,440
May not be able

2053
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:18,720
To get away with

2054
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,488
Like

2055
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,280
I don't know

2056
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,560
Necessarily

2057
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:25,376
Fire in a crowded theater

2058
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:28,960
My gut still tells me it's protected free speech

2059
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:32,288
Except for the slander portions get absolutely not okay

2060
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,568
Everything

2061
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,104
About Hamdi ulukaya

2062
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,640
Is absolutely not okay

2063
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,224
Straight up making s*** up slander

2064
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,272
But the staff about like

2065
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,344
Does the horrible stuff he says about Muslims in general

2066
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,624
I hate it

2067
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,672
I'm really against it I think it's hate

2068
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,440
Speech

2069
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,720
But I don't know

2070
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,000
I don't know if it's

2071
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:55,840
It's tough for me to say I'll let you know

2072
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:58,656
Weigh-in as it goes along

2073
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
Just know

2074
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,288
In the four months of doing the show

2075
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
So far

2076
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
We've been

2077
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,104
Ron

2078
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,640
This

2079
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:11,200
And the Chris Cuomo's daughters

2080
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,480
Thing

2081
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,504
Chris Cuomo's children

2082
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,088
Are the the closest I've got to like

2083
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
I can't do this

2084
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,952
Yeah it's just

2085
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,488
So f******

2086
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:24,256
Stupid

2087
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,024
And awful

2088
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:25,792
And I

2089
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,072
Can't wait for him to lose this lawsuit

2090
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,888
Here we go the first clip

2091
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,168
Is not so heavy

2092
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
He has some

2093
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:33,728
Thoughts

2094
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:34,496
About

2095
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:35,776
Hamdi ulukaya

2096
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:37,312
Connection to Turkey

2097
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,104
And he has some of his facts

2098
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:47,296
Islamic dictatorship

2099
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:55,488
Turkey Mike Flynn

2100
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:05,984
Two portions of the u.s. lunch program

2101
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:12,384
He doesn't

2102
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:20,832
It's a phone

2103
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,904
Nope but the part that I think he has

2104
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,208
A little bit wrong is that

2105
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
Came to power in

2106
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,400
2014

2107
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,704
20 years after

2108
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,496
Hamdi ulukaya

2109
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,032
I'm here

2110
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,080
So I I don't I don't

2111
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,040
A dream

2112
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,320
You might be a wisp

2113
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,368
Hearts of man

2114
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,976
There is one swamp in Idaho

2115
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,768
And the will-of-the-wisps

2116
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,840
Finally games

2117
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:07,680
We have a complete lunatic is our president right now

2118
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,984
F****** monster

2119
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,544
Is destroying the world 20 years ago

2120
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:13,824
Was in office

2121
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:17,920
Perfect but it was a very different world back then

2122
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
Government

2123
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,736
Change over the course of 20 years

2124
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,528
So to save it like

2125
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,368
First of all there's no evidence that he has any involvement with the government

2126
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,648
Second

2127
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,208
The government has changed a lot

2128
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:35,072
Trump just congratulated

2129
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:35,840
His power is it

2130
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,400
Guys

2131
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,424
We're in for a great

2132
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960
4 years

2133
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
It shouldn't be

2134
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,384
Everybody who's fun

2135
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,432
Run for

2136
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:53,248
God

2137
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:57,856
Especially Oliver listening in the UK

2138
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:01,440
As long as you become a citizen

2139
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,208
Run for

2140
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,488
But first

2141
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:05,024
Starting yoga pictures

2142
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,096
Or appear out of nowhere

2143
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,912
Imaginary

2144
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,240
Run for

2145
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,264
Because

2146
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,408
Go this isn't this isn't it

2147
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,992
Literally what's half

2148
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,296
Text

2149
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Is trying to cut the corporate rate

2150
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,368

2151
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
215 1st

2152
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,232
They will a

2153
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,768
Because that's what all the

2154
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,048
F****** nightmare

2155
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:39,840
They just

2156
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,864
What text

2157
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,192
Willing to

2158
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Risk

2159
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:47,520
Nuclear goddamn

2160
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,592
F******

2161
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,360
Text

2162
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,480
Kerasotes have President Pence

2163
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,504
Exactly

2164
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:00,320
Let's get rid of all abortion laws let's do

2165
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,136
President

2166
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
Text World bro

2167
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,352
Even if

2168
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,632
So this next

2169
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400
Clip

2170
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,448
It starts with Alex

2171
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:19,264
Fully not understanding what this lawsuit is about

2172
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:20,800
Clearly

2173
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:21,568
Explained

2174
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,336
An established

2175
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,616
It's about headline

2176
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
Contact

2177
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,224
Within articles and videos that he posted

2178
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,760
That were slammed

2179
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,576
Spy the

2180
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:33,600
Literal definition

2181
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,160
The trial should laugh

2182
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
45 bit

2183
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,976
It should be like

2184
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,000
Hey Alex

2185
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,024
You said this

2186
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,560
Did you retract it

2187
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,680
I think it should go a little bit longer cuz you should give Alex a chance to prove it

2188
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:50,496
But he wouldn't be able to

2189
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:57,152
Let him spin his wheels a little bit and then

2190
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,456
Jokester.

2191
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,016
Videoing

2192
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:04,832
Over

2193
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,904
So I understand what's going on with the law

2194
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,184
Expressive

2195
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,792
Islamophobia

2196
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,864
We go there you might scream before we go

2197
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:18,912
Because

2198
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:21,216
Mentally and emotionally preparing

2199
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,264
To survive

2200
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,080
I hope we can only survive

2201
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:26,848
Question

2202
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:29,920
Which

2203
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,712
Which path

2204
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,248
Leads to his

2205
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,016
Destruction

2206
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:38,368
Because Alex Alex is courting

2207
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:40,672
The end of his career

2208
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,976
No matter what really

2209
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,024
If

2210
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,560
Apologize

2211
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:48,352
Traxxas

2212
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,400
About Tabata music

2213
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,168
Right now

2214
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,448
So he doesn't

2215
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,240
He doesn't have to deal with the lawsuit

2216
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,264
Which steaks

2217
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,872
I think I think that at this point because they asked for retraction

2218
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:06,272
I think it's happening no matter what

2219
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:09,088
What if what if lamp

2220
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:11,904
We

2221
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,928
We guess

2222
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,232
Probably correct

2223
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
That if he does that for them

2224
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,328
More of those letters

2225
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:23,936
So we know that then he's got more and more

2226
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,216
Retractions

2227
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,752
Which

2228
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,288
To wind up cutting in

2229
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:33,664
Because they suddenly know it will erode his credibility

2230
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,016
Perception of credibility

2231
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,296
Yeah okay

2232
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,088
So

2233
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,880
To me going to be a slower like

2234
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,904
Like death by 1000

2235
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:44,928
Right

2236
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:45,696
Whereas

2237
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,720
Him

2238
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,000
Pudding

2239
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,536
It's f****** foot down on this

2240
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,096
Now he's going to go

2241
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,424
I don't know if he'll go broke cuz he is

2242
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,960
Crazy rich

2243
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,544
Infowars is really what

2244
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,872
It's not him personally I assume he's personally part of it

2245
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:06,176
But Infowars is going to be hit with

2246
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
Punitive

2247
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:10,016
Is well right right I think it'll be a big hit

2248
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,296
Here's here's what I think

2249
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:13,344
I think it's inevitable

2250
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,880
No matter what he does

2251
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
It's bad for him

2252
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,536
How I would describe

2253
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,584
Branch

2254
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,608
Pam

2255
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
And that decision

2256
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,192
You have the apologize

2257
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,336
If you go down the apologize I think you're assessing

2258
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,104
Correctly

2259
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,896
There will be a bunch of people who will be like

2260
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,176
Now it's time

2261
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:38,944
Farrar's

2262
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,224
And then

2263
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,016
Yeah it will spiral from

2264
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:44,320
If you go that don't apologize root

2265
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
He's going to lose

2266
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,136
Unfortunately

2267
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,416
The exact same results

2268
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,184
Was going to happen

2269
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,208
Once he loses it

2270
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,256
Those people who wanted apology

2271
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,048
These before will now also be

2272
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,864
Yes it will just be a bandwagon

2273
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,632
But

2274
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:00,192
His money on the

2275
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:00,960
Apologize

2276
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,752
Like on this one

2277
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,800
I think he wind up losing everything

2278
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:09,152
I think he hears my

2279
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,944
You think it's a better outcome for

2280
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,224
Losing

2281
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,784
Well that's that was my next thought was

2282
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,576
This is his blaze of glory

2283
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,368
Yeah this is where he gets

2284
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,160
To go down as a martyr

2285
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,952
Instead of as

2286
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,512
Holy Ship

2287
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,048
You know what just came to me

2288
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,584
One of the songs he plays

2289
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,376
Sometime coming in from break

2290
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:34,240
If you ever heard Pancho and Lefty you are interpreting his music as

2291
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,264
His subconscious

2292
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,872
Pancho and Lefty

2293
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:46,272
Willie Nelson Merle Haggard Dead version 2

2294
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:49,088
They could have had any man

2295
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,904
They only let him get

2296
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,928
It's so far

2297
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,720
Out of kindness

2298
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:59,584
Rihanna and will do a

2299
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,168
Covers album do you understand what that

2300
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:05,728
Maurice's

2301
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:08,800
Who got away with the you know a bunch of crimes

2302
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,080
And the federales

2303
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,616
They could have taken him down at any point

2304
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:14,432
At any point in Alex Jones's career

2305
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:19,808
Especially after he calls him a Nazi collaborator

2306
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:22,112
He's the character in Pancho and Lefty

2307
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:25,184
Yeah he is the guy who's gotten away with it

2308
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,720
Out of the kindness

2309
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,792
Or just the I don't want to deal with it of George Soros

2310
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,120
4 out of all of the people on the ulukaya

2311
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,400
James alefantis

2312
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:36,704
All these people who have legit lawsuits

2313
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,520
He only they only let him get so far

2314
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,080
Kindness I suppose

2315
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:47,200
Isaac said I think I might have to deal with

2316
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:51,040
Petroglyphs

2317
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:51,808
Alex Jones

2318
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
Possibly I mean

2319
02:07:53,856 --> 02:08:00,000
There's some other songs that relate I met we talked about the Mike and the mechanics Saga super Alex Jones

2320
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,792
Have to be at 8

2321
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:08,448
Royal music

2322
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:10,752
Who plays we're not going to take it coming out of break

2323
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,032
Obviously there is

2324
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,336
Bubble method

2325
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:15,872
S***

2326
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:17,408
Yeah I think I think

2327
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,432
He is like

2328
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,480
Maybe

2329
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,016
Now we're reading it is

2330
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:25,856
Subconscious way too much but I think there might be a part of himself that sees him

2331
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,136
Self as

2332
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,928
The Last of a Dying Breed

2333
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,720
Like this kind of

2334
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:31,744
Thank f******

2335
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:34,560
The same f******

2336
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
Right

2337
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:38,144
Yeah he's he is part of it

2338
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:42,496
Take the rest of us

2339
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:43,520
With

2340
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:44,544
Possible

2341
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,616
So yeah I agree

2342
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,408
The Blaze of Glory path I think

2343
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,200
Strategically actually is better

2344
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:52,480
Because even if you get

2345
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,040
And Infowars goes out of existence

2346
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,064
He can

2347
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,136
Hold on to some thread of his credibility

2348
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,696
He can present it as

2349
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:02,720
F*** man

2350
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:09,120
This is the globalists screwing me and trying to take everything I have away from me now he's wrong he's lying

2351
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:11,680
But there's enough people who would believe him and pity him

2352
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,984
And even if you get sued

2353
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,288
Put on the bankruptcy

2354
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,080
He can get a job

2355
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,872
Like he can

2356
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:26,272
What are you talkin about maybe you can get that f****** turn down over and over again

2357
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:30,880
Like he could land somewhere if he get sued into Oblivion

2358
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,416
No one tire

2359
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:36,256
The grace to possibly do in that trial

2360
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,560
The propaganda skills

2361
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,096
He has at his disposal

2362
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:42,144
I think you could turn it into a complete circle

2363
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:44,192
Do you know what I think he's going to do

2364
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,520
I think he's going to pull a Bill O'Reilly and when he gets kicked off the air

2365
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,312
He's going to

2366
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,104
Call the brain battle

2367
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:54,176
Oh no

2368
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,480
Revo clips

2369
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:00,576
Parody on Colbert is brain fights catalyst

2370
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,112
Still available

2371
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,488
Speculation

2372
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,792
The next thing is

2373
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:10,816
He is

2374
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,632
He's going to go broke

2375
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,656
My theory is

2376
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,448
Homeless

2377
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
He fights all these

2378
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:19,264
And thankfully he's going to lose custody

2379
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,104
Exactly

2380
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,384
Even if it goes

2381
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,664
Completely broke you still go

2382
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,224
That's how this works in our society

2383
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,976
A cynical as I am

2384
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,608
Golden parachute

2385
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,400
To bulshit

2386
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,680
He has I just

2387
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:50,752
I just want to

2388
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,288
Post 19

2389
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,080
1920s

2390
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,872
You see all the

2391
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,640
Guys who use

2392
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:57,408
Used to be million

2393
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,200
Sucking broken

2394
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,272
Broken

2395
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:09,184
Coming soon to America near you cuz it's just more about the tuberculosis outbreak

2396
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
React

2397
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:14,304
It's not happening as we documented the people they are the album

2398
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:17,120
Yeah and the people on the ground or saying

2399
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,144
This is not that

2400
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,168
The cases we've looked at

2401
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:19,936
Contagious

2402
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,984
Yep it's not a public health risk at all

2403
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,544
Deal with every immigrant

2404
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,592
Comes in within 90 days of them being

2405
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:28,896
So are there

2406
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:32,480
The fiction book

2407
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:36,320
All the Hat I just don't think it's worth pointing out is again all the things

2408
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,112
That he brings up our headlines

2409
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:39,136
Are awful

2410
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,928
So great

2411
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:43,488
Breitbart will not hold up in court

2412
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,816
He tries to cite that as evidence

2413
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,840
Of his argument

2414
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,376
Is done

2415
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,424
That seems

2416
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,960
To me that seems like

2417
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,752
That puts brightburn

2418
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,384
Oh no he's he's introducing them into the conversation

2419
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:05,504
Alex

2420
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,272
For this

2421
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,552
Defamatory

2422
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:10,624
And he introduces

2423
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:13,440
Doesn't that then mean that you

2424
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,720
Absolutely have a case

2425
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:23,936
Actually you know what we can't

2426
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:27,008
This next clip

2427
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:29,568
But I thought of

2428
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:31,616
About

2429
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,408
I mean it's just more about Hamdi

2430
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:35,968
Yeah but it is is like sort of getting into

2431
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,248
Alex Jones

2432
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,808
Problem

2433
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,576
Youjizz

2434
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:41,344
And then

2435
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,624
He plays this quit

2436
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,904

02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,184

Any

2441
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:52,096
He presented in a menacing way

2442
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,888
But I want you to really listen to it

2443
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:57,984
Tell you my perspective on it ahead of time

2444
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,008
I think it's a great

2445
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,568
We'll see if you agree

2446
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:02,336
Just like agenda

2447
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,456

2449
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:23,840

02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:31,520
Undertaker 1951 convention

2451
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:37,664
Activator for refugees at the responsibility

2452
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:44,064
Hiding behind borders and fences

2453
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:50,208
We have to work together cooperatively together to make it better work

2454
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:52,000
She plays that clip

2455
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,304
Evidence

2456
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
That's supposed to be

2457
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:56,864
Yeah

2458
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,400
Nefarious

2459
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:01,472
Okay well no I understand first off

2460
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,264
I want him

2461
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,800
To narrate audiobook

2462
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,592
Carlos L Adelman

2463
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:16,320
It's beautiful the most relaxing MSR video

2464
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,600
It's an MSR you

2465
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:21,696
Where am I

2466
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:26,048
ASMR the only thing that I think you could really take issue with

2467
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:28,096
Especially based on Alex Jones is worldviews

2468
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,120
You saying that like we can

2469
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,144
Hidebehind border

2470
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:35,264
Because I was pissed off about the idea that we don't have

2471
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:36,288
But

2472
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:39,104
What he's actually saying there is that like

2473
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,432
Pretending the issues outside of our country don't relate to us

2474
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:45,248
The old way of thinking

2475
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,040
Now

2476
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,112
People being brutalized

2477
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:50,880
Another country

2478
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:51,904
You are trying to

2479
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
Leave at

2480
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:54,464
Or our responsibility

2481
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:55,744
And it is heart

2482
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,304
To be like no

2483
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,352
We're afraid you might hurt us

2484
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,424
The Peter Sutherland

2485
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,704
If that's the best

2486
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,472
You've got

2487
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,240
Against him

2488
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,520
You failed

2489
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,568
He sounds like he's really

2490
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:14,176
Yep and I assure you our

2491
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:18,016
The end is also we want Islam to take over the world

2492
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:20,320
Positive

2493
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:23,136
Hundred percent

2494
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:24,416
We okay with that

2495
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:25,440
Ulta beauty like

2496
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:29,024
Okay

2497
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
So

2498
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,632
That that does seem to be the center

2499
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,400
Conflict

2500
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,192
OurTime

2501
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,472
Is

2502
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,264
The internet

2503
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,544
Exploded

2504
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,568
Globalization

2505
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,104
So much faster

2506
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
Human races

2507
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,200

2508
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:47,968
Across the

2509
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:49,504
Nose

2510
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:51,296
Well I mean if your Kinect

2511
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,064
Did the internet

2512
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,344
You know what's going on

2513
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,880
Or you can find out with

2514
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:56,416
Anywhere on the play

2515
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,440
Witches

2516
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:59,744
Something that was not pause

2517
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,792
Before 2000

2518
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:04,352
Simply wasn't a real thing

2519
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,144
So he's

2520
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,680
When he says that

2521
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,984
The days of borders

2522
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:10,752
Ozark

2523
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:11,520

Citizens of the world

2527
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:22,272
I'd like I would say to me

2528
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:24,320
The way I see myself

2529
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:26,112
I am less than America

2530
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:27,648
That I am

2531
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,672
Human being

2532
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:32,256
I agree with that I find I find the the idea of

2533
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:33,280
America

2534
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,048
Not just

2535
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,840
You know not least of which to be

2536
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,400
Like it is

2537
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:40,448

As much good as it's done

2541
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:47,616
Also committed a s*** ton of genocide

2542
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:49,408
Has murdered so many civilians

2543
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,688
Is absolutely.

2544
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:51,712
Destroying the protection

2546
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,040
Every single part of the United

2547
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:55,808
Now

2548
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:56,576
Is

2549
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,856
Eating itself alive

2550

And that's all it is

2553
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:06,816
But their strike the United States

I do too

2564
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:30,624
Let me ask you a question

2565
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:32,672
Is it do you think of it it's

2566
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,952
The same way that like

2567
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:35,488
You feel like less

2568
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:37,792
A citizen of Illinois then you do

Text Emily we live in Illinois

2573
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:49,568
I live in America but we're citizens of the world

2574
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,336
It's just

2575
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:51,872
Going to the next

2576
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:53,408
Level

2577
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:59,552

That's to me the compass

02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:19,008
Is it between

2586
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:20,544
And and it's

2587
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,080
It's Barry Allen Oliver

2588

These elections here

2589
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,920

That's

2593
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,344
The ultimate lesson of

Our next clip

02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,304

02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:22,144
As we're playing this I am starting to realize

2621
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:22,912
You do sound a little

2622
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:26,496
The report not as bad as that

2623
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:28,800
March 30th

2624
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:29,824
But

2625
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,104
I mean

2626
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:33,664
I'm not here

2627
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,944
Vanderlaan Zach's

2628
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:38,272
No refunds

2629
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:39,040
He is

2630
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,064
Truly

2631
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:42,368
Journalist

2632
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:45,952
Terrible

2633
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,512
The only

2634
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:51,840
Coup attempt that I genuinely

2635
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,376
I'm so like

2636
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:56,192
There is very little doubt in my mind that that was

2637
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,728
A literal false

2638
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,800
Totally and that is such a

2639
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:03,360
One it's a it's a

2640
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:05,664
It's a brilliant move

2641
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:07,968
It's a brilliant move if no one had done it but

2642
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:08,736
Before

2643
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:10,272
And no one could like

2644
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,064
Do some signs of this

2645
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,088
Didn't really go down

2646
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,672
Cultural revolution

2647
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:17,440
In China

2648
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:22,560
Whenever he wants to like come up and demonize erdewan

2649
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:23,840
Ever

2650
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:24,608
F****** wrestle with

2651
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:28,192
The fact Mike Flynn was paid by them to the lobby on their behalf

2652
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:29,984
That makes

2653
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,264
Plan has registered as

2654
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:32,032
Is a foreign agent

2655
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,312
Turkey

2656
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,080
And

2657
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:35,104
The Heat

2658
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,640
Constantly

2659
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:37,920
Him and his son

2660
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,456
What are retweet Infowars

2661
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:44,320
And I have no doubt in my mind that the two of them have spoken

2662
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:48,672
Before I don't know I don't know I just know up I mean

2663
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:52,256
Based on based on comments that he's made it

2664
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:54,048
Past

2665
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,096
He's made sort of indication

2666
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:58,400
Information

2667
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,680
A phlegm

2668
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:04,800
But not from erdogan himself

2669
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:10,176
No connection between Alex and Alex

2670
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,248
No

2671
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:17,344
I'm shocked that he doesn't make fun of how Sebastian Gorka

2672
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:20,160
No early ones name

2673
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:21,696
He might not even wrote

2674
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:25,536
Never brought tomorrow

2675
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:30,144
We have a literal doctoral

2676
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:35,520
So I was reading up on that on foreign policy

2677
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:36,544
Very

2678
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,080
Globalist

2679
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:38,848
He cites Wickham

2680
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:41,408
Pedia and a couple other like really on

2681
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:42,432
Scholarly sources

2682
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,736
It came out recently that he defended

2683
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,016
His doctoral thesis

2684
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,832
In front of not a doctoral committee

2685
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:51,392
He may not actually have a doctor

2686
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:57,280
Sounds like he got a mail order.

2687
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,608
He's a literal

2688
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:03,168
You know that rule of like the

2689
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:06,496
When you bring up Hitler the internet rule

2690
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,776
He's an actual

2691
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,568
Like he's a literal

2692
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,360
He was part of an order

2693
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,688
It was it was

2694
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:15,968
Yeah

2695
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,272
Has a Nazi

2696
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,624
National Security

2697
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:25,440
44 whenever we had our Nazis

2698
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,208
Develop

2699
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:26,976
Science 4A

2700
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:28,256
This is like

2701
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:29,024
Hey

2702
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,816
You know what genocide you guys are

2703
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:35,424
Wernher von Braun coming over cuz he knows a lot about rocket

2704
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:43,104
We're flippantly talkin about it we're not serious

2705
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:50,016
Like I told you about this before we started recording

2706
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,832
I had a dream last night that was about

2707
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:55,904
Coming nuclear war

2708
02:23:58,464 --> 02:24:02,048
Just don't think the M very much like

2709
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:05,376
It was at that moment where we know the we know the

2710
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:11,008
The missiles are coming and they're about to hit you know It's Goin Down

2711
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,312
And with with nuclear missiles

2712
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:14,848
But in this

2713
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:15,872
Particular in

2714
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:17,408
You would have

2715
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:19,200
Time like they would report

2716
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,760
Few minutes are the missiles coming

2717
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,832
It takes it takes a while

2718
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:28,928
Like it takes a half hour time is a few minutes but then the actual

2719
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:31,232
Yeah exactly

2720
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,256
Are they wouldn't tell us

2721
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,888
The point was the point that there is

2722
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:41,728
Escape from

2723
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,800
There was definitely a lot of relief and

2724
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:47,104
Where am I

2725
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,384
Well

2726
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,408
Finally f******

2727
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:52,736
Hangover like waking up now knowing that it's

2728
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:56,576
Probably coming I mean we've compared it a couple times to like

2729
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,368
Just basically

2730
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,392
Play

2731
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:02,464
Just come already

2732
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:05,280
Sing about that

2733
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,048
That kind of

2734
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:06,816
Fear is

2735
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:09,376
My my instinctive course is

2736
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,144
To take that

2737
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:15,520
Not going to destroy the world but the more you read about the the Cold War

2738
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,800
We came

2739
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:18,592
3 *

2740
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,616
We came

2741
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:22,432
Minutes away from an act

2742
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:25,760
Old nuclear war was largely inactive

2743
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:31,136
What do like come on guys

2744
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:31,904
Let's not do this

2745
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:34,976
False alarm

2746
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,792
That's like the Russians

2747
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,584
Thought that missiles had been launched

2748
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:40,864
And they they

2749
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,168
And there was a guy who was

2750
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:44,704
Sent to Siberia

2751
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,496
For being the guy who

2752
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:50,080
Defied the Russian government

2753
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:50,848
He did

2754
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,128
Personally

2755
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:54,688
One man Saves the World

2756
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,456
Exact

2757
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:57,504
Because you could never reveal the

2758
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,784
One man save the world

2759
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:04,160
So it is it is that kind of thing where you're like well this fear is irrational but

2760
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:04,928
I find it

2761
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:06,464
Super rash

2762
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,488
It seems on the

2763
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,304
Yeah it really does know Jordan

2764
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,328
Two more clips

2765
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:12,352
These are ugly

2766
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:14,144
Is a very ugly

2767
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:14,912
I've saved

2768
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:16,192
The worst for last

2769
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:21,568
I didn't save them it's all in chronological order the order

2770
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:26,688
No I understand I'm not blaming you I am just saying that you are the bane of my

2771
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,088
First clip

2772
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Defend himself

2773
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:37,184
Because these are so bad

2774
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:40,000
I want to talk over them

2775
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:42,048
By this first one

2776
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:45,120
He talks about how he's going to

2777
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:45,888
To act

2778
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,936
In this court case

2779
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,472
Talk about

2780
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,008
Basically hopes

2781
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:54,592
That the Iowa dirty are the Idaho jury is as racist

2782
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:01,760
And then he just gets into what I would describe as

2783
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:03,040
Straight up

2784
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:04,064
Literal race

2785
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:06,112
So here's that

2786
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:07,136
Mike down

2787
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:22,240
I'm just going to pause it there really quick because when he says all when they see all of this

2788
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:24,800
Is referencing a bunch of Breitbart article

2789
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:26,336
Was that he had shown before that

2790
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:31,968
Just forget just to give it some contacts at all propaganda s***

2791
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:32,992
Be f****** not admit

2792
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,320
But then he applies

2793
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:38,368
All your employees hate you anyway

2794
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:40,416
Patty

2795
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:41,696
Probably not true

2796
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:44,512
Is he treats his employees hope it's not

2797
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:47,328
Doesn't

2798
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,096
Trump

2799
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,632
Having Teddy comes

2800
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:51,168
Herbalife

2801
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:11,904
That's pathetic

2802
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:13,696
They're so

2803
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,000
Manny

2804
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,024
So many

2805
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:17,792
Manny

2806
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:19,584
Do you know this goes down to like

2807
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:21,888
Alex not knowing

2808
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,448
VIP people are decrying the

2809
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:26,240
These things and there are a bunch of

2810
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:27,264
Credibly

2811
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:28,800
Awesome

2812
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:31,104
Wonderful people who haven't

2813
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:31,872
To be Muslim

2814
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,664
It's not because

2815
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:35,968
They don't exist

2816
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:36,992
It's because he doesn't

2817
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:38,016
Try to find him

2818
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:41,600
It's just something he doesn't know about

2819
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:42,880
Exactly

2820
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,184
If this idea that like

2821
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:49,536
All of the information that I represent on this show

2822
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,560
Elvis

2823
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,096
About

2824
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:53,632
The Idaho situation

2825
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,168
Tuberculosis outbreak

2826
02:28:55,424 --> 02:28:55,936
All the stuff

2827
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:58,240
Isn't information that's on accessible to him

2828
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,520
It's like he doesn't want to engage

2829
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:02,080
The fact that he has in the past that the

2830
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:03,104
The Sandy Hook was fake

2831
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,128
It was all actors

2832
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:05,920
Isn't information he doesn't know

2833
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:06,688
Defamation

2834
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,456
Camp no

2835
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:09,248
Review have to stop doing what he's doing

2836
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,528
It's information

2837
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:11,808
That I would

2838
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:12,832
Suspect

2839
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,368
His people

2840
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:15,648
Either

2841
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:17,184
Purposely

2842
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,208
Implicitly

2843
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:18,976
Keep away from

2844
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:21,024
Right and what's unfortunate is

2845
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,816
If you don't know that information

2846
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:24,096
Reality

2847
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,632
What you end up doing is

2848
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:26,400
What you just did

2849
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:27,680
Which is

2850
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:29,216
Brutal

2851
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:29,984
Hatred

2852
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:31,520
Of all Muslims

2853
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,800
Based on

2854
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:34,336
Hawaii

2855
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:37,152
And this is this is the other thing that we

2856
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:38,432
We talked about earlier

2857
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:39,456
About

2858
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:41,248
Being about that

2859
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:42,784
Idealized version

2860
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:44,320
Of America

2861
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:46,112
That idealized version

2862
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:47,392
America is

2863
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:49,696
One thing that I ate

2864
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
Did that does

2865
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,000
Exist

2866
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,792
Is the way that

2867
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,072
So many

2868
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:56,096
Immigrants

2869
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:58,144
Come from so many different

2870
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,424
As with so many different

2871
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:02,496
Eventually what happened

2872
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:05,824
We all see ourselves

2873
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,152
And so a lot of that

2874
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:10,432
A lot of that

2875
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,736
Cultural shift

2876
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:14,784
From way back when

2877
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,552
That

2878
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:17,600
Like the genital mutilation

2879
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:20,416
So many Muslim

2880
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,208
In America

2881
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:23,488
F******

2882
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:25,280
Sure

2883
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,328
Because they're Americans

2884
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,400
Part of our values are

2885
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,960
Turtle girls

2886
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,496
Sure

2887
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,664
Whatever reason why they gravitated here in the first place

2888
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,736
And how have we like

2889
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,784
Like how is it that we

2890
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:47,808
Become

2891
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,832
Allies with

2892
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,880
Germany

2893
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:51,904
Japan after

2894
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,952
It wasn't by

2895
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,232
Demonizing

2896
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:57,536
It was my thing

2897
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:00,096
Caesar this is Who We Are

2898
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:08,800
Complicated

2899
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:09,824
Rrr

2900
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:11,104
Our values

2901
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:14,432
Steve the idealized American values

2902
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:16,480
Are far more effective

2903
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:17,504
Combating

2904
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:18,784
Terrorism in

2905
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,808
Combating all of the

2906
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,832
Anime

2907
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:26,464
You know what you thought only create more terror

2908
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:28,256
What did I do

2909
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:30,048
You just mirrored Alex Jones

2910
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:32,608
He makes the Arkham

2911
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,888
The Americana

2912
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:34,656
Is the bestest

2913
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:40,032
The sexiest system

2914
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:41,568
Everybody loves it

Not today

2918
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:51,040
No we have different definition

2919
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:52,832
It's not important

2920
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,368
I agree with you

2921
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:00,768
Idealized version of what

2922
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:03,840
Analyzed

2923
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,632
Aspirational versions of

2924
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:08,192
The freedom and tolerance and no such a thing

2925
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,984
Exactly

2926
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,592
We're going to eat this last clip

2927
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:15,872
I think

2928
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:17,152
A couple minutes long

2929
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:18,688
But it's worth it

2930
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:20,992
For the roller coaster ride that it will take you

2931
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:22,784

I might closet at one point I don't know

2937
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,048
It is

2938
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:35,328
Disgusting

2939
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,144
And I can't stress that enough

2940
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:39,680
This is okay

2941
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:41,728
I hate it

2942
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,520
And I hate Alex for sale

2943
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:51,968

02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:29,984
What is the heat

3003
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,264
Arguing

3004
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,800
A certain group is using

3005
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:34,080
Islam as a weapon

3006
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:36,128
In the act

3007
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,688
Using Islam

3008
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:40,480
As a promotional

3009
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:42,528
Yeah he doesn't mean any of it

3010
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,808
There is

3011
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:45,600
Know if you are

3012
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:46,624
Believer

3013
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:47,904
Literally any

3014
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,208
And you are sharing

3015
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:55,584
You should engage would like heck

3016
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,352
Every

3017
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,120
Every

3018
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,144
Possible

3019
02:37:58,656 --> 02:37:59,168
Religious tax

3020
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,008
Morality

3021
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,544
Right

3022
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:06,848
Emotional

3023
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:09,920
Yeah like there's no there's no other

3024
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:10,944
Dividing line

3025
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:13,504
There's another problem

3026
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,784
They never really address

3027
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:16,832
We talked about the

3028
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:17,856
The judeo-christian

3029
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:18,624
In Tradition

3030
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:20,160
There could just ask the label

3031
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:21,952
I don't I don't like hearing that

3032
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:24,000
I was apart of it

3033
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:25,280
Do not

3034
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:26,816
As long as a part of the

3035
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:29,632
As we all know Islam doesn't believe that

3036
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:35,776
Never reference

3037
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:36,800
No no

3038
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:37,568
Definitely not

3039
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:39,104
That Jesus character

3040
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:41,664
Even a lot of Eastern religion

3041
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:42,432
Recognized

3042
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,480
I mean a lot

3043
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:50,368
There's a real cool dude

3044
02:38:50,624 --> 02:38:51,136
But

3045
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:53,952
Degree

3046
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:55,744
Jesus

3047
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:02,144
So that last clip I just feel like

3048
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,424
For a little bit burnt out on

3049
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:07,264
Is hate so we're not responding

3050
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,312
Through this entire f

3051
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,080
Episode

3052
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:11,104
As as much

3053
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,128
You built that

3054
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:12,896
Clip Up

3055
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:14,432
That

3056
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,456
Just

3057
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,992
Parcel

3058
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,552
Light amplification

3059
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:23,392
Like I'd like on your iTunes you click the volume up one

3060
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:24,416
Time and that's his race

3061
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:26,976
Disagree but just be

3062
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:28,512
Because of how passionate

3063
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:29,280
Italy like

3064
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:30,816
Exploiting

3065
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:33,120
Christianity was and then

3066
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,424
And then going out to break

3067
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:37,984
Ending the report on saying our God is

3068
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,800
The true God right across the state

3069
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
Hanok god of Islam

3070
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:44,640
But hold on right before that

3071
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:47,712
Saying if you give us money we will do this

3072
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:49,248
That's right

3073
02:39:49,504 --> 02:39:50,272
So over it

3074
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:51,552
So clear that you

3075
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:56,160
He's a con artist who's being

3076
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,720
Because he didn't understand

3077
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:01,280
F****** libel and slander laws

3078
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,304
Andy's

3079
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,632
Begging his audience to please give me a bunch of money so I can

3080
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:06,400
Stay in this

3081
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:08,448
I'm about to

3082
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,472
88

3083
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:11,520
Crazy

3084
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:13,568
How does a guy like this become

3085
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:14,848
What he is

3086
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:15,872
It's for

3087
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:20,992
Who is the multiple lawsuits

3088
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:26,880
Using Christianity and exploited who is Connie

3089
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,096
I got like this could never become president

3090
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,144
Alex 2020

3091
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:41,984
That is likely as f****** anything

3092
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,264
Holyshit

3093
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:45,824
That isn't like

3094
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:46,848
It's f****** auntie

3095
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:52,224
F****** radio show

3096
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:55,296
If you have 45 million weekly listeners

3097
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,856
That's a big built-in fan

3098
02:40:58,368 --> 02:40:59,904
How many votes did f****** Hillary

3099
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:00,672
Get30

3100
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:01,952
No I don't know

3101
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:02,976
No way more than

3102
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:04,000
I don't know numbers

3103
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,328
Let's just go

3104
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:09,888
Alright

3105
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:11,424
Vermilion so anyway

3106
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,960
I think we've come

3107
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:15,008
To I would like to submit

3108
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:17,568
By saying that Alex Jones

3109
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,592
Shoney's cards

3110
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,616
Really

3111
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:21,408
Really angry

3112
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:23,200
But doesn't really

3113
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:25,248
Stand

3114
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:26,272
Bad facts

3115
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:28,320
Either he's really angry

3116
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:29,856
He knows his

3117
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:30,880
Listenership

3118
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:32,160
His listeners

3119
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,952
Really angry it is

3120
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,232
And so he's

3121
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:36,256
Explain

3122
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:37,280
To get as much money

3123
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:40,096
It kind of feels real though I think

3124
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:43,168
I think there might be some bigotry on his part

3125
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,704
That that is

3126
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:51,616
Responsible

3127
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:57,760
We've established that but how much how much does he probably not

3128
02:41:58,016 --> 02:41:59,040
He just he just

3129
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,856
The money man

3130
02:42:02,112 --> 02:42:05,440
So he's got some custody battle he's got some lawsuits to go for

3131
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:07,488
Future lawsuit

3132
02:42:07,744 --> 02:42:08,512
Better f******

3133
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:12,096
So that's conclusion number one is that he hates Muslim

3134
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:13,376
In some way

3135
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:14,400
Weather

3136
02:42:15,168 --> 02:42:21,312
More advantageous weather is moderate or 1000%

3137
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:22,336
Second conclusion

3138
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:23,104
Yes

3139
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:24,896
Hamdi ulukaya

3140
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:26,432
Can you add a good dude

3141
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:27,968
Awesome

3142
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:30,016
Two other billionaires

3143
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:35,392
How to do what he's doing pretty good I'm not saying he has a perfect record I'm sure there's some

3144
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:38,720
The same with any human in the world

3145
02:42:40,768 --> 02:42:41,792
He's killing it

3146
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:44,096
So far seems like it

3147
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:45,888
Is going to win this loss

3148
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:49,984
Alex Jones

3149
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:51,008
Sweet Leaf

3150
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,032
He has no key

3151
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:54,848
He's elated out over the course of an hour

3152
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:56,384
The only things he has our

3153
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:58,432
He's a part of the Federal Reserve

3154
02:42:58,688 --> 02:42:59,200
He's not

3155
02:42:59,712 --> 02:43:01,504
He's connected with George Soros

3156
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:02,528
Yes they're both

3157
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:04,576
Global a bedroom

3158
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:06,624
Picture on Twitter

3159
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:10,208
Please increase Court

3160
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:12,256
The judge.

3161
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,864
Flimsiest Alex is going to lose this case

3162
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,912
But I'd like to remind you

3163
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:27,104
Alex good luck

3164
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,128
Really is

3165
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:34,784
We should start looking for another right-wing topic I've told you we got

3166
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:46,304
We could do any of these episodes about that

3167
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:51,936
I'm glad there's no end to right-wing propaganda terrible of that was

3168
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:53,984
Seems like hateful white people having

3169
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:54,752
A non-exhaustive

3170
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:55,520
Multiply

3171
02:43:55,776 --> 02:43:56,544
Anger

3172
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:57,568
Minorities

3173
02:43:58,080 --> 02:43:58,592
Strange

3174
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:00,640
It's almost like our entire country

3175
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:01,920
Almost

3176
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:04,224
It's almost like our society

3177
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:07,040
Is gone in the direction of recognize

3178
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:08,320
And trying to work

3179
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:09,600
Towards equity

3180
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:13,184
And people can't get on board with really threatened by it

3181
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:13,952
Cannery

3182
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:14,976
Yep

3183
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:16,768
Yeah anyway

3184
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:17,792
Guys

3185
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:20,096
Let me ask you a question

3186
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:22,144
Is going to get sued

3187
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:22,912
Hard

3188
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,496
Are you just want to say that again

3189
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:28,800
It's very exciting

3190
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:29,568
Looking

3191
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,592
2

3229
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:10,175

3230
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:11,711
UCF

3231
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:12,991
You slander man

3232
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:14,015
Who didn't deserve it

3233
02:46:14,527 --> 02:46:15,807
IU base

3234
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:16,831
Most of your point

3235
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:20,415
Listening

3236
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:21,183
Cruelty

3237
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,231
This is legitimately just

3238
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:24,511
Mason Point chick

3239
02:46:24,767 --> 02:46:25,535
Coming home to roost

3240
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:27,583
You thought no one would notice you

3241
02:46:27,839 --> 02:46:28,607
Been getting away with it for

3242
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:29,375
For so long

3243
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:30,655
Just saying whatever you want

3244
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,191
I had a guy stepped up

3245
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:32,959
Said no

3246
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:34,239
I got to put up with this

3247
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:38,335
And now you're suffering no

3248
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:45,503
You are suffering the consequences and you don't deserve anyone to come to your house

3249
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:46,527
Because you suck

3250
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:49,855
Single finger

3251
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:51,903
You deserve it

3252
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,487
Now this is a f*****-up

3253
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:01,631
I wonder if they'll play this video in York

3254
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:04,959
Cuz it seems like

3255
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:07,519
Like we said this

3256
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:10,079
Just play every video every

3257
02:47:10,335 --> 02:47:12,383
If I were a judge

3258
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:15,967
And the way I heard it

3259
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:18,015
He recorded this yesterday

3260
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:21,343
In the middle of it he talks about how he's not fake

3261
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:23,391
He's not an actor he's not

3262
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:24,671
And then

3263
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:26,463
Misaligned Muslim

3264
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:27,487
Why

3265
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:30,559
Says he's not fake news but

3266
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:34,143
Delivers fake news Wild Thing

3267
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:36,191
Says that the Islamic God

3268
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:37,983
Yep

3269
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:38,751
Insight

3270
02:47:39,263 --> 02:47:40,031
People to violin

3271
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:41,567
Basically

3272
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:43,871
I don't understand why you would do that

3273
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:45,407
I don't like

3274
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:47,711
Cuz he's losing

3275
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:50,271
How do I get help Alex

3276
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:52,575
Until next time

3277
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:53,855

3278
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:57,695

3280
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:03,071

3281
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:05,119
Just struggle

3282
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:06,143
We have been on

3283
02:48:07,679 --> 02:48:08,191
Would you call

3284
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:09,983

3285
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:12,543

3286
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:18,687
