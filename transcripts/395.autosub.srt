1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for snowledge b b

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
What's fight.com

6
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody a little bit about

7
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Indeed we are. That's my new intro

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Saturday

9
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
Dan 2020

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Have you ever really f***** up at work

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
Lego

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
Really f***** up

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
Yeah I'm in the ton ton tons of time

14
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,904
I've been a terrible employee a lot of Japan fired

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,464
Lot in my younger days

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,304
I remember the car wash there's a there's a lot of

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
I know you were fired at about rehired as a man

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
Manager was fired as a projection

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
I'm not sure I think I quit when I was a projection

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
I came back

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
Beginning managers fired at the time was just like an usher

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Box office

23
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,880
I was hired and fired and quit they are a lot of times over the years

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
You look like a bad relationship

25
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
I don't know I did screw up there a bit

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
Nothing too terrible a lot of the times the script

27
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
Your kind of manageable

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
In a popcorn popper

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
You have this big

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Cabinet thing

31
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,664
The kettle that hangs down from the canal

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
Yeah and that pops the popcorn into the display thing when I go see the popcorn ready

33
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
Mi Lottery

34
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Right

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
Underneath it in

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
The cabinet is a giant

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Sing full of oil

38
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,352
But it has a little feed pump that goes up smoothie

39
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Press a button

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,288
You've got to refill that oil bucket needs peanut oil in their whatever TV

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
And one time I don't remember if I was responsible for this

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Somebody else was

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,784
But the bucket got knocked over and there was oil all over

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,160
There's an oil all over the place is everyone sleeping around trying to get candy and drinks for people

45
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,512
Does vodka have screwed up a lot at work

46
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
And I know

47
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Alex Jones

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Planning it working I don't know anybody

49
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
Today we got it I guess maybe this is

50
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Zumiez grown up at work

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
We got another sort of what I'm going to call another mini so

52
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
We we set out

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
For like there's so much going on in the world recovering the

54
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
This present day stuff

55
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
My plan

56
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
This on

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
Tuesday in my plan was to

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
To cover Tuesdays episode

59
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Like what

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Today's episode of

61
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
For Wednesday

62
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,584
There was something that happened on Monday night I don't know if you noticed

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Spell was the Iowa caucus

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,728
You know there's a lot going on in the world needs figure Alex Jones has

65
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Probably

66
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Even if the Iowa caucus went off without incident or any kind of trouble Alex would have some sort of

67
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Bulshit to spend about it and it's relevant

68
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,856
Eat that and then you have the situation as it did on folder there are a lot of questions

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
Spiraling around about

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Eisenhower

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,536
No one's really sure who won even as we work or

72
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
The most apropos thing that could

73
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Could possibly happen in 2020 to the Democratic party

74
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
It's literally like I was hearing that happening as I

75
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Oh yeah that makes sense

76
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,079
It was now that it was not a oh my God how could

77
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
He was like yeah

78
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
That's that's

79
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
There was a sense of like last night watching the coverage of it.

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Hoo-boy

81
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Come on

82
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
Come on guys

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Guys

84
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
So I figured it was watching it last night

85
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Alex is going to have a field day with this

86
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
This is going to be

87
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Outrage

88
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
But then I turned into the episode today in order to prepare episode and Mike Adams and Owen Shroyer

89
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Alex is gone

90
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,847
Total abdication of responsibility on that one is

91
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Staggering

92
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
Just so it's clear like you know we're recording this on Tuesday and so it's last night was the Iowa

93
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Caucuses in 20

94
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
20 +

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,903
We're not going to talk too much about

96
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
That

97
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
And we will probably on a future episode but the reality is that this is a podcast where we talk about Alex Jones is

98
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Claims about things

99
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,959
That sounds Jones doesn't have any claims that we can address about that caucus

100
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,359
It seems like I don't I don't want to just do I want to be a news show where we get into everything that's going on

101
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,735
I need Alex to bounce off of

102
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,575
We can dress them but for now it might be disappointing but

103
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
There's no hot takes

104
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
About the present day

105
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,999
Necessarily coming from me

106
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
Be the obvious take is holyshit

107
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Dum Dums

108
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
What

109
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Don't

110
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Hot to take don't do that

111
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
The scorching

112
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
DNC

113
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,687
So I guess I don't know

114
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
We'll get there when we

115
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Right

116
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
So I thought like

117
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,903
Okay Super Bowl was Sunday Alex probably could be mad about Shakira on Monday

118
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,767
Podos Watson toasting on Monday

119
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
I don't care

120
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
No

121
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Certainly not

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,495
It's so like I'm not covering Paul Joseph Watson doing his a boutique culture

123
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Concerned he'll do

124
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
And we go to Sunday

125
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Cuz I listen to a bit of Sunday

126
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
We'll talk a little bit about Sunday but then I decided I'm just going to go far afield

127
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
And find something to talk about and see what that's why today is a little bit of a grab

128
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
A little bit of Sunday

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm a little

130
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,559

Noteflight.com

176
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Maybe very lovely

177
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
Start off on doing this little bit

178
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
From February 2nd this last Sunday I had tuned in and one of the things that

179
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
The first lady of note is it Alex's recording not from Studio

180
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
He's sitting at a desk

181
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Somewhere maybe a hotel room

182
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
And the sound is a

183
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Atrocious

184
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
And he gets into the show and immediately just like

185
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
I have no time for this

186
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
I've no

187
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
I'm getting very sick

188
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Vista ladies and gentlemen

Thank you for joining us on this live

190
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
Sunday broadcast I am on the road

191
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
And we

192
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Just have incredible break

193
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
He knows that just went live that is

194
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Global explosion

195
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Conjunction with natural news.com

196
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
With my cat

197
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Raquel Houston

198
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Coming up 2nd hour

199
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Myself and

200
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Pampered

201
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
To the main house I wanted to be able to

202
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
I'll get to all this new evidence

203
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Emergent is Coronavirus

204
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Bio weapon

205
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Might have been

206
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Experiment gone wrong

207
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Genes contain

208
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
MP shuttle

209
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
SMS

210
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Proving laboratory origin

211
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Now why is

212
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
So important

213
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Well I came out

214
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Arrowhead

215
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Reported on India newspaper

216
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Aegis scientific

217
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Research Center

218
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Buy used computers

219
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Regine at it

220
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Clearly had

221
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Another virus

222
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Is welded in

223
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Including the original HIV

224
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
Got to control corporate media come out and

225
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Say oh well

226
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Lexus

227
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Read the paper

228
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
They said zerohedge made up

229
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Okay

230
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Zerohedge

231
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Outage.

232
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
The doctors by

233
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
An NFL quarterback

234
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
That's how they

235
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
I took the second call anything harassment

236
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Big Jack

237
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
So you know right away there's

238
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
This paper

239
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Prestigious

240
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
It's prestigious you know it I've always thought that

241
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
There are two famous types

242
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,151
Two people there's NFL quarterback research scientist

243
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
121

244
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,503
Comparison

245
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
So sick and tired of us doing these episodes that have

246
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Too much about this coronavirus stop

247
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
Don't very desperate on Alex's

248
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Is Bart you can just see

249
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,583
Like how badly he wants this to be like a narrative that blossoms for him and

250
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
It's just not how I'm very tired of it it's not

251
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
But In that clip Alex does bring up two things that I think deserve it

252
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,079
The first is that scientific paper that he mentioned and the second is 0 hat

253
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
So on January 31st 2020

254
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
2020

255
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Researchers at the Indian

256
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Betutu technology in New Delhi published a paper on a website called biorxiv titled

257
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,511
Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019 novel coronavirus Spike

258
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Protein

259
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
To hiv-1

260
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Gp120 and gag

261
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
One thing that's important to point out which Alex and Mike Adams seem to not want to discuss

262
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,079
Is what this website Bart biorxiv actually is

263
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
It's a preprint server

264
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
We're researchers and scientists compose papers that have not been vetted in

265
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
In any way

266
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
The issues the peer-review ain't can be a long process

267
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,391
That's where reputable Journal is unwilling to publish something without really going over

268
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Make sure the weather

269
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Their standards

270
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
That's weird

271
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Preprint servers can come in handy

272
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
From biorxiv website

273
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Quote

274
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Because this process can be lengthy

275
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,519
Authors use the biorxiv service to make their manuscripts available as pre pre

276
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Before completing peer-review

277
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Inconsequence service

278
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Application by a journal

279
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
This allows other scientist to see discuss and comment on the findings of media

280
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,367
Readers should therefore be aware that articles on biorxiv I have not been finalized by authors

281
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
May contain errors

282
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
And Reporting

283
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Information that has not been yet

284
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
Accepted

285
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
In any way by scientific or medical

286
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,935
This paper that Alex is citing his prestigious was in no way verified and even according to its source

287
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
Should not be taken as a finalized version of anything

288
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Also

289
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
If you try to find this paper now you find this message

290
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Quote

291
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
This paper has been withdrawn by its author

292
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
They intend to revise it in response to comments

293
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
Receive from the research community on their technical approach

294
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
And their interpretation of results

295
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
They retracted their paper on Sunday

296
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
The same day that Alex is on air talk about it being a Smoking Gun

297
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Diprove

298
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
This virus is a bioweapon

299
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
So to sum it up Oz primary service here is a paper that was

300
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
Attracted by its own authors after being

301
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
Published on Enon. View preprint server

302
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Put it simply

303
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,823
This is not strong enough to support any of

304
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
The claims that he's trying to make

305
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
They should not allow

306
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Non-scientist anywhere near that

307
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Like you journalists should be allowed to go near it

308
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Alex should be nowhere

309
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
Alex didn't even know it existed and if he does look at it

310
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
They should be like an Emmy

311
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Menin black like neuralyzer that

312
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,887
Wiped his memory I don't disagree that it is the sort of thing they could easily and you can see the exact

313
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Instance of a kitties alili

314
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Lead to trouble but what years

315
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
Suggesting would be just as bad there's a cover-up

316
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
That's not the point is they can't have

317
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
They when they have this information they're just

318
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
They're just awful with

319
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,415
Ignore the caveat in the astric of like this is not in any way substantiated

320
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Something's it's these research

321
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Searchers are putting up

322
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
For discussion within the medical and scientific research

323
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Community

324
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
It's just

325
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
You can't run with it like

326
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Alex is trying to run

327
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
Server is we're putting up

328
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Stuff for other scientists

329
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
To look at

330
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Cuz we're fairly certain

331
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
That there's going to be something that we can make

332
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Make better

333
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Never

334
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,391
Particularly the danger is this game too is that because there was a lot of backlash

335
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
From the scientific and medical community about the way they were framing things IV results that they were claiming

336
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
To have received

337
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,935
Voluntarily withdrew their own paper because of this

338
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,031
Critique and comments that the guy from the the community

339
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
Now Alex can claim that they took it down because it's a cover-up

340
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
It's

341
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
It is all just

342
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Disgraceful shell game

343
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Instead of the scientific Community doing

344
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,879
Job and self-policing to a very high quality standards

345
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Instead it's a conspiracy

346
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Cover up

347
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Bingo

348
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
As for the situation with zerohedge and as nothing

349
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
To do with

350
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
This paper from India

351
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Alex is trying to conflate

352
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
The two because

353
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
The BuzzFeed article about zerohedge getting kicked off Twitter

354
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Which is what everyone

355
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Alex is mad about you

356
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
That article mentioned

357
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
That zerohedge should work with an Indian

358
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Theory website called greatgameindia

359
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,319
Push narratives about the coronavirus being stolen from a Canadian lab in Winnipeg

360
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
That's the only connection to India but it

361
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
It's enough for Alex

362
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
To pretend that these are related

363
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
It's stories

364
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
So what happened is that zerohedge

365
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,583
Published an article accusing of virologist in Wuhan of creating the virus

366
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Andy posted his name email address and phone

367
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
And your dog

368
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Also said

369
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,823
Quote if anyone wants to find out what really caused the coronavirus pandemic

370
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,943
Infected thousands of people in China and around the globe they should probably pay him a visit

371
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
No no no you say if anybody wants

372
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
To find out that information

373
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Stop check Outback

374
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Do

375
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
Look at this time

376
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
That's just completely unacceptable Behavior has no evidence of this guy created the coronavirus and yet they're making

377
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
That accusation into

378
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
Suggesting people should go pay

379
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Pay him a visit

380
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,983
You can't do stuff like that and if I were Twitter I would have kicked them off the platform for that too

381
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
Granted I probably would have done it a long time ago but let's not split hairs NFL quarterback there

382
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Are public figures

383
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,527
Researchers literally no one has ever heard of before

384
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Posting a paper the

385
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Public figure

386
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,439
So I got into that and I'm like I'm not doing another episode

387
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Alex and Mike

388
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
Trying to sell food buckets and weird silver with fears about this virus

389
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Alex's

390
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Glitchy audio

391
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Yeah I just can't do it

392
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
I was not in for it I

393
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,591
Prime to myself for some sort of a political thing is like

394
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
I'm not in the mood I feel like the audio

395
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Probably getting

396
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
I'm sick and tired of Alex's lies about the virus

397
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
So I

398
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
What can I do what

399
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Can we do

400
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Iowa caucus

401
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
I think it to myself

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
One of Alex's finest MoMA

403
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Involves the Iowa caucus

404
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,607
Okay cuz back in 2012 Ron Paul was running

405
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Pretty well

406
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
In the Iowa caucus

407
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
He had came in third and votes yeah but he ended up getting

408
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
22 out of

409
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
The 20s

410
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
8 delegates

411
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,015
Oh that's right because Iowa should be removed from democracy

412
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
I'm not I'm not

413
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Yeah you got 22 out of the 28.

414
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
I'm not sure if I agree with you that I was should be removed from

415
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Democracy but

416
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
The the

417
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,535
Caucus system involves

418
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Places where manipulation

419
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
Can can be done by I think it might be

420
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
An undemocratic way of calling about

421
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses in 2012

422
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
If you want the votes

423
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
Of the people who showed up at the Iowa caucuses

424
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
And I got

425
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
0

426
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Pizza

427
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Probably going to be something kind of

428
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
So I went back to the day of the Iowa caucus

429
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Switches January 3rd

430
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
2012

431
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
And what'd you find

432
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Wow

433
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
You find Alex being very insistent the Ron Paul is going to win but

434
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Is also going to be screwed over

435
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
And

436
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
An interview

437
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
With Wayne Paul

438
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Senators passed the Fed

439
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,975
So we got a little bit of episode and then an interview with Wayne

440
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Call

441
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
I don't know

442
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,887
This episode by be completely pointless

443
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
But hey it's Iowa caucus time

444
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
Go ahead and listen to Alex's Iowa caucus

445
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
In 2012 when he had a feeling

446
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
The Ron Paul probably had a chance

447
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
It winning

448
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
The nomination should be president

449
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
Obama's ass everybody was going to choose Ron Paul over Obama totally so here we go

450
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
We start off with Alex

451
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Extolling the virtues

452
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
And

453
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
Did you know what is you

454
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,583
If you don't like Ron Paul Alex has some words

455
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
You don't like Ron Paul

456
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
You don't like

457
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
What America is

458
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,591
Imran Paula myself are

459
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Vipers

460
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Republic

461
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Anywhere signed onto the New World Order

462
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
.

463
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
Putting it pretty strongly

464
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
If you like America you better like Ron Paul

465
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
So let's see some like us

466
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Vipers

467
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
Nationally Ron Paul with polling

468
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
Between 8 and 12% of Broadway Providence roughly 90% of the United

469
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
I'd say it was 100%

470
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Globalist

471
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Snake Viper

472
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Agree

473
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,759
I did I don't have a ton of like the rest of this episode cuz they

474
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Who gives a s***

475
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
But Alex says take some calls

476
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Amy gets a call from a guy was nothing

477
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
The Iowa caucus

478
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Yes but I found this

479
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Be very interest

480
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
Thank you welcome

481
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Are you there

482
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Okay

483
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Find your listener

484
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,288
I'm calling cuz I need your help I'm I'm in the process of declaring myself a free man

485
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
On the land

486
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
I would have the Social Security

487
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
System

488
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
Number

489
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
If you accept that number to your name that's what ties you legally

490
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
They said they don't even follow their own rules just like

491
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Gotten rid of due process and say they'll secretly arrest you and blow your head off

492
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Darrell Wallace Criminal

493
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,984
But just because you say I'm a sovereign you pull out of it

494
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Unless you're an illegal alien they won't leave you alone about the law because they're here to drive down wages

495
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,784
Sure see you thought this was going to be a thing where Alex reveals he believes sovereign

496
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
Turns out also

497
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
Swerves at the end to race

498
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
I think it's funny that he

499
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,816
He's gone he's he's against Sovereign citizens doing their bulshit

500
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
From the other side like a garlic pickle

501
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,984
Absolutely everything

502
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
True but it doesn't matter if they're going to find you anywhere there's a practical aspect

503
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
As opposed to the magical thinking of

504
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
What's my social security number I'm a free man on the follow the law

505
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
Of course you could

506
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Would just be a man on the lamp

507
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
So Alex's pretty Sovereign citizen

508
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Of course

509
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
That's true sir

510
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
That was that's a weird response that kind of call

511
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
School

512
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,496
So if you get around to the Dwayne Paul interview and here's Alex giving him a little bit of an

513
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Intro witch

514
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Like you can really tell their seams

515
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
To be a talk

516
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,896
Talking point that Alex really seems to be pushing back on

517
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,224
You think you'll be able to tell what it is

518
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
He's a CPA

519
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,520
He just a chip off the same block Tron Paul came from the same tree

520
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,592
And I wanted to get him on today

521
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,224
To talk a little bit about his brother who is Brother really yes

522
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
Volunteer for free

523
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Cherry hospital

524
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,696
The pre-market you're supposed to have people to dedicate the wrong time

525
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Willingly

526
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
To help those that are in need the Bible teaches

527
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
I don't know that Ron Paul Regina

528
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
German campaign from others

529
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
Volunteer in the minority of black

530
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Areas mainly in

531
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,528
Hero

532
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,648
If you want to wow it because it's painful

533
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Because he knows he's doing his duty

534
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,768
There's a little bit of a concern about Ron Paul's

535
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,400
Rapunzel racing

536
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,472
I was coming up for president

537
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
People that

538
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:47,616
People that say APA research people dig into your newsletters

539
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Really racist

540
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Find associations with your no

541
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
Nazis and white supremacist

542
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
From the past

543
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
Did you find

544
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,416
What's up with this David Duke really loves you what's going on

545
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
I know certain things

546
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Dialects

547
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
I feel like you're one of the things that he really wants to drive home is like Ron Paul when he was a doctor love to give free help

548
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,264
Healthcare to black people clubs in but that's why he was giving free healthcare to Black

549
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,872
It comes up multiple times

550
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Yeah in this this interview

551
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Searchers are used to like

552
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Digging for Stuff

553
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,624
And with rampal they were they put their shovel down put the foot on there when click

554
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
We didn't even have to go.

555
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Not too deep

556
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
So I'm not positive what Alex is talking about when he says that Wayne Paul fought the IRS in court but

557
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
EPA

558
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,240
He actually has seen that on some

559
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Particular

560
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
But

561
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
I did find a little gem

562
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
About a lawsuit and the IRS

563
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm going to go to the Lost

564
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
But it wasn't Court

565
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
That involve Dwayne Paul

566
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
So in 2009 when Paul was called as a

567
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,160
The defense witness in the trial of a man named Robert who was accused of skirting

568
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Tax laws

569
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:10,816
So it seems that the situation was that he was paying his employees with gold and silver clef

570
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
And people who had like contract to it. He was only reporting their pay as buffets

571
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Ace value of the coin

572
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,640
For instance he might pay someone with a gold dollar coin that was valued at $200

573
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,736
But he was claiming it as $1

574
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Text Mom

575
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
That might sound like a small thing

576
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
And it probably would be if you're just doing it with one coin

577
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Was super rich

578
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Apparently he was doing it a lot

579
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Ultimately found guilty

580
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Use facing a possible sign of

581
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
14 million dollars

582
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
Would you give you some kind of scope

583
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,032
Of what kind of money you was hiding from the IRS with this key

584
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:57,152
Soca reggae would ultimately end up being sentenced to 190 months in prison

585
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
Love it

586
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
HP Pavilion

587
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
In restitution for the

588
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
First time I've heard the criminal justice system working right

589
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,904
I think it did take awhile though it was a drawn-out process

590
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
One of his advisors

591
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
Alexander lolkhalia was also sentenced

592
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
26 months in prison

593
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Because this involved

594
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
A bit of a conspiracy

595
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
That'll have

596
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
That'll happen so you bring in Wayne Paul as your defense

597
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,848
Interesting Lee log Leah was also a tease guy who is part of Bill Cooper's

598
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,200
Taji organization citizens Agency for joint intelligence

599
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,016
Bill Cooper sale multiple times

600
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
What are these

601
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
Defense witness in that case which did not go well for the dude that he was

602
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Supporting

603
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
Iavarone Paulding like I said volunteering as a doctorate that's great

604
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
But I don't know how much I believe that you super concerned with minority

605
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
He's getting a proper

606
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
The stupid was published

607
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Newsletter was written

608
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
BabyFirst

609
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Person who had I it was

610
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,640
Personal opinion of politicians

611
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
We'll go straight there books

612
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
Sure

613
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Cherry dick

614
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
So when Paul comes in

615
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Am I handsome

616
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Concerns about the transparency issues

617
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
You know like

618
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
I think it's a legitimate concern

619
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
And

620
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
When Paul has a solution

621
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
What is first

622
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
On your radar screen here today my friend

623
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
How do we know we're going at

624
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Are bananas

625
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,272
Long time

626
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Website

627
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Transparent

628
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Dotnet

629
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
Precinct 1

630
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Put it up and you

631
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
A picture of it

632
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
With your iPhone and

633
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
Transparent

634
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
This guy sounds

635
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Transparent boat.net

636
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Shaky voice

637
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
Old camera photo

638
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
It doesn't seem like the worst baby on the world although I think that the photos that people are sending in should be vetted

639
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
Before they accepted as being real

640
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
Like I I think that the process could become free

641
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Pretty complicated I don't know if the people who are running that website have the infrastructure or ability to handle that sort of thing

642
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,832
It's the same thing that I thought when I was listening to people call into shows last night as we're going his last night during

643
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Iowa coverage

644
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
From this year

645
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Are people calling in with Tally's

646
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
From caucuses

647
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't have any reason to distrust them necessarily

648
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
I also have no idea what they're saying is a cure

649
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
Just a person on a phone in the same way this is just a picture you could make that picture and the possibilities

650
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Need verification

651
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Stop

652
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
Baseline idea behind this person with this website

653
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Liverwurst ideas

654
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
Anyway I don't think this website took off

655
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
The earliest snapshot of it in the way-back machine

656
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
Gina's from early 2030

657
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
So that after this

658
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Did not stick around for very long

659
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Affair and by that point in early 2013

660
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
It already become a landing page with Spam in Japanese

661
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Promoting a shop

662
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,656
In Japan the text that you will find on transparent

663
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,264
There's a sex shop that you always visit when you come to Osaka

664
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
The sex shop does not offer any special services

665
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Especially notable

666
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
And not even

667
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Thrilling business

668
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
It's a very ordinary sex shop with the image of

669
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
General sex shop

670
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
Especially Osaka this is special

671
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
There is no complaint to sing

672
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,416
However I'm worried and I go every time I come to Osaka

673
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
It's such a mysterious shop

674
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
It's not that I'm messing around rather praise

675
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
I'm going to praise it like this

676
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
I think it is just you want to visit

677
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
However why is it so attractive

678
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
I don't know well

679
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
And as I said

680
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
Go to Osaka again this weekend

681
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Even so

682
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
I guess I would go to that site

683
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
I guess that is simple and cute girl smiles

684
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
The goes to the store

685
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
It says have you come I'm glad

686
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
Okay is this sex shop is synecdoche for the United States electoral system is that what's going on

687
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
Cuz I can see a little bit of it there

688
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
There's another page

689
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
Not just the landing homepage

690
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Another page titled quote

691
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Mentu

692
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Which begin

693
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Quote

694
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
This was also taught at the sex shop in Osaka

695
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
But man also squirt

696
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Okay

697
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:47,200
All right interesting okay tomorrow I looked into the pages on this website the more it became clear that this was largely about a sex

698
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,040
Shopping Osaka not focus on prostate orgasm

699
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,672
There's a page titled quote I liked it! At the Goodwood quote

700
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Yes yes

701
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
The prostate is something only we have

702
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
It seems to be about 5

703
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
The hole in the ass

704
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
What's happening here are these are these reviews communicating with each other it is said that if you stimulate if you will get pleasure

705
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Almost forever

706
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Almost

707
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,480
Bottom line is I guess that this transparent voting initiative didn't take off the way Wayne Paul helped my feet

708
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,576
Because I wanted to try and sort out what this website was like I was hoping to find some sort of

709
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,416
Japanese anus

710
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Sex shop

711
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
So thanks for that

712
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,304
Sometimes you set up the website that you think you want

713
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
But you find out you get the website

714
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,192
Paul was really that's what he need

715
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah so that's a baby that has nothing to do with

716
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Anything

717
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
Relevant at all but it's what you like you would look at the Wayback machine

718
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Transparent

719
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
I did not.

720
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,296
So one of the things I found really interesting about listening

721
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
Into this interview with Wayne

722
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
Saint Paul on the day of the Iowa caucus

723
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Lexus 2012

724
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,280
Firstly is it always does seem to be subtly pushing back on the idea that Ron Paul is racist

725
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
I'm on the second thing is

726
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
How much does

727
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Directly mirrors

728
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
So much of his language about

729
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,800
Imagine your brother really for 40 years but prominently for three decades

730
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
Traveling the country writing books of Congress

731
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Battling for basic

732
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Americana Liberty

733
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Constitution

734
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
And now here he is right is everything he warned of and you and I and many others and a griffin

735
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
Why does it all happening Justice League

736
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Sad

737
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,448
There is Ron Paul and that's God giving us a chance she'll God if you study the Bible

738
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
A way out a chance

739
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
This is so similar to

740
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
So how he like really

741
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Tried to characterize the

742
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
The 2016

743
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
The god giving us a

744
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Free like Nineveh

745
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
Constantly

746
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Absolutely

747
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,512
This it's startling to me almost to look back and see

748
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
What in in

749
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
View contacts

750
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
Could seem as a little bit more rational

751
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
I mean for all Ron Paul's faulted

752
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
At least he's a

753
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Politician

754
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
Who's been elected to office Multan

755
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
We'll try and who seems to believe what he says

756
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Sure

757
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,200
As good or bad as those things exactly have

758
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Like

759
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Not just f****** around

760
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Do you see the same

761
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
Sorta framing

762
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
In the same

763
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
It just it was very jarring

764
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah I don't know I don't know if anyone else so

765
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
Have a similar response

766
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Seen that language

767
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Biso

768
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,400
Vigorously applied to the truck

769
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Situation

770
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
A man looking back

771
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
It's exactly the same way here

772
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
You tried to frame the 2012 like

773
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
Really just makes everything seem

774
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Wait cheaper

775
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Like it makes

776
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
The 2012

777
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Stop saying cheaper and it makes the 20s

778
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
16 things to seem like this is what he does

779
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Yeah yeah

780
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
I mean

781
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,648
But he didn't do that obviously for Romney or the bushes

782
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
So

783
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
Probably

784
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,328
It seems to me like 2016 with something that is ruining 2012

785
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,936
Just doesn't have any other way of will cuz he had a candidate that made it out of the primary

786
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
And one that you like

787
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Yeah apposite

788
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah

789
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Flower f*****

790
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
That's weird

791
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,664
There's also the same thing with Trump I mean I guess like

792
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,736
You could get that even from that last like we're getting

793
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
God gives us

794
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
Icu2 I like it needs to be now

795
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
We live in the most

796
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Starting times

797
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
Because if we never have enough

798
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,328
Like this in my lifetime

799
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
We here

800
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
I think it's

801
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Fighting tickets

802
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
It is

803
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Going to be

804
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Something bad

805
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
Surprise everybody because the time is now

806
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Okay

807
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,424
Do not do this I don't know why that happened

808
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,056
I don't know whatever Wayne Paul says The Time Is Now John Cena's theme song that starts playing

809
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
I didn't do that are you anything you had

810
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
No it's just something that really absolutely

811
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Of course I had admitted

812
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,088
But it's important whenever anybody says the time is now you need

813
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Okay

814
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,184
That's how much

815
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
I told little you could find today

816
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
Go to the actual episode

817
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,680
You would have threw the f*** out with

818
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,496
Open me like I did it's a representation of how little I

819
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
Respect I have for Whitehall

820
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Probably

821
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
We are living in a

822
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
Exciting times because

823
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Fake teeth

824
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
Well I mean beer again

825
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,552
You have you know we're living in the most exciting time and it's

826
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
There's just so much a ring

827
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
What would end up being exactly the way that Alex

828
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
I talks about Trump

829
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
So

830
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
An interesting thing is here

831
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
You got

832
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Alex Jones

833
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Who does Adam Schiff

834
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
And you have him supporting a candidate

835
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Who has

836
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
A fair shot of coming in the top

837
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
End of the field

838
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
And

839
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,408
The first caucus of the primary Clinic

840
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
So it's so bizarre that Percival he chooses to have

841
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
As a guest

842
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
That candidates brother

843
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
No there's no,

844
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Flick of interest there

845
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
First of all there is

846
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
Play Penis music

847
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Second of all it just seems like

848
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
I don't know what

849
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
What you hoped

850
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
To get out of this other than maybe pay

851
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
You know like I know I can't imagine

852
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
If you have a

853
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Like I wouldn't

854
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,384
You'll be bizarre to me for like

855
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
I don't know

856
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,992
Madout2 have Hillary Clinton's Brother on

857
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Or something like that and think it's like

858
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Hard-hitting

859
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,880
Yeah yeah Iowa caucus

860
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
It just seems like

861
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
I don't get it

862
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
I don't get I get to choice

863
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Right but it's not a serious

864
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
No choice

865
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,264
Well I mean there's a reason that I don't remember making all the interview rounds on Nash

866
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,360
No TV I don't think Grandpa would like you went on Rush

867
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:44,224
Bring me John Fox News you're my surrogate for this interview we got to get Wayne out front

868
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
But it seems really weird and in because

869
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
When Paul doesn't really have much

870
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
By way of

871
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Being a surrogate

872
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,232
Haven't much relevancy to Ron Paul's campaign

873
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
It ends up drifting

874
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
Into Alex trying to talk about their childhood

875
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Where's the puppy

876
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Would you like

877
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
Growing up with Ron Paul

878
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
You guys have a large family growing up

879
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,384
How would you characterize him in the family

880
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,224
And then he forgot his life what type of person is Ron Paul

881
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,344
What do you make of all of these yeah and I'm taking out of tens of thousands of newsletters

882
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
I taking an option lines or something

883
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
Conflating them with other things

884
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
And then attacking your brother

885
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:33,376
So there's two things that are going on here one again you see this interest in pushing back again

886
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,936
Against the racist narrative cuz that's what he's talking about

887
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
The newsletters

888
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
I meant secondarily I

889
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
This strategy is I don't even know if it's

890
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
Conscious strategy

891
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
Just how someone like

892
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Opera

893
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
This is about endearing

894
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Ron Paul further

895
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
By way of story

896
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Like because

897
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
Broadleaf

898
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
Going to get into the nitty-gritty of policy

899
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Or anything like that

900
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,976
The way you're going to end up doing is making stories surrounding

901
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
His Canada

902
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
That is the most important

903
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
Elements too appealing to this

904
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Those right-wing base

905
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Yeah you need an emotion

906
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
P0land that's going

907
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Going to do a lot of work

908
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,152
Problem is everybody was listening to our to show already loves Ron Paul so I don't know who you are

909
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Hoping to swing

910
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,528
Bye-bye way of like what was it like growing up with Lompoc give us

911
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Character that we can all relate to in

912
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Attach ourselves to

913
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
You're selling a sold car

914
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
That's what you're doing it just

915
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Now about those newsletter

916
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,400
The racist and Ron Paul's newsletter is were absolutely not taken out of context and it's not just a

917
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,752
Couple line 12 lines in your conflating them with false information

918
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
What kind of

919
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Idiot

920
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,896
Take only a few lines out of context and then conflate them with

921
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,968
Play different things that would be insane

922
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
There's a great

923
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
He's about this in the new Republic by James Croce

924
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,112
Check the gets into some of the more frog

925
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Example

926
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
A Ron Paul being a gigantic raises

927
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Princeton

928
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
1992 article about the w

929
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:12,704
Order was only restored in La when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare check okay

930
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,544
The piece also applauded the Korean store owners who are quote the only

931
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
People to act like real America

932
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,968
Mainly because they have not yet been assimilated into our rotten liberal culture which admonishes White

933
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
Face by raging blacks to lie back in

934
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
Think of England

935
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
Now that one is going to be tough to

936
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Explain away

937
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,208
Yeah I think that one is pretty comprehensive in being racist

938
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
For there was the 1989 article that predicted racial violence will fill our cities because quote

939
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Mostly black welfare recipients

940
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
Will feel justified in stealing from the most

941
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
Ugly white Ave

942
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
All car all right there's a June 1991 article about racial tension in a DC neighborhood titled quote

943
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
Animals take over the DC zoo

944
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Okay

945
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Nope nope

946
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,855
There's a singular fixation in his newsletters about the coming race war and a trend

947
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
Calling non-whites animals

948
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,231
In an article from 1990 to the newsletter says quote

949
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,559
Everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self-defense

950
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
For the animals are coming

951
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167
There was one for 1996 that opine

952
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,727
Find the quote opinion polls consistently show that only

953
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,287
Only 5% of blacks have sensible political

954
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
The newsletters called the end of Apartheid in South Africa a quote

955
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
Destruction of civilization

956
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,759
I quote the most tragic event to ever occur on that continent

957
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
At least below the sea

958
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Sahara

959
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Why is it

960
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,879
So many of these right-wing figures

961
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Steam to take

962
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
The exact same view of the world

963
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Charles Mann

964
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,583
Why is there so much overlap between

965
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Manson breach

966
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
I don't know

967
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,727
Or who could forget about all the positive coverage of the newsletters gave to David Duke

968
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
Back in 1991 saying quote

969
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,615
Duke lost the election but he scared the blazes out of the established

970
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,991
All this makes sense I mean after all Duke didn't endorse Ron Paul for president

971
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,039
Is it pretty much all of the white supremacist

972
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,111
Community in the country that has any interest in electoral politics

973
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,671
Unless they're trying to become men of the

974
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Plato care about electoral politics

975
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,839
This is very serious and very consistent

976
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
What type of ship

977
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,679
It goes on even getting into the gay bashing a

978
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
Completely nonsensical revisionist

979
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
History and

980
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Anti-communist

981
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Conspiracy s*** in those news

982
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,407
Ron Paul is not a folksy weirdo hates Banks and Lauren loves we

983
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,991
He's either of violently racist person who had no problem expressing

984
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Brett Sanders views

985
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
Is it is newsletter incompetent

986
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Allowed someone else

987
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
To write violently racist articles in his newsletter in the first-person and somehow we didn't notice until he was asked

988
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
About it when he ran for

989
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
Such b*******

990
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
This is this is sad

991
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,191
And like yeah go ahead ask Wayne Paul

992
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
About it

993
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Ask his

994
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Brother

995
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,847
Buddhist like growing up with Ron Paul

996
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
You do

997
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
Racist another Children of the

998
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,575
Wait wait doesn't even respond to the newsletter

999
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Stop

1000
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Assertive waxes

1001
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
Nostalgic about a bygone time

1002
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,743
Alex tries to read

1003
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
Dot-dot-dot

1004
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
Alex tries to refocus him on like how would you

1005
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
Scribe Ron

1006
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
How would you describe

1007
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
Ron Paul

1008
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
What drives your brother

1009
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
High School

1010
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
Store

1011
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Making

1012
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Keep in mind

1013
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
Ron Paul was born in 90

1014
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
1835

1015
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
He's currently 84 years old

1016
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,591
He was a child during World War II

1017
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,919
This quaint picture that Wayne is painting sounds like

1018
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
I-24 into modern years maybe

1019
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
But it's super common

1020
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Among people who were born in the 30

1021
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Oh yeah

1022
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Why would they how would they

1023
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
They even get jobs

1024
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Do you know how hard the job market is

1025
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
Now I assume it's exactly the same whenever most of

1026
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
The male population

1027
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
Is going in fighting a war over

1028
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
He talks about like paying his own way through college

1029
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
It's like yeah

1030
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
College constantly

1031
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
Hundred dollars

1032
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Station.

1033
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:38,175
I used to I paid for my college off for years and when I walked out I didn't have any debt

1034
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,991
How much did you pay for Colin

1035
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
$2,000 is a nice day

1036
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Do you know how much

1037
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
So

1038
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
It's not really a dress

1039
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
So much

1040
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,351
You know Alex keeps bringing up the like thing

1041
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Better serve

1042
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
Geared towards the like everyone saying Ron's erases

1043
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,775
But it's not really addressed all that much

1044
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
It's just like

1045
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
Pushed back on without really

1046
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
Without Really dealing with what the

1047
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
The complaints are

1048
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,551
Consistently false claims

1049
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,367
I know that you know your brother well

1050
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Well

1051
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
EBay

1052
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
American money

1053
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,407
I made an agreement to get paid

1054
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,503
Never

1055
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
Medicare

1056
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Anytime

1057
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Being a duck

1058
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
That's right never took it and many cases

1059
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
Or just give people free healthcare

1060
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
What

1061
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
I mean most doctors would just turn you away right there

1062
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Oh really your brother

1063
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,223
Understands the issues and that's why the system so scared of him

1064
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
Because they know

1065
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
He can't be bought

1066
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
And there's no skeletons in his closet

1067
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
Same thing that Alex says about Trump

1068
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Ikea's you can't be bought

1069
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
There's no skeletons in the closet

1070
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,327
Massive amounts of skeleton good both of their closet

1071
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Skeleton

1072
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,703
There specific specifically closet built for Scarlett

1073
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,567
Yeah yeah they hang them up very nicely

1074
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Full of sky

1075
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,479
And also there's a big difference between with Alex's presenting like you gave people free healthcare and

1076
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
What Wayne is

1077
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
Describing which is like

1078
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
You work under the table we work out a deal where you can pay me so I don't have to go through the administrative bulshit

1079
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:03,071
Medicare whatever select different

1080
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
So how about you give me a

1081
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,191
A gold coin worth $200 and we'll call it 1.

1082
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
That's

1083
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
Whatever whatever Wayne is describing is

1084
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,639
Quaint and I don't know the legality of

1085
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
I don't know the thing

1086
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
The details of half

1087
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,759
If you can or can't do that or you should or shouldn't

1088
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
What are the ramifications of it

1089
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
But that's not giving people free healthcare

1090
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
Whatever's going on is f***** up

1091
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
The quote minority

1092
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,119
I'm back on this thing it would buy by using this as a way of being like he can't be right

1093
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,911
He gave Healthcare to Maita quote

1094
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Minority

1095
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Leah VI

1096
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
DIA

1097
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
Beds

1098
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Other places

1099
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
Would turn away

1100
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
Black patient

1101
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
But Ron Paul

1102
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
Hero

1103
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Of the minority community

1104
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Is the only one who will

1105
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
I think you wouldn't be a f***

1106
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,575
In fairness I think what he was talking about Maurice

1107
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
Specifically was people who couldn't

1108
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
You know it

1109
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Nmd

1110
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,975
Alex was saying it was largely in quote

1111
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,839
Minority Turning Away people at hospitals

1112
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
Not paying.

1113
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Alex is

1114
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
Combining those two

1115
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
To make Ron Paul appear more virtue

1116
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Exactly

1117
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
So while at the same time demonizing

1118
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Black people for always be

1119
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
Well I mean it's

1120
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
He's read the newsletter

1121
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
Alex has a well-read man so

1122
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
So

1123
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,927
Paul is going into the Iowa

1124
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
And Wayne

1125
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
As unconcerned

1126
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
I'm at is the

1127
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
Certainly I mean that is a concern

1128
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,631
There's dirty

1129
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,935
Perhaps going on behind the scene

1130
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,775
It does show The Awakening is huge that despite the

1131
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,359
The line Decepticon media telling everybody

1132
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
Ron Paul can't win

1133
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
The front-runner

1134
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
And they're in full panic mode

1135
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,575
What are some of the dirty tricks are expecting them to peulwane

1136
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,719
The Caucus meeting tonight in Iowa

1137
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Because

1138
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
Big people in the

1139
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
In the individual

1140
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
The Grassroots

1141
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
Serious-minded

1142
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Individual

1143
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
Any one of the Canada

1144
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
They're normally

1145
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Fairies

1146
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
Dedicated hard-working

1147
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
Moving along way

1148
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Quicker

1149
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
I believe

1150
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
Precinct

1151
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
Numbers

1152
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
Will be honest

1153
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
In every way shape of

1154
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Michael

1155
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,007
Would be what happened

1156
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
One day go to 8

1157
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
Secret place

1158
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Transparency

1159
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
So it's

1160
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
It's it's fun

1161
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
This

1162
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
Concerned

1163
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,463
As you with that these sorts of issues

1164
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Primaries in Cox

1165
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Does butt

1166
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
It's interesting that he's talking

1167
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
Going about this

1168
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Is dirty trick

1169
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,423
But they're going to be going on at the Iowa caucus

1170
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Because there were dirty

1171
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
But

1172
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,663
There's something really interesting about the what happened with the Iowa caucus

1173
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
In 2012 and that was

1174
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,479
Mitt Romney

1175
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Was

1176
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,855
Everybody kind of thought God's Own favorite if somebody was going to take the Republican nomination

1177
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:43,743
People in the race like Gingrich had a little bit of Santorum

1178
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,047
Wasn't appealing candidate

1179
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
He's made of

1180
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
If you added November

1181
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
That Outsider Fringe

1182
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,495
Sting that the libertarian vibe

1183
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,847
There was a lot of there's a lot of things going on

1184
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,199
But Mitt Romney was seeing his up by most as being like the odds-on guy

1185
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
Mitt Romney was 2012

1186
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
He announced

1187
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
Prior to the caucus

1188
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
Even as far back as late-2011

1189
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
Mitt Romney announce he wasn't going to participate

1190
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
The Iowa straw poll

1191
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
And he seemed like he was taking pretty low into

1192
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
Identity approach

1193
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
The Iowa

1194
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
This is a whole lot of people like Ron Paul a big open

1195
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,191
To really hit the ground hard

1196
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
Try and get people out to the car

1197
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
So despite a fairly

1198
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,079
Meek attempted woman Iowa

1199
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,639
Initially declared the winner

1200
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Of the Iowa caucus

1201
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,247
Do you report what

1202
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Was that

1203
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
He beat Rick Santorum by 8 votes

1204
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
I was just kind of irrelevant because total supporters don't necessarily Translate

1205
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
The number of delegates

1206
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Cockatrice

1207
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Stupid

1208
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
I don't know if they're stupid but they're weird

1209
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
After the talleys recertify

1210
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,911
It turned out the Rick Santorum it actually beat Romney

1211
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
By 34

1212
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
But all those kind of mood

1213
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,031
Has Ron Paul won almost

1214
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
All of the states delegate

1215
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,175
Even though he was thirty-eight hundred votes behind either Ronnie or Santorum

1216
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
And he won how many of their delegates

1217
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
22 out of 28 okay

1218
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,855
And so that is nothing

1219
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
For what risk

1220
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:19,487
Who campaign was able to achieve this by manipulating the rules of how delegates work in caucus

1221
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,095
Okay delegates are elected but they're not bound to vote for the person who wins

1222
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
The state

1223
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
In this case santora

1224
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Because of this little quirk

1225
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
Post-campaign works

1226
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
Get his supporters in positions where they would be elected as delegate that came with every right to vote for whoever they want

1227
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:41,759
Due to this political maneuvering Ron Paul was

1228
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:47,903
Easily able to win 22 out of 28 elections up for grabs even though he came in service

1229
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
Milk people in there

1230
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,023
I don't know what Larry how much

1231
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,375
Like subterfuge went on and I was entirely sure like how much of it was

1232
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Actual like

1233
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,191
Nefarious

1234
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Stop

1235
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,871
Based on deterrent like the United that's not okay. Okay for the guy in third ticket

1236
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:12,735
What 80% or 70%

1237
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
As I look

1238
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
That

1239
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
I think

1240
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,855
That's not really cheating

1241
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
Backroom Bud Knox

1242
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,559
Comparing two kind of shady there's a there's a certain part of me that finds that a little bit Charming

1243
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,095
I'm not going to lie

1244
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
I mean yeah

1245
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,239
I don't I have I have mixed feelings about it cuz on the one hand it does mean that whoever was

1246
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Doing that

1247
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,311
That was definitely super motivated

1248
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
They were very into the

1249
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
The process they knew the rules

1250
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
Well but on the other

1251
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,503
It is subverting Will of people a little bit

1252
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
I mean there is

1253
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,831
So I don't know

1254
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
Waiting to be less concerned about the

1255
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
Strategy that appears Ron was using every time these guys say you better watch out for voter fraud

1256
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:03,679
On the other side it's because we're about to do some voter fraud on our I don't know how much rain is even aware of that

1257
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
Because quite frankly

1258
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
I don't know

1259
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
Yeah so

1260
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,615
We get back in this next clip to just like

1261
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Echoes

1262
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
Of

1263
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
And the way Alex souldrop like

1264
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,271
If you take the name wrong Paul out of here I think

1265
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,087
Probably sounds very similar to how Alex

1266
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
Talk about drama

1267
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
Once people convert to Liberty and put

1268
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
Together

1269
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
Understand how things work

1270
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,471
Ologies

1271
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:42,335
He's getting people to ReDiscover history ReDiscover common-sense ReDiscover

1272
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,223
The horrible stuff were being sold by the establishment

1273
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
It's the establishment

1274
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,319
It's got something to hide it's the establishment

1275
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
Discredited in cookies

1276
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
Not Ron Paul

1277
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
And every month

1278
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,975
We exponentially grow

1279
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,767
And that's why the system scared

1280
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Alex says everything

1281
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,863
Thing is exponential

1282
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,935
Sammy even said make her cook Freight

1283
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
You know

1284
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
I agree with that that to me

1285
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Is f***** up

1286
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Because

1287
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
That can't be a coincidence

1288
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
It's not his idea

1289
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
No they didn't get it

1290
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Fact that ends up being

1291
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Trump

1292
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Rallying slogan

1293
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:31,231
It's how he's talking about Ron Paul in 2012 it's just it's just weird there's so much

1294
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
I think it makes

1295
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
Based on what were

1296
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Experiencing right now

1297
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Now with Alex

1298
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
It's B

1299
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,679
This is the same problem that he's having

1300
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
On the truck

1301
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,263
He only has one way to sell a

1302
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,847
Right you got a million ways to try and tear down again

1303
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
He's only got one weight

1304
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
To sell

1305
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
So when Trump comes along it doesn't matter if it's true or not

1306
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,367
Selling Trump so he sells them like so if it's wrong

1307
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
It is it is

1308
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
One of the shortcomings

1309
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Douglas Park

1310
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
So far

1311
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
And like in terms of what we've list

1312
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Listen to

1313
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
Is that there hasn't been a ton of

1314
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Our coverage of

1315
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,519
How he promoted Ron Paul during those years

1316
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,335
Make me wonder if just this little glimpse of him talking

1317
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,175
Dwayne it makes me wonder how much like we could go back

1318
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,711
To the Ron Paul time

1319
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,503
And you're almost

1320
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
Direct parallels

1321
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
Of how Alex

1322
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Promoted

1323
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,439
Yeah I would be surprised if there was a way heavier overlap

1324
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Then why

1325
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:39,839
You would assume that well I would be interested now and just like going through each of the candidates since like

1326
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Like 2,000

1327
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
And finding

1328
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
If you pick

1329
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:51,103
Different ones at that time and told him the same way but that's all

1330
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,919
In 2016 it would have been Ron Paul but in

1331
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Instead it was ran

1332
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Don't know

1333
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
Did Ron Paul run in 2004

1334
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
You might

1335
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,135
I don't know I don't remember

1336
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
12 where his big

1337
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Big rotten

1338
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Yeah yeah

1339
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
Yeah I don't I don't know

1340
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
I don't know I think

1341
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
I think it's a surprise

1342
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
His big runs came against a black

1343
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
Weird it's almost like

1344
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
Certain people or more in

1345
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
You read the news

1346
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
So I

1347
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
There's another source

1348
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,151
Parallel here and that you hear that

1349
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,711
They've been able to control

1350
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Inspect

1351
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Somewhere

1352
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
Beer with him

1353
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
But those times are changed

1354
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,743
Day is it changes

1355
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,047
I am Groot

1356
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
Beer

1357
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
Life for he and his family

1358
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
You're right on the same page together

1359
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,991
So you have that same also that parallel look like Alex's

1360
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Pitching the

1361
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Crisis

1362
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,391
If Trump is like he's too popular at your death killer

1363
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:12,255
He can't be controlled and he knows they're going to kill him anyways but he

1364
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,839
Still doing it because he just believe so hard he's willing

1365
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,423
To divert

1366
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
I mean it

1367
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
It's almost shocking really to look

1368
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Get this would be like

1369
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Wow

1370
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
I guess that's what he does

1371
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
Yeah it's almost

1372
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,687
Copy and paste yeah it really is

1373
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
Very strange

1374
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
So again

1375
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,575
Wayne Paul is not like

1376
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,111
The guy who is Rollo

1377
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Brilliant accounting

1378
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
I wasn't asking about account

1379
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:44,255
Seems like that would be his his best interview

1380
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
Do his best shot is to ask

1381
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
What about when you work

1382
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
But get back more into this

1383
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,495
Started waking up to this whole new world order collectivist

1384
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:00,639
A slave system was it tell you was another brother was at Ron give us that more

1385
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
Well I think

1386
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
When was waiting for baby

1387
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,599
Read Austrian economics

1388
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,439
So he went all the way back

1389
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
Indiana Street

1390
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
Economics

1391
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,471
Which is free enterprise

1392
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
Private prep

1393
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,567
Liberty to do what you want

1394
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,871
You learned and understood

1395
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,711
Daughter last episode we talked about how the me since

1396
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,039
Institute believes you have the right to allow your child to die

1397
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:42,879
Because because forcing you to feed them as an infringement on your rights

1398
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
They are

1399
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,999
Ron Paul was there at the beginning

1400
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Got it from the store

1401
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,119
He read all of this Ludwig von mises s***

1402
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
And he went

1403
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
Buckwild

1404
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
While he was waiting for

1405
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:04,127
Baby I imagine he's standing there next to the woman just got his watch out and lost Rihanna

1406
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:10,527
This book I'm not obligated to help you give birth

1407
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,831
Forcing me

1408
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,623
To help you

1409
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,159
In your pregnancy is a

1410
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,975
Positive responsibility and an infringement on my right

1411
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,303
Wouldn't he be allowed to

1412
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,375
First ask for payment before he gives her the baby

1413
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,655
Probably I don't know

1414
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,495
I think so but we talked about that issue with the me since

1415
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:35,615
Institute on last episode but today I want to tell you about how they celebrated Chris

1416
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
Smith's 1998

1417
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
And that was by post

1418
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,271
An article defending Ebenezer Scrooge

1419
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,111
Alright guys we got this one

1420
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,903
So from the article

1421
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
The fact is

1422
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,047
Skills were worth more to anyone than the fifteen Shillings screwed pay is it weekly

1423
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,351
There would be someone glad to offer it to him

1424
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
Since no one has

1425
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Denton scratches

1426
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,727
Profit-maximizing boss is hardly a man to pay for nothing

1427
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Cratchit must

1428
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Be worth

1429
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
Exactly his present wages

1430
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,359
Sprite I don't think they got the

1431
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:11,199
The point of the story is I'm starting to think that there

1432
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
Their quibble isn't with dickon

1433
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,319
No scratch it needs

1434
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
I e w

1435
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:23,999
More to support his family and to care for Tiny Tim food but Scrooge did not

1436
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
For scratcher to father children he's having difficulty supporting children

1437
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Afford them he

1438
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,495
Not Scrooge is responsible for their plate

1439
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
There you go

1440
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,079
The math checks out

1441
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:42,175
You got to take responsibility for your actions homies Institute also take same

1442
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
Right at the ghost

1443
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
The Christmas Past what about

1444
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,551
What's the conditions at the time

1445
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:51,647
Definitely leading to Tiny Tim's series of ailment

1446
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
That wasn't his

1447
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
Joyce did he have a choice

1448
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,255
The live in London

1449
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
So but about to go ghost

1450
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
Christmas Past

1451
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,911
Scrooge's first employee are good old fezziwig was a bit

1452
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Free or with the guinea

1453
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
He throws his employees a Christmas

1454
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Miss party

1455
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,591
What the what the Ghost of Christmas Past does not explain is how physically

1456
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Weather for today

1457
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Did he attempt

1458
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,687
To pass the added costs on to his customers

1459
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:19,295
Or did Young Scrooge pay for it Anyway by working for marginal he's up or wages

1460
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,671
Guys are having fun to hang out with

1461
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,999
Clearly they f****** love everything's recruit

1462
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:33,631
Get me a beer your friendship is not valuable enough for one full beer I will get you 1/2

1463
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,703
About Scrooge it is at a closed

1464
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
The article

1465
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,775
There can be no arguing with Ditka

1466
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,847
Wish to show the spiritual advantages of love

1467
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:48,223
But there was no need to make the object of his lesson and entrepreneur whose ideas and practices

1468
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
Is benefit his employees at Large

1469
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
Adam cell

1470
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,927
Won't anybody think of the oligarchs than what anybody think of how very much

1471
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Real death

1472
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
These guys are real

1473
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
That's almost

1474
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
That Elvis has to be delivered trolling and I would believe that if they didn't believe everything that they're saying

1475
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,263
Stuff that I've read from that my do not believe this

1476
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
Stroller

1477
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,383
I think it's probably written with a little bit of a win

1478
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
But the wing

1479
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Is like

1480
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,527
I'm f****** with you it's like

1481
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,159
Look at this I'm I'm taking how I read this book better than you you dumb dumb

1482
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
That's the way

1483
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
Yats The Comedy of it

1484
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Sheetz

1485
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
I just

1486
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
I just admire

1487
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,167
That kind of certain like oh I'm going after this

1488
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,703
1 cherished

1489
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,263
Immortal story from everybody

1490
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
Easily gets the moral of

1491
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
Flip it on its head baby

1492
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
You guys don't have

1493
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
Still like a central problem

1494
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,271
With philosophies that put

1495
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,807
Private property as

1496
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
View top

1497
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Yeah the thing

1498
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
The highest priority

1499
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,927
I'm in secondarily

1500
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,999
Libertarianism is a real problem

1501
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
Wet because the non-aggression

1502
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,351
Principal the two Central to libertarian thought

1503
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Is incoherent

1504
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
And so trying to apply those

1505
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
Two things

1506
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,031
Like at and apply them to all sorts of Life situation

1507
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
You just end up with

1508
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
Nonsensical s*** like

1509
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
Scrooge was the real victim

1510
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,199
And you should be able to let your kids starve

1511
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
Great

1512
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,111
Let's let's follow our beliefs to their logical conclusion and all of our children

1513
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Starve to death okay

1514
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
I think we might be on

1515
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:39,071
Ron Paul read all that stuff decided here's a career that's what I got

1516
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
40 f****** years

1517
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:47,007
One lady had to wait he she was in labor for like 3 days you read all of the books and now he's sick of being a doctor

1518
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
So we know one thing

1519
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
A lot about Wayne Paul

1520
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Like

1521
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Defining

1522
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:59,295
I mean it's what you said as soon as you heard his name and that is what he believes that three people voted

1523
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
Federal Reserve

1524
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
Cuz he said that in Alex's.

1525
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Documentary

1526
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,207
And then it turns out he says it on the show

1527
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,535
You really does believe that he does

1528
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,423
Habitat for every person in the United

1529
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
Its face

1530
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Spider-Man

1531
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
App for route

1532
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
November

1533
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,783
1913 Federal Reserve

1534
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Free People

1535
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,183
Saturdays

1536
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
We turn around and Roosevelt

1537
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,535
Bankrupt

1538
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Yep

1539
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Yep yep

1540
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
I mean that's just lunacy

1541
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,423
There's no other way to put it is it like

1542
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
So easy

1543
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
To show that that is not

1544
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
True

1545
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,847
You're being deliberately out

1546
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
To see if you continue to believe

1547
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,687
I don't know I don't know I think he's just

1548
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Like

1549
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
Maybe old

1550
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
And

1551
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Dumb

1552
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
That could be all

1553
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,951
I worry about the Paul family you think so I don't know I don't know their other sibling

1554
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
But the two of them are not a good example of

1555
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
I like really well-thought-out

1556
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Position

1557
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
Like if I were wrong

1558
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
I would be like Wayne

1559
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
Don't go on Infowars

1560
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,055
Don't say that three people voted in the Federal Reserve

1561
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,615
That looks bad

1562
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,991
Just because I also believe it's true doesn't mean you want to say it in front of the normies

1563
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
It's very strange

1564
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,087
So is life clip we have it's Alex F

1565
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
Looking for closing

1566
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,439
Closing comments in the two minutes we got left her

1567
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,535
For the opportunity

1568
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:49,887
Be on the radio again want to reiterate we live in the most

1569
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
Exciting

1570
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
Kind of my life

1571
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,543
United

1572
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
It's going to change

1573
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Environment

1574
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
Change it

1575
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
And I think

1576
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,855
Every citizen of the United

1577
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,719
To an unbelievable

1578
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,023
Prosperity in this country

1579
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:22,911
If we turn around and understand what's going on and we fight for our Liberty

1580
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
It didn't

1581
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,311
I like the idea that he's saying that he's living in the most

1582
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,615
Exciting time of his life like he lived

1583
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,175
Through the

1584
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,735
Civil Rights era

1585
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,319
Vietnam

1586
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,135
It wasn't that good

1587
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,439
Holyshit

1588
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,487
The stuff that he lived through

1589
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:54,655
I wasn't paying attention I guess it would be really exciting on a subjective level for your brother to run for president again

1590
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Yeah

1591
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
But

1592
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
I don't know

1593
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,359
I don't know I don't know if I would consider the 2012 election

1594
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,383
To be the most

1595
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,783
Exciting time of the last 70 plus years

1596
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,135
But we've had in a long time

1597
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,927
But I do remember being very big

1598
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,207
No no

1599
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
Especially after the hole

1600
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
47% thing where is

1601
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
Romney

1602
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
Is Wayne still alive

1603
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
I have no idea

1604
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Well it cuz I was going to say

1605
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,591
If he's on the Grand Prix

1606
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
Man 2020

1607
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,711
The end of the world has already been declared by another guest on Infowars

1608
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,039
Over for Humanity

1609
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,623
I'm always at the ready for my lunch

1610
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,903
That's the most

1611
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
Exciting times really

1612
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:57,375
Yeah I don't know what Wayne Paul's up to is too easy a name to like a tube, Nate

1613
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:03,519
Angie's to low profile to really be relevant

1614
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
Also I don't care

1615
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,639
I agree with you

1616
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,943
It's a it's a really really

1617
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
Sing to me and I think that

1618
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
There's there is an interesting

1619
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,879
Element in that you have the anti-establishment

1620
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,903
Candidate

1621
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,439
In 2012 in the person

1622
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Ron Paul

1623
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
Coming into Iowa caucuses

1624
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,023
Which has a slight

1625
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
Mirror to the present day

1626
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,375
With the Democratic primary

1627
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,775
I think there's slight parallels but far more differences to make them analogous should I think that there is that that's really in

1628
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
Interesting and then further

1629
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
I think

1630
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
I'm

1631
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Overwhelmed

1632
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
By how similar this

1633
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
East Alex

1634
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
Speaking of Ron Paul to a bespoke

1635
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
About Donald Trump particularly in the lead-up

1636
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
That I was not expect

1637
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
Define

1638
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
And it makes me

1639
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,695
Kind of want to dig more

1640
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
That right Road the Ron Paul run

1641
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,327
The more I think about that that's the thing that makes the most sense

1642
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,679
Because I didn't consider but you're right

1643
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,727
The with the libertarian

1644
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:10,591
Nonsense people there's such a narrow view of what even a candidate they

1645
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,359
Could support

1646
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,431
Right you know so if you're trying to sell them any bud

1647
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,503
You have to sell them the same way that you sell rampal

1648
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
Lesbian you know and Trump

1649
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
Can fit some of those Bales but

1650
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,903
Why not just throw them all on there anyway

1651
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,207
Selam to Libertarians as Ron Paul

1652
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Even if he's not

1653
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,791
I just never really considered it for a number

1654
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Wonder

1655
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
So

1656
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,863
Ron Paul a.

1657
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
Yes

1658
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,471
And then second like Alex was already

1659
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,031
Trying to do those characterizations with Rand Paul

1660
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
Before he decided to flip

1661
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
So I never really Confederate point

1662
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,455
I never really considered how much like it just might be

1663
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,479
Bees

1664
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
Boilerplate

1665
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Way I Define

1666
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
Good candidate

1667
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Yeah

1668
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
It's it's

1669
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
It's interesting how like

1670
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
Even I

1671
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,743
Knowing what I know about Alex

1672
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
Give him

1673
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,815
Way too much credit for like

1674
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
Some kind of dab

1675
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
To what he's doing

1676
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,215
I got really I really need to probably get rid of some of

1677
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
It is it is

1678
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,031
Hard to

1679
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Because

1680
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,103
We listen to the lead-up though

1681
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
And hearing all of his b*******

1682
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
You just assumed that he

1683
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Created

1684
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
You know

1685
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,343
You assume that there was some sort of creative Alamo

1686
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,391
Do it because you would have to create drunk

1687
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,999
With you with drama but then you're like why would I assume that the least

1688
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Creative man

1689
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
Who does no research and does

1690
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Acknowledge

1691
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
Creative

1692
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
Yeah it's it seems like the most likely thing is

1693
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,335
I've done this I did this with Ron couple times

1694
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
Dial all my ramps

1695
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
It's all muscle memory

1696
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:56,063
It seems like it it's possible I don't know it in order to really be more certain of that it needs to go back and listen to a lot of two

1697
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
House made in 2012

1698
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,695
Which I may do maybe something for the future but for now it's

1699
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
Take this little glimpse

1700
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,255
Do Alex's

1701
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
Iowa caucus date

1702
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
2012

1703
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,143
In order to have something to talk about

1704
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,543
Our new research are our new research project is just going through every election to find out whether or not Alex

1705
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Support

1706
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
The candidate

1707
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,175
Describes it will not be there but you know

1708
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,247
It doesn't there's a little mini episode cuz Alex is

1709
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:30,111
Add some sort of mysterious vacation where he's gone for a couple days I've no idea what he's doing

1710
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,903
Aubrey came out of nowhere

1711
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:39,071
But if he's out of Studio on Wednesday and Thursday then

1712
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
I don't know what the fuc

1713
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,887
So we will see what happens

1714
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,959
Until you see we see you again

1715
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727

1716
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
Underscore fight not go to bed

1717
