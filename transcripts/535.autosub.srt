Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody around a little bit

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
Jones

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordans

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,032
Question what's up

10
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
People who listen to the park

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Podcast regularly eagle-eyed listeners will know

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Emoji certainly

13
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
The Forbidden Rice paddies unforbidden

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Not love

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Bookminders of vinegar

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Vinegar

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
I didn't know that you could maybe yours

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
Supposed to put vinegar in rice when you're cooking it

19
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,360
I did not know that either I don't know if you're supposed to put some people recommend that you do it

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,456
So I put some some vinegars

21
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,040
If not then with some rice I was cooking last night

22
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
Pretty good 22 great flavors that go great

23
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Together D up

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,720
100% certain that was

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
That much better

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
But

27
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Expelled

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
Like a garlic while it was cooking well that's fun

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
Yeah there's no problem there

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
It felt like I was doing

31
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Something

32
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
And that really counts for a lot

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,408
Cooking Alchemy is a good feeling

34
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,248
Yeah definitely so I had a pretty nice time without making up some

35
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Some rice and veggie

36
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
It was last night

37
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
How are you

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440
Did my bright spot is that we're doing this episode at all

39
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
Tired

40
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
You turned around an episode that was amazing

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
We had a weird couple of days

42
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,264
Skyrim

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
Set out to play

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,664
Schedule a little bit of a

45
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
I need a little bit of a step back and to feel so I asked you to cover Friday

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Dude

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
And we recorded it

48
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,560
Okay it was thoroughly okay was a very interesting exploration of some

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
Dies on YouTube

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
I realized it was like

51
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
You know a lot of

52
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
So the monotony going on with Alex

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
And it would be a good time to take a little bit of a break sure he's something else and I don't know if I'm really capable of finding

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
New

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Fingers anymore

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,832
Like I brought alexson project

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
The dogs of war

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
And Bill Cooper Tucson

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Text that but like

60
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
Somebody other efforts have not been great

61
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
And found something

62
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
No spoilers

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
It's already been

64
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Spoiled thinking we should just release it the way it was with

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Half hour the

66
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Recorded it

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
2 hours

68
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,432
Dead Silence

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Jordan craft the

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
The car

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,112
Get away from the wheel

72
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
We recorded it and somehow

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Delta College

74
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
At something happened

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
There's audio of us talking for the first half-hour

76
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Hitman after that point

77
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
It's just the drop

78
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
That's almost like one of those coloring books

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
You guys listen to the first half-hour of us talk again

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,527
Make your own doll

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
There's going to be 20 minutes dratch's where your there's nothing

82
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
There's no audio

83
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
Premeditated

84
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Find you

85
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
So in a. Of

86
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
Mere hours you've put two

87
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,775
Together another episode for us to release their

88
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
Only share it for the rest of your one will ever know

89
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Yeah it

90
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Don't want you to feel too bad

91
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
It's not it's not your fault

92
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,255
I think the only problem really is that puts me at like

93
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
What

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,351
One out of every five episodes I do disappears

95
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,959
That wipe off 100 episodes

96
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Yeah I am buy more used to the server troubleshooting knowing when something's wrong and I kind of

97
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
It's no big deal

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
I feel bad for the listeners in for you because

99
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
You know you did

100
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
About bring something into

101
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Do that

102
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
To the table

103
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,951
Maybe there's something later but

104
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Certainly not that episode can't redo it

105
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
Baffling enough as it is let alone trying to do it again

106
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Lost episode well

107
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,567
So Jordan today we have a interesting thing to go over that I have

108
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Scrounged up

109
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Today we're going to be

110
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Sing about

111
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
October

112
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,575
16th 2014

113
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,695
Typical price you have thought of you thought of that last night

114
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,583
Maybe this morning while I was laying in bed

115
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
Very bad blackjack

116
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
But

117
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Yeah so I decided I wanted to go back

118
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
2 time

119
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Before Alex was

120
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Quite as

121
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,087
I don't know overly amphetamine.

122
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Insert for a before the time of trump

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
I wanted to get a little bit more of a

124
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Taste of that sure

125
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,095
Scrolled around randomly and

126
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
The name and the

127
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
In the description

128
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Here we go actually I was

129
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Listen to this

130
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Hauntingly appropriate

131
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
We've done this

132
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
Too many times for you not to be a fee at Boost so my credibility as a

133
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
Either that or nothing ever ever change

134
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
And it is all the

135
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,743
Or everything is the reverse of always the same

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,607
So I am excited to get out of business on this episode before we do Jordan retake my birthday thank you

137
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
Revoke suicide up and are walking it up

Person this is a very exciting

140
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
A rare

141
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Double alias

142
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
But they're both good someone allowed

143
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
First is North Korean ballad boat Hellyeah piloted by the skipper Rodger Stone

144
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,671
And the other eye is private chef of Alex's wife's tennis partner

158
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Dreadful feel too

159
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,911
You know what I'm saying

160
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
Sonam similarities similarities

That's icua we have a

00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
Clearly illuminates the difference

164
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Does between our personalities

165
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783

00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Money off that heroin

170
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,687
Freakishly large

171
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,575
Replicas trailer

172
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Kwi

173
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
In an abbreviation

174
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
We can agree to disagree on that always

175
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Nope

176
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Articles never go

177
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Okay so Game of Thrones is GT

178
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Bye

179
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Not got

180
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
What there's a reason o is lowercase in that always simply that everyone agrees with Game of Thrones.

181
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
And maybe they should

182
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Okay

183
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Spanked on your birthday

184
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,303
. birthday spankings have I ever been birthday today I think I was birthday

185
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
They spanked one time as

186
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
As like a 11 or 12 year old

187
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
And everyone immediately went

188
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Now this was

189
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
A good idea to be really weird because like you

190
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Do you know if you didn't

191
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,687
On your 10th birthday it's not like a towel pinned up till then

192
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
Somebody it was it was very much like somebody at my birthday party had

193
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Just heard of birthday spankings and was real excited

194
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Try it out like

195
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
This will be a new

196
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Thing at everybody stopped and was just like no

197
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
What is

198
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
No I don't think

199
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
Ever

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,423
I don't think I've ever been a fun

201
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Family shot

202
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,759
But there are some people who are celebrating a birthday

203
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,599
Spanking button

204
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,439
Light up light up for the birthday

205
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
I think I might have gone down the wrong road with this setup but

206
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Earlier this week on Monday Pat

207
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Happy birthday and wanted to say happy birthday to you Patty

208
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,495
On Monday but I'm not great

209
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Also tomorrow

210
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Haha

211
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Terry MC

212
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
North Carolina

213
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,855
You having a good one out there and I hope you had a great one

214
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Hindi

215
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Happy birthday

216
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
Spanx all around spanking cuz I realized

217
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Hello weird

218
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm going to get into this house

219
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
That's a good transition

220
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,079
October 16th 2014 what do you know what was going on around that time what do you would you got together

221
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Feeling

222
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Let's see

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
2014 I would have

224
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Just woken up from a 3-year sleep

225
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,391
Over here

226
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Just welcoming awareness

227
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
It's once again tonight moved to Bloomingdale Illinois

228
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Gorgeous

229
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
One-bedroom apartment

230
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Nipple episode is shockingly mostly about residential pricing in Bloomingdale

231
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,663
All I'm saying is those are the only things I remember Brooks 2014 is a surprisingly right in your wheelhouse I may be a witch

232
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
No

233
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
October it was Ebola

234
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,135
Middle of the. We're

235
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,719
There were couple cases of Ebola here in the United States

236
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
The primary patient

237
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
The first

238
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
First patient to the Cape May to be knighted

239
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Midstates had passed away

240
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
And we are right on the cusp of

241
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
The second nurse who had treated him

242
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Has been diagnosed

243
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Now with Ebola

244
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
So we're remembering when a possible pandemic was a verdict

245
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
We have done an episode

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
2 years ago

247
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
About

248
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
The first day when

249
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
There was a case of the United States

250
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
And it's really interesting

251
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
To take a little bit of a look at

252
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Fancy

253
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Growing on a couple weeks later

254
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Abyssal I mean did he go

255
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Did he go from

256
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
That if there will be lone survivors back

257
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Back to there's no problem at all

258
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,247
It's interesting I would say is trajectory have a lot of similarities and a lot of

259
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
This particularly fascinating for me

260
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
So here we go go

261
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
Start off with him talking about some

262
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Assertive Furious

263
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Narratives

264
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Pioneer host Alex Chao

265
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
They are telling 911 dispatchers

266
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Fox television of DC's reporting

267
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Not to say Ebola

268
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Over the radio

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
Or when they're basically talking about a call that they're on

270
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,575
We have Obama saying there's nothing to fear is that it's a low probability than epidemical start in the US

271
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,719
Even as we learned that the second nurse to contract Ebola

272
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Travel all over the place on aircraft

273
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
The plane was not even cleaned

274
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
That is wipe down

275
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
They pick up the trash on the floor but not a deep clean

276
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
45 more flights after she was on

277
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Five more flights

278
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
So this story that I was opening the show is about the 911 dispatcher is not being allowed to say

279
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
DC

280
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Fox BC did run a story about it with the headline that Alex's reading but that article is just a link to the original story with

281
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Witches from the New York Post

282
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
The reasoning behind this trustworthy New York Post

283
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
This but the reasoning makes total sense

284
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,471
There's plenty of people who aren't First Responders who listen in on emergency radio channels and you can easily imagine

285
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
Alpana could break out if every called

286
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
The cavemen were someone with

287
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Worried that they had Ebola was

288
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
Is misinterpreted by someone listening in

289
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Has a definite or probable case

290
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
People would lose their mind

291
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
I know you could really

292
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Do some damage

293
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Did you know that

294
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
Words can have an effect in real life

295
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
If you actually read the New York Post article this is exactly what it's about

296
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
A source speaking to the post side quote

297
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
You can't say bomb on an airplane we can't say Ebola

298
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Back in the 80s and 90s

299
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,959
Taking universal precautions met someone had AIDS

300
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
We weren't allowed to say AIDS then either

301
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
Dr. Jay Varma the Deputy Commissioner commissioner the City Department of Health give some idea of how many opportunities there

302
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
False

303
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Text to Stark

304
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Quote

305
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
We have now had about 130

306
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
3 calls

307
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
With possibly Bulbasaur

308
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
Symptoms and all 133 were false alarms

309
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
That's

310
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Well

311
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Alarming

312
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah and I'm people listening in could have taken any one of those 133 and like tried to

313
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
Presented as like look at all these other covering up all these

314
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Use cases

315
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
To be really dangerous

316
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
You could definitely get into a fear-mongering panic when you're somebody like Alex Jones

317
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
You need to buy survive

318
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,599
Emergency response perspective I do see how it could be best practices

319
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Is 2

320
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
To use language

321
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
That wooden

322
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Necessarily

323
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
Be exploitable by

324
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,863
People who may have ill-will and are listening in on your communication right which is done for

325
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Fortunate because

326
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
It would be

327
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,567
Be nice if we were just allowed to say words and even let me let me

328
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Is that even necessarily people who ale will

329
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Like some some people could just get

330
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Confused

331
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
Just panicking already

332
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
Time for that nurse story that was

333
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
True sort of

334
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
It's true that you did

335
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Fly

336
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,743
The day before she was diagnosed with Ebola

337
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
But experts don't believe that it was as big a deal as it's not

338
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
The first reason is that at the time of her flying she wasn't

339
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
Exhibiting symptoms that would put people at high risk

340
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Like vomiting

341
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,567
Even so Thomas frieden then the director of the CDC was

342
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Clear the quote

343
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
She should not have flown on a commercial airplane

344
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
Eddie immediately put in place guidelines that anyone who'd been exposed

345
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
Does somebody with ebola but only travel by way of

346
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
Controlled movement like private flights

347
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Uncharted vehicle

348
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Wowowo immediate

349
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,279
No prior to that this was just recommended by the CDC

350
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
But after quote

351
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,887
The agency would work with state and local authorities to in

352
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Force this

353
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
I saw the Washington Post article about this and it seems to directly contradict Alex's claims about their being five more

354
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Flights

355
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Before the plane was clean

356
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
From that article quote

357
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
The plane Vinton that's the nurse traveled on arrived in Dallas at 8

358
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
16 p.m. on Monday

359
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,135
And remained overnight because it was done with flights for that day

360
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,231
And then what we found out she had a bowl that we blew that s*** to the Moon

361
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
Exploded all over the f****** place

362
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,887
After that the plane received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures

363
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Before Reserve resuming service Tuesday

364
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Frontier said in a state

365
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
I was able to find the article that Alex

366
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Misrepresenting

367
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
There was a piece of the Denver Post

368
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
For the headline quotes

369
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,223
Emails out to passengers on five Frontier flights after Ebola patient

370
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Flu

371
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:34,879
As it turns out the airline did send notification to the people who are on the same plane that the nurse had flown on

372
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
But it wasn't because they had

373
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
You cleaned it was out of an abundance

374
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Precaution

375
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
The plane had been clean

376
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,631
But later the nurse was diagnosed with ebola and by that point that anyone knew anything

377
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
The plane had already flown five additional flights

378
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,799
Informing the customers is definitely the right thing to do in terms of

379
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Making sure everyone's informed

380
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Even if you followed every preventative

381
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Appropriate

382
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Stop it still

383
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Aboveboard

384
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:04,319
To tell people they can make their own choices from a healthcare perspective

385
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Not telling people would be

386
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,743
Far greater Scandal for you later they be like

387
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,095
F*** you guys yeah it would be wrong

388
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
This article points out that after the nurse was diagnosed

389
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
The plane was going to undergo even

390
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Further cleaning

391
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,591
Quote including replacement of seat covers and carpet in the vicinity of the passenger seat

392
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
But this still doesn't

393
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Support Alex's

394
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Pick up trash

395
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
Sure I think he's just trying to scare people

396
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,367
I think I should I think we should treat all diseases like The Velveteen Rabbit

397
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
And just immediately burn everything involved

398
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Everywhere

399
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
I think I might be going a little bit

400
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
Play Pendulum the other direction

401
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Everything

402
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56,287
All stocks and bonds in the airline pandemic

403
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
We have not seen what it's like to burn everything to the ground in queso

404
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
I would love to live in a world where we still have

405
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,855
Who pandemic and then also everything is burning

406
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
That would be afraid that would probably be an issue

407
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
You're probably right

408
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,791
Silence is covering this news and I will say he has

409
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Lassie take

410
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
He is dealing with things in a really

411
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
The newsman

412
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
We are

413
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
The Ebola

414
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Vomit bag

415
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
The Obama

416
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
She's Mio Bola toilet

417
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
You know memes are very very powerful

418
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,671
And that's why we want this contest it's only running for another week

419
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
Infowars.com contest print off the Flyers hanging up shoot video of it

420
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911

421
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
I will announce the winner

422
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
#Ebola contest

423
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Hellboy

424
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
Wow

425
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Tagged

426
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,271
Bola contest contest

427
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,135
He has posters that are advertising for Infowars you record yourself

428
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Putting them up

429
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
I think this is a weird contest could you be my street

430
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Realized

431
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Is that Alex is paid by big

432
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Disease

433
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Ignore

434
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
You spread disease

435
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Man it's

436
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
It's really weird that you would think of

437
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Somebody engaging response

438
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
Jubilee with topically recovering wouldn't be like

439
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:45,344
Hey let me try and use this as a cheap stunt meme promotional opportunity

440
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,976
Possible pandemic that could murder and incapacitate millions of people

441
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
We need a contest to advertise

442
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
My s***

443
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
A good dude

444
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,960
To Alex's credit or not I'm not sure

445
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
I'll let you decide

446
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
He doesn't spend the entire show

447
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,432
He also gets around to some nonsense narratives about how Christians are under attack

448
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
We have just

449
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
Absolutely over-the-top important news on the Ebola front

450
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,624
On the economic front on the Second Amendment

451
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
On the police state front

452
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
Houston literally trying to intimidate churches

453
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
And they're not giving sermons

454
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
The criticized transsexual

455
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Behavior or homosexuality

456
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
Libertarian group semen coming out and even though they are

457
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,896
Open the other lifestyle

458
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
They are defending these preachers because

459
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,576
If you're going to have your right to live the way you want somebody else has to have their right

460
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
To live in

461
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Nnn

462
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Speak

463
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
Claiming authoritarianism

464
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Pun intended

465
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
Out of the Houston mayor and the rest of

466
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
At best

467
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
That's word Play Churches

468
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Europe

469
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
This is a model

470
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
Everything you see the political correctness out of Europe in Canada

471
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Is coming

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
They are rest

473
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Preachers that criticize homosexuality

474
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,808
So this isn't going to surprise you but Alex is lying about this story

475
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Here's what he

476
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
In 2014 Houston passed an equal rights ordinance

477
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,512
And put included protections for members of the lgbtq community

478
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Terms of housing

479
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Employment and what-have-you

480
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,472
This is on the Vanguard of the right-wing Panic about trans people in bathroom so what are the hot-button issues was that

481
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
According to an article in the Washington Post

482
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,920
People Bard access to a restroom would be able to file a discrimination

483
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Right

484
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
It's worth noting that the religious entities were also exempt

485
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Did from this rule

486
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
So they weren't even

487
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
They weren't even involved

488
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,256
A group of citizens filed a lawsuit aimed at repealing the ordinance as part of the part of that lawsuit quote

489
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,352
City attorney's issued subpoenas to five local pastors during the case

490
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Does Discovery phase

491
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,032
These pastors were alleged to have connections to the people who filed the lawsuit and we're active in the effort to repeal the ordinance

492
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
So the attorney's request

493
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,176
Beaches presentations or sermons related to Hero that's the Orton

494
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
Parker homosexuality

495
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,112
We prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you

496
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
Or in your possession

497
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
The question that was being posed by these

498
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,560
Subpoenas were whether or not these pastors were using their churches at political organizing ground

499
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
Would you put their tax-exempt status on Jeopardy since Texas

500
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,216
Exempt churches quote are not allowed to engage in partisan

501
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,824
By October 16th the day that Alex is Huron

502
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,176
Controversy have been raging about this and The subpoena was revised to just ask

503
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Score quote also

504
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Speeches are presentations related

505
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,624
To hero or the petition prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you or

506
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
In your possession

507
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
And as we know

508
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Now that we live in the future the government really crack down on that and churches were no longer allowed to act

509
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
A political position

510
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
That would just be wrong dance

511
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,008
Didn't you see so many churches across this country

512
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,616
After Trump was elected did you see them lose their 501c

513
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,480
C3 status all over the place with political positions

514
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Terrible

515
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Complex topic

516
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
Gets into a lot of those

517
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
Is use more than anything else

518
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,720
You know you could make it an argument that there was over-reaching

519
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,840
Andover broadness in terms of the subpoenas that were put out by the city attorney's

520
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
I think that is a fair position you could take

521
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,240
Reporting this as like they're suing these dirges know

522
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Know someone

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
Sued the city in Mississippi

524
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
Is doing discovery

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Anyway

526
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
You just wants to take this

527
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
I am.

528
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
He wants a boiled down into a misrepresentation this easier for his audience to understand and more importantly be mad

529
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Yeah

530
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Walking out of control

531
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
PC culture

532
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
It would be nice if

533
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Christ had lived in

534
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
Super cool cuz then maybe Christian

535
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Things wouldn't constantly feel like

536
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Playing the victim is the only way to deal with

537
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
I don't know

538
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:23,104
Cool do what Christ was just like the Buddha and he got old and everybody's like man you kicked ass

539
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Invented

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Person to say cowabunga

541
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Jordan

542
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
I got to say what is it

543
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Expect

544
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
On this episode

545
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
As I was getting a

546
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
What was a pretty big

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
Certainly has

548
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
Mirrors and

549
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
Echoes covid-19

550
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Situation

551
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
What is expected

552
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,312
A large portion of this episode would end up becoming a movie review

553
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
I

554
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Believe

555
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
I was a little bit surprised

556
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,296
Know the movie review is about

557
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
The movie Kill the Messenger

558
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
About Gary Webb

559
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay

560
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
It's very personal for Alex okay because he apparently knew Gary Webb

561
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Oh

562
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
This might be a little

563
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,448
Too personal Alex seems to be dealing with some stuff

564
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
After watching this movie

565
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,616
And you might make like a confession that I don't believe is truth but if

566
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
Cruise that Alex Jones is the worst

567
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
F******

568
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Outlaw radio killer

569
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Whistleblower guide

570
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Call Kill the Messenger last night

571
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
I expected it to be a whitewash

572
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,024
I expected it to she don't imply that he killed himself

573
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
And it was absolute truth

574
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
Because I remember Gary Webb on the show more than 10 times

575
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
I had all these incredible conversations with Gary Webb off air

576
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Do you want me to build a website

577
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Light for him

578
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
He sent me all these documents that

579
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,176
The CIA has broken in his house a bunch of try to get

580
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,600
Making babies with my wife

581
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Suicide

582
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Thousands of pages of this stuff

583
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Court records

584
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
I guess I'll put it out

585
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,288
Gary Webb

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Now I hit movie out about him

587
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
And it was so surreal to be sitting there in the movie theater

588
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
I ignored that

589
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
And knowing Is All Storage so accurate

590
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,904
I am baffled by this movie review

591
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
I think there's a small part of Alex's pissed off that he's not in the movie

592
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
It's very weird that he's like

593
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Yeah you know what

594
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
I had

595
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
That dude

596
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
Giving me all this

597
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
Secret documentation that the CIA was trying to

598
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
The kill him for Havoc

599
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
I was busy

600
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
I was making

601
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,712
Babies with my white out wasn't interested in those

602
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Thousands of

603
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
CIA cover

604
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Document

605
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,112
Blow the lid off of everything

606
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
But come on guys she's ovulating what am I going to do if I do think this isn't

607
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,840
I think it is story is not

608
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
True but

609
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,936
It's interesting the way he gets himself off the hook for having not broke

610
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Open things

611
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104
Can other stories I don't have time for this

612
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
So let me ask you a

613
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
In the beginning

614
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,760
I thought I heard him say I thought they were going to whitewash

615
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,832
And heavily implied that he did commit suicide

616
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
What you did

617
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
And then he said which suggests to me that he thinks he did

618
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,512
He didn't Alex thinks that he didn't like later on he said

619
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
A few days before he committed suicide

620
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
Alright so

621
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
That might have

622
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Just been Alex's like

623
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,592
Sort of subconscious leaking through a big

624
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,456
You know what what are the reasons I think this is all bulshit is

625
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
This

626
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,064
Oh my gosh that shows important

627
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
I felt

628
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Incredibly guilty

629
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
That I don't even know where that disc is

630
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
That CD-ROM

631
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
Open. But it was just

632
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
I don't know

633
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Process

634
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
Copart

635
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:41,664
Talk about how I had that been working I like the killing people over the stuff

636
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
And then I went to

637
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
Last night when I got home

638
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,064
I went to bed I woke up middle the night went to search

639
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Our

640
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
3 a.m.

641
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
4 a.m.

642
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
Couldn't even find one interview

643
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
I did was Gary Webb

644
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,840
Anna makes me think maybe you didn't interview

645
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,448
Hi Betty did I could see that absolutely haven't happened

646
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
That a certain point

647
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
It kind of God of Wonders like

648
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
Are you did you imagine all of this

649
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,736
It did you have a like quiet conversation with Gary Webb hammerhead

650
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,088
You know that you have the CIA to kill anybody who has all this information

651
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
And like Alex has the

652
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,952
Did CD-ROM that Gary Webb had given him

653
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,280
Wright was following him they would know who you made the handoff with Alex

654
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Absolutely

655
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,168
Alex's is going to lose it

656
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
He's got a

657
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
AOL

658
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
We don't need to worry about that

659
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
Looking dude

660
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
It doesn't even have a file cabinet

661
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,456
I was surveilling in the other night just too busy f****** his wife

662
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Trying to make babies

663
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
I'm sorry

664
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
It's not even like that disc

665
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:58,208
It's not even an AOL sleeve Ethan a Moody Blues

666
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Cover that he is just

667
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,608
Lost he's never going to find that thing floppy that's what he's got

668
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
This is weird

669
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
I don't know why I put myself even in those

670
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Shoes

671
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
Choo choos of a helicopter

672
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,152
I imagine there was only one set of foot shoes

673
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
That's what I was

674
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
Scary scary Mary Webb

675
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
I feel like

676
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Is there

677
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
Phone of authenticity and Alex's body

678
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
The 2nd

679
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,512
That the guy who wrote dark Alliance

680
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
Is giving you a CD

681
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Secret document

682
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
You drop everything

683
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
This is a priority

684
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
Do you remember when Snowden released

685
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
Chip

686
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,688
Every news organization was like okay we're going to put 15 people on this we're all going to read everything

687
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
Single one of these documents we're going to write stories about it immediately Wold wasn't like I'm making police state

688
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
2005 busy sorry

689
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Supposed

690
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,120
Have you ever tried to adopt kids in America from Brazil

691
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,216
I don't want to s*** on the idea of like prioritizing trampoline what have you

692
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
That's all good but

693
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
If you're somebody who

694
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,360
Fancy yourself an investigative journalist Mission it is

695
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
Just to get to the bottom of

696
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
The nefarious doings of the club

697
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
This Behavior

698
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,344
Strikes me as very tip of the spear was busy

699
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Swear

700
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,952
You know what I'm saying

701
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
There's a sense that I got

702
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
From listening to this that like

703
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Alex seems to think

704
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
But that movie might be about

705
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
And then watching how they demonized him and how they tried to

706
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
Kill his name before they physically killed him

707
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,848
And experiencing a lot of this myself

708
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
It was a surreal

709
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
I've never gone to see a movie

710
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Where

711
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
From what I know it was so incredibly accurate

712
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
And so incredibly sad

713
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
And then I resonated with it

714
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Because

715
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,376
They always make it about the individual if they can't disprove your facts

716
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
Demonize and destroy the individual themselves

717
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Feeling in my stomach

718
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,848
As I realized that the clocks just took until they come and shoot me in the head twice

719
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
Plant drugs on me or shoot me

720
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Point or something

721
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,040
It made me sad to watch all the cowards his editors and

722
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
IQ

723
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
You literally said that you didn't have

724
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,768
Describe I so sad for

725
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
He gave all those documents to those that there's a baby

726
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
We're not going to put those out he gave us

727
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,616
Little bit of an a******

728
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Is just out of

729
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Just do it

730
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Documentaries

731
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,064
Shadowgate

732
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,792
Think you might be faking a lot of it so he ran

733
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
This clip to me was actually one of the more interest

734
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,192
The glimpses into how Alex operates in these circumstances

735
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,288
The people that are supposed to be cleaning the aircraft

736
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Are told that they can't wear masks and gloves

737
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176
Aircraft coming in out of West Africa

738
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
In some cases with vomit in them

739
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
Because it'll quotes

740
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
According to those articles in the moment

741
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
Offer steps for avoiding public Asteria

742
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
A different contagious threat

743
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,328
About the hysteria being a bigger problem than Ebola itself

744
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Well now the New York Times is reporting on it

745
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Today

746
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
I just left the juxtaposition of those two stories is fast

747
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
In the first one Alex is claiming that vomit filled airplanes are arriving in the United States from West Africa and not being cleaned

748
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
Obviously trying to create the impression

749
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,088
Are so many more cases of Ebola in the United States that were being told

750
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:14,208
This is America that can really only lead to people freaking out and behaving irrationally

751
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,816
But the New York Times says that freaking out in hysteria is just as bad right

752
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
You both and Alex

753
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
Infowars has been saying all along the public is very is a bigger problem

754
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
What was everywhere but freak

755
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,408
How can you possibly not understand everything he does exist

756
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
The only to heighten Hysteria

757
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:42,368
Yelling about how the borders wide open and vomit planes are arriving is not only factually untrue but it's also does

758
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Going to scare people

759
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Alex understand

760
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
That and it's one of the things that he does

761
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
Is on his show that I think is incredibly abusive

762
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Exact

763
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Push and

764
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,632
Pull simultaneously the people's mine

765
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
It's. Good he's in a weird almost like

766
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Experiment

767
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
If

768
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,408
His experiment to me of like listening to his show would be somebody sitting in a chair like strap

769
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
Down in every 5 minutes just a little jolt

770
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Old is giving you the emotion

771
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Center of their brain

772
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
To sit there

773
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
For 4 hours

774
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
And feel this constant emotional pressure

775
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Yeah

776
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Now

777
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Experience I don't think

778
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Not that far off

779
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
Disconnect

780
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
From it so it doesn't affect me as much listening to it but not

781
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
The brain would be very antagonized

782
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
If you believe anything he said

783
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Since I don't

784
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm a little bit of news

785
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
You're right you got rubber on your brain now

786
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Alex is kind of right

787
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Caesarea is a very serious

788
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
Concern when it comes to Public Health matters

789
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
It's just that in this

790
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Case he's one of the most

791
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Hysterical

792
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
It's not

793
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,888
Cruel cruel to be like a nobody is serious crazy

794
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
And you're going to die like okay

795
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
Maybe not

796
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Maybe not

797
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,872
Killing you but maybe not now hold on

798
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
What's up

799
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
I thought

800
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Listening to

801
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
The original episode

802
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
About this. Of time and Ebola

803
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Situation

804
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
And listen

805
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
To the beginning of this episode

806
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
I thought do you know this is horrible this is

807
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Response

808
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
It's got a tasteless

809
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
2 habits

810
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
Cbolo meme contest

811
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
But I didn't think it was that weird

812
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,728
It's not weird enough for Alex Jones

813
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Here's where it gets weird okay

814
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
They first showed that

815
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,152
It was her fault that she shouldn't have done it

816
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,224
An NBC news that Ebola patient

817
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,088
Contacting the CDC before flight agency says

818
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
Was told she could

819
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Comply even though

820
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
She was in a bowling nurse

821
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
And even though she told him she had a fever

822
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Well she wasn't Peter Pan

823
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
And I'm sick

824
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Can I fly

825
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
You can fly

826
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
My dog has rabies

827
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,312
The mouth should I put it in the schoolyard a kitsch

828
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Yes but the dog with rabies

829
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
End of the schoolyard

830
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Kissing on the ground

831
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
I pick it up and kiss it

832
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
Yes that's a good idea

833
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
There's a cliff by my house 1000 feet

834
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,304
The Ebola patient CDC

835
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
Hahaha

836
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
I'm going to fly horses that was on the news just been around Ebola patient

837
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,080
I was reading about a patient I'm a fly of a fever

838
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
That's a great idea

839
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
They're not just turning off the default they're sending me a bowl of kids to school they're not cleaning up the apartment

840
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,136
Weird is going on and why are nurses getting it

841
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
What the family

842
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Isn't getting

843
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Either they're covering up that they have it

844
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
It's what

845
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
CIA whistleblower

846
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,704
Back in the middle of last month here mr. Steele

847
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
It was your cue that clip up later

848
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,104
He said he believed they would release a biological simulant

849
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
It wasn't a Bola

850
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
People sick or even kill

851
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
False flag

852
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,088
Possibly mr. steal our buddy

853
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,416
That's Robert David Steele

854
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
Yep that one's got the multiple time Project Camelot gas

855
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,888
The global of dead children enslaved on Mars bases

856
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
Robert David Steele

857
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
That dude's credibility is in

858
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,520
Incredibly love

859
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
You can't disprove it

860
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Pakistan you try and go after

861
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
And I can clearly see you just

862
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Taking this to a personal place

863
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
You can't prove that it's not a

864
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Bio weapon

865
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Sure not my job

866
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
Still I have been on Alex's show in September

867
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
To speculate about the possibility of a

868
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
False flag Ebola attack

869
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
But the fact that he was creating narratives about a bowl at that point

870
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
Is it really all that weird

871
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,168
The first case in West Africa from this outbreak was reported in December 23rd

872
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,240
And by March 2014 there was spreading happening

873
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
By July it'll reach the capital cities of Guinea

874
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Liberia and Sierra Leone

875
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
According to

876
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
CDC quote

877
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,016
This was the first time Ebola extended out from more isolated rural areas

878
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
And into densely populated Urban centers provide

879
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
An unprecedented opportunity for dreads

880
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
So Ebola is on the brain as far as any context

881
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
And yeah by August very bullet

882
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
Scares being reported to hospitals in the United States

883
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
According to the advisory boards timeline quote

884
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
Before the end of the month more than 60 hospitals reported some type of scare to

885
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
The CDC

886
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
But none of the tests sent to the Aging

887
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,848
Return positive

888
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
For the virus

889
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
So at this point it was

890
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
In people's minds

891
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
Right right now that's what you would be talking about if you are going to say there's a

892
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Texas

893
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:07,231
He's coming to the United States you're going to say 100% it's the flu know everybody's thinking

894
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
About ebola is worried about it.

895
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,863
Robert David Steele had every reason to shoot the shot when he did

896
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Hit that was growing in

897
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,983
Security around the outbreak and it was affecting the psyche of the American public

898
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
If a case

899
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,615
Did end up coming to the United States he would look like he was way ahead of the story and he had a narrative

900
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
In place

901
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,199
Have no case ever arrived here he could just ignore it

902
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
Or claim that the globalist

903
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,111
Decided to go a different way with their evil plans there's no downside to this kind of spitballing

904
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
Consequences

905
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
As for the story about the nurse on the

906
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,327
Playing Alex is making up that NBC News reported that she did in fact

907
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
Check in with the CDC before getting on

908
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
On the plane

909
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,471
The problem is that Alex is acting like a CDC has a staff of like

910
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
12 people and everyone knows everything

911
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Things going on

912
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
This very article that Alex is referencing a

913
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
Explains how everything a

914
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,991
At the time it was believed that this nurse had worn all the appropriate protective

915
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,087
Gear and as such she was considered a lower risk category of person

916
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Technically titled quote

917
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Uncertain risk

918
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,999
Before she flew the nurse called the CDC and talked to a staffer Who quote

919
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
Looked on the agency's website

920
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
For guidance

921
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
The spokesman Todd spokesperson said

922
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,679
The category for uncertain risk has guidance saying

923
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,519
A person could fly commercially if they did not meet the threshold of a temperature

924
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
Of 100.4

925
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,687
She had a slight fever but it was below that reading so technically she wouldn't have been barred from flying

926
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Director freedom

927
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
Know that you had contacted the CDC when he made his comment.

928
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
But you shouldn't have flown

929
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
From the NBC news article quote

930
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,207
The spokesperson says he believes frieden said that

931
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Set that

932
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Because it should have been common sense

933
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Text to Vinson

934
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
That you should not fly with a slight temperature

935
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
Even though we have a CDC guideline that says you're fine

936
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
Yeah I mean look

937
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
I don't I'm not going to defend all that is gold but the CDC is wrong

938
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Wrong not her

939
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,271
Probably got we need better guidelines guidelines

940
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Clearly

941
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,879
Side oversight sometime I can't see anything

942
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
More response

943
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
Possible if you are this person then

944
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
Literally going to

945
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,535
Direct to the CD f***

946
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Not going to the website

947
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:26,495
It also frustrates me a little bit so I went to the website

948
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
I don't like that

949
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Seems like maybe in this case

950
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
You should have brought it up

951
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
Flagpole

952
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
No fault of hers at home

953
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
I see President just being like what

954
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,367
I see bases being covered in terms of like

955
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Clearly no one was acting with

956
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
Like malicious and absolute

957
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
There wasn't even like

958
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Covert negligee

959
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
Just this is

960
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,447
How an oversight can happen

961
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
It seems like like basically I'm saying is like if he

962
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Decisions

963
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Happened

964
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
Everything happened the way it did

965
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,735
They're certainly not enough here to justify speculating this is a false

966
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,575
Flag outbreak details

967
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
Anything but a false I don't know I don't know

968
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Volkswagen

969
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Honestly it's more his

970
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Hysterical hysterical

971
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
For it to not

972
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Be a false flag

973
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,007
Because they did something surprising as

974
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Do we know

975
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
Everyday does this sound hysterical

976
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
Also does this sound

977
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
Familiar

978
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Let's continue here

979
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
911 emergency dispatchers instructed

980
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,623
Not to say Ebola over the radio

981
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,279
That's out of Fox News d.c.

982
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
How to create

983
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Code

984
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
To describe

985
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,567
Eyeball it probably is already spreading in the u.s. grade

986
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,639
Breed first and then they'll

987
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,991
Not where it all began or where it started and how it's all Obama's fault

988
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
And it's going to bring in a medical tyranny

989
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
Fortune aculation

990
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,647
Annabella Melinda Gates Foundation

991
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,487
Dedicated to population reduction in the Monsanto vaccine they produced

992
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:29,375
I'ma say that again Bill Gates Wiki boarding you about people

993
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,679
He wants to put a bolo shot in

994
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,031
You think that's going to be good for you. It's exactly the same

995
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Cheese's

996
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
Shockingly.

997
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,991
I probably felt just as real to his audience

998
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
In 2014

999
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
As it does to people listening to him now

1000
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Hip AIDS

1001
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
So

1002
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
It's it's outrageous

1003
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
It's just that circumstances were handled differently

1004
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
And of course

1005
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Ebola and

1006
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,839
Covid-19

1007
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
They transmit differently

1008
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
Require different

1009
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
Responses

1010
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
This is amazing

1011
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
It's just it's almost

1012
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Script

1013
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
It it almost felt like you

1014
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
Could just take Ebola out and put covid

1015
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
Or Coronavirus

1016
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Exactly the same

1017
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,855
It is it is kind of

1018
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
7 years ago

1019
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
It is

1020
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
I think a Lester do

1021
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
The

1022
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Level of

1023
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Power

1024
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
That Alex and his ilk

1025
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
Patent

1026
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
14 as opposed

1027
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Is 2 in

1028
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
2019

1029
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:42,335
That level of influence was Far lesser and their effect

1030
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,151
Far lesser not to look at this

1031
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
As a

1032
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,479
And it's not again there difference

1033
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Diseases

1034
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
It's not a one-to-one

1035
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Compare insurance

1036
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
But it's hard not to look at

1037
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Get the difference

1038
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
Between 2014 and

1039
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
2019

1040
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
No one

1041
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
Should be held accountable for at the very least

1042
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
You know

1043
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,119
Truly a f***** up

1044
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
I think

1045
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,167
The people need to be held accountable

1046
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,263
I think that one of the differences that you see is little people responded

1047
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,103
What kind of more appropriately

1048
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,479
At that time at least people who are actually making decisions and end

1049
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
And being a dog

1050
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Right

1051
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
Oh

1052
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
I don't care

1053
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,903
And the president wasn't repeating things Alex

1054
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
Yeah

1055
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
Yeah

1056
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Think I think

1057
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Pickles better

1058
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
One could make that argument

1059
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
I've gotta

1060
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
Yeah I think it would be a hard one to convince

1061
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
If you're somebody who's

1062
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,079
I don't know in the past and you're listening to Alexandra

1063
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,383
Some of the stuff that you saying about ebola seriously

1064
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
I would say like maybe you should hear this and be like

1065
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
I'm going to turn this

1066
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,575
Tonight to get groceries you heard about the phenomenon and government buildings suddenly

1067
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,415
The people are peeing on the walls and going the bathroom and cubby holes and

1068
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,743
In the hallways you know the bathrooms are working perfectly fine

1069
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
And smearing all over the walls

1070
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
This is what mental patients do this is what people

1071
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
You are above the law start doing

1072
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Running around going to the bathroom

1073
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
This is what happened

1074
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
This is what happened

1075
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,039
The government is so out of control and Drunk on Power that they were pooping and hold on hold on

1076
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
I just literally Road

1077
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:37,791
So I didn't know what I was talking about and it seemed really silly it so I decided to look into it and see if I can figure it out

1078
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
I figured it out

1079
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,887
So in late August 2014

1080
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
There was some stories going around

1081
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
About 8

1082
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,775
Particular a EPA office in Denver which had quote

1083
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,639
Been beset by roughly a dozen suspected incidents of a restroom shenanigans

1084
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Translate 2030

1085
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
Being according to emails

1086
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,991
Memorandums an incident reports

1087
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Restroom shenanigans

1088
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
That's fun

1089
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Apparently someone who's f****** around

1090
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:06,975
Unclogging toilets with paper and putting s*** in the hallway short

1091
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,119
This is clearly the work of an unstable individual who works at that office

1092
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
But here Alex is reported this as some kind of proof of the corrupt decadent to the government delete this so bored of me

1093
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,919
Pirates there's a new phenomenon of everyone's shiting in the hallway weirdo getting his rocks off and

1094
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Really uncomfortable way

1095
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Alright

1096
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
I love you like

1097
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
I could be able to look

1098
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,903
Back in the past and like seeing the wave at these stories get

1099
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
Twisted by Alex into being so much larger than they actually are

1100
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,607
He does in a way create more Fantastical in

1101
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Interesting stories

1102
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,471
It's obviously a fairly interesting story that someone's

1103
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
Putting s*** in the hallway at anyway

1104
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Sure

1105
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,383
Kind of interesting more fun to imagine that

1106
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
Government is run by Dean

1107
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
Freeman tire and two are so bored

1108
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Did they have to ship

1109
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
Is the hallway to get off it is kind of funny

1110
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
It is flies a lot more interesting stuff is happening

1111
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
In a world that was

1112
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,303
Wasn't so much like Alex's

1113
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631
Weird dark circus versions of government

1114
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
And then we lived in one

1115
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Is this bad

1116
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
No good so at this point

1117
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
In 2014 you really have psych

1118
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,871
Gentleman speak

1119
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,687
Creely kind of vibe

1120
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
Oh that's not good they didn't really have the lawsuit

1121
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,719
Why no protective gear for men with Dallas Ebola patient we have video This Will Roll some of it the background

1122
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,791
Video from CBS News up on infowars.com

1123
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Prisonplanet.com

1124
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,143
This lends Credence to Rob do running around the office

1125
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
Analyzing video and he's work

1126
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Home Shopping Network

1127
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
You know he's he's being Direct

1128
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
Geno's Steaks.

1129
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,271
And that he says that you know why are people not wearing protective

1130
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
With the Ebola patient

1131
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
As we have right there

1132
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,487
And I usually people just don't care they're idiots

1133
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
Or is there a third possibility would that be

1134
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,679
So there was a video of people putting all that nurse

1135
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Into a play

1136
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
They said I was making around

1137
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
And all but one of the people are wearing Hazmat

1138
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Batsuit

1139
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
It definitely looks like fodder for Alex to make it a

1140
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
Conspiracy out of a Abdu to use

1141
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,039
To justify crisis actor theories but it's not really that crazy when you get down to it or yes

1142
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
The question-and-answer

1143
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
From somebody

1144
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,207
This person in the video is not in any direct contact with the patient

1145
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,023
Who's wearing her own set of protective gear as well

1146
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,119
The chances of transmission are incredibly low based on how Ebola goes from

1147
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
From person to person

1148
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
That being said

1149
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,495
I wouldn't do this to his that's just because of me

1150
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
But it might not be that

1151
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Really f***** up or dangerous

1152
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,943
This very article that Alex is citing in order to talk about the headline includes this passage

1153
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,343
When a member of the Dallas CDC team was shown in the video and asked if it was a safe moment or not

1154
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,903
He said he didn't have a problem with what he saw

1155
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
The situation

1156
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
Apparently met CDC protocol because the people in the hazmat suits were the ones

1157
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
Assisting Vinson

1158
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
And the plain-clothes man was not

1159
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
They CDC spokeswoman said that they man maintaining

1160
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Inappropriate

1161
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
Since when the patient for the amount of time on the tarmac

1162
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,567
And it must be taken into account that Vincent was also wearing protective

1163
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Gear

1164
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,735
This is how little some idiot like Rob do needs to justify denying people's illnesses and deaths

1165
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
You just need some video of it looks

1166
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
Strange that he didn't care to look into it all

1167
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
The thing that I

1168
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,671
I still have a hard time wrapping my head around

1169
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
That we found out from all those Depp

1170
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
At this point

1171
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Point-in-time

1172
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,583
Apparently only PJ dub

1173
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,911
In the entire Infowars fair with listening that's going like

1174
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,495
Hello

1175
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Stop blokes

1176
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Exactly

1177
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
Of all people you know what that might not be true but it's the only one we know for sure

1178
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
Might have been some lower-level funk

1179
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,063
Oceanaire

1180
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
I think

1181
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,279
It's probably in those people's best interest that we not know

1182
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,167
Because for them to be able to bury the part of their lives if they work there

1183
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Might

1184
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
Good for good for them if they've sick

1185
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
And if they

1186
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
I've gone on to live a better life

1187
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Isotope

1188
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
So

1189
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Stage man

1190
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,735
The stuff's probably staged don't think it's stage but okay

1191
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,855
I don't know exactly what's going on but I'll tell you this most of this is staged

1192
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
It's scripted

1193
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,719
And they clearly want to bowl with the spread now you can fill in the blank of Y

1194
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,583
My head is spinning at this point and I'm trying to contain my aunt

1195
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
Even during the breaks I'm trying to

1196
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Container

1197
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
Because I think about how they're trying to bring down this

1198
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Kill our prosperity

1199
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Makes me angry

1200
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,199
You don't want people to be sterile

1201
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
I mean I'm furious because they're killing all of us into

1202
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,183
Destroying property clearly return to intentionally spread Ebola probably by Steve

1203
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
Call husband

1204
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,583
Area is a big problem too well let's keep it

1205
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,375
Grounded

1206
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,423
Real

1207
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,727
Bloomberg two days ago

1208
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,311
Has the government facilities that are designed for this

1209
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,175
Because they wanted to spread they want plausible deniability

1210
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,271
They probably got sleeper cells walking around spreading it

1211
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,879
I didn't think they'd use Muslim radicals to bring it in before I thought that was just some

1212
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,183
Islamophobe

1213
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
But now it's star

1214
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
Eclectic

1215
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
God only knows

1216
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,583
I think the other shoe is about to drop

1217
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
About to happen I've been saying that for much

1218
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
And now you see this bracelet

1219
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Might be a diversion

1220
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,127
4 nukes are about to shut off cool

1221
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:27,135
Not only do I believe that the government is intentionally spreading Ebola

1222
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,975
He's also

1223
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
Listen

1224
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,839
I don't know what's going to let me preface by saying I don't know what's going on

1225
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:41,727
Now let me certainly describe a false flag attack that and honestly

1226
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,799
I want to go with a 50/50 shot at the diversion and you're

1227
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,103
All going to die immediately

1228
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,151
Let me go over the top in a

1229
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,735
Comically scary scenario that I've dated for you

1230
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:57,599
As a very distinct possibility based on my gears of research about how these logos

1231
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:03,231
Also this whole islamophobic thing I was like oh no I'm not going to

1232
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
Engine islamophobia

1233
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:09,119
Video where guy was walking on the tarmac so obviously it's the Islamic people

1234
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
People's fault problem

1235
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,959
It's interesting

1236
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
So he's going down this road you know like

1237
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,823
Hysteria about Ebola

1238
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,127
The man also they're going to Nuke you

1239
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Hey man we're just in trouble

1240
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:27,039
I mean it is just we have enemies in control that there is no doubt

1241
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
We are in the most grave danger this country is faith

1242
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
In 200

1243
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
40 years

1244
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
Hardcore

1245
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
I got goosebumps on my

1246
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Face right now

1247
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,303
The camera can probably pick up

1248
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Take down to the country

1249
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,543
Infowars life.com

1250
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
I'm getting my immune system ready

1251
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Infowars life.com

1252
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
Cena is a

1253
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Good

1254
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
That's a good little

1255
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Super Transit

1256
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
That's a good little at switch

1257
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,623
He does now

1258
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,927
It kind of hurts the preceding

1259
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Passage

1260
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
Absolutely

1261
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,815
Play Emily out-of-control fear-mongering

1262
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,607
That led up to that

1263
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Kind of

1264
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,679
Weathers the relationship between the

1265
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,959
You too. Suffer

1266
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,543
Yes I guess making people really afraid of a nuke

1267
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,335
And Ebola would lead them to

1268
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
To take zinc

1269
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,503
I would say that Infowars life plug really only solves one of the two problem

1270
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Describe

1271
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:35,903
And in fact I would argue V second one kind of wipes out the games of the first

1272
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Perhaps we'll

1273
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,231
So whatever games we've lost

1274
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
Shall now be recouped

1275
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
Because Alex

1276
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
Have a ghast

1277
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Boy howdy

1278
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
This guy

1279
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,495
Mike down for that because with this guest

1280
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Says

1281
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Weather alerts

1282
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
Okay but he says

1283
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,783
No damn it if we had a complete repeat of the bro

1284
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
I was hoping

1285
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:10,207
They do mention how like he had recently reported from

1286
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,303
The demilitarized zone

1287
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
Correspondents deeper traffic for a while

1288
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Steve Zahn

1289
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,639
The talk about ebola and keep directly contradicts

1290
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,967
Something that he says in the present sure

1291
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Amazing

1292
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,063
You're also a medical doctor on top of that so you can

1293
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Kabbalah

1294
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Yes correct

1295
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
And more importantly

1296
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
I was trained

1297
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Cornell University

1298
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
Medical College

1299
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
Very confident

1300
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,655
Infectious disease

1301
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Anthony

1302
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
Fauci

1303
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
God dammit

1304
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,943
Goddamnit Dan one-year witch

1305
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
N2

1306
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
Steve pieczenik is a month

1307
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Monster

1308
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:19,327
I swear to you ever since I was at Cornell he's a loser worst

1309
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Give me

1310
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,887
Stacy's so brutal

1311
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
You know who's great Anthony fauci

1312
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
Breaks my heart

1313
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,567
It really breaks my heart

1314
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,407
And I was this is this is this mirror this act always so

1315
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,967
Funhouse mirror is on the way I

1316
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,503
Describe is so bizarre

1317
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
Yeah no I mean

1318
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Listen

1319
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,391
It's not that I believe the entire world is a

1320
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Prank on me

1321
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,767
But when Steve says stuff like that I'm just letting you know what

1322
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
This is

1323
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,863
Real

1324
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
The Ebola situation

1325
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Pretty serious

1326
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,007
And I would take that outside of it being hilarious that he likes

1327
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
Fauci now and then

1328
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
The president claims to have always hated him or whatever

1329
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,127
That's funny

1330
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,967
A lot of the stuff you saying I really don't take much issue with

1331
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,271
Can you sing this is serious

1332
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
Are we have to do what we can to make sure

1333
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,695
That do responsible steps

1334
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,231
Isn't bulshit

1335
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
But he does have a

1336
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,583
I would say possibly

1337
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
Maybe not

1338
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Good plan of

1339
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
And repeatedly recommended

1340
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Is that doctor

1341
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
Reason of the CDs

1342
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
Resigned

1343
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
Volume down

1344
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,455
Because they really have no

1345
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
And inefficient

1346
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,319
And they have no authoritative

1347
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
Bandai does it

1348
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
City-state

1349
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
Mandatory

1350
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
Executive

1351
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Privilege

1352
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
Authority

1353
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
Military power

1354
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Public Health Service

1355
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
That's a falchi

1356
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,831
If you give an executive control to use military resources to deal with you

1357
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Kids

1358
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
I love it I can't believe this

1359
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Asus

1360
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,655
This is one of those

1361
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,727
You know what's funny it's almost like

1362
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,543
It's almost like the Mandela

1363
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:42,431
It's almost like we're looking back into a past

1364
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,479
It didn't happen in the present

1365
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,759
You know what I'm saying

1366
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,319
Like this is an alternate universe where

1367
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,623
Help me put

1368
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
Some pieces together

1369
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,975
Because I always did think it was a little bit weird

1370
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,559
That is the beginning of the coronavirus situation

1371
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:04,447
Alex was painting fauci at a good guy you made some calls and looked into him

1372
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,543
Hearing Steve talk about him like this talk about fauci like this

1373
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
At this point makes me think I go alexnld Stephen school was like this is a good guy and then they got the line

1374
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,831
The right-wing media is the villain

1375
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,879
Maybe they're the biggest

1376
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,903
Things that happen

1377
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,671
That we need

1378
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Need to go back

1379
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Analyze

1380
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,767
Is the creation of the fee

1381
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
Feedback loop

1382
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Between

1383
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
The right-wing proper

1384
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Buganda creating

1385
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
Trump and then Trump

1386
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Echoing right way

1387
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
When propaganda back

1388
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,031
I don't know how you would ever know where you would look

1389
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
For that I don't know

1390
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Oh

1391
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Kill all the baby hit

1392
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:49,247
I I blame Drudge

1393
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Just fall down

1394
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
F*** that guy

1395
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
Alex really wants

1396
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
This to be fake

1397
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
False flag

1398
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
Part of the episode

1399
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,535
Really felt like Alex was essentially begging

1400
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
Steve

1401
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,607
Come on help me out man

1402
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:09,727
DACA me you believe Sandy Hook was staged more more experts have come out in a grade

1403
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,543
Boston bombing

1404
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,359
So many other events 911

1405
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
The open funding of Isis

1406
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,967
Change the name from Al-Qaeda

1407
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,759
All this is coming out

1408
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:27,391
But when you look at this Ebola situation I'm not saying it's not right

1409
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:32,255
It isn't living in the body longer before the symptoms show up 21 days

1410
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,559
Clearly

1411
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
Getting stronger

1412
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
But it

1413
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,679
Just I can't believe that this type of an aptitude

1414
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Bring in

1415
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
Ebola patient

1416
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Level 42

1417
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
Let people fly in

1418
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
From

1419
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:50,943
West Africa from ravaged areas what other countries had already banned at months ago

1420
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
I need a

1421
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,039
Wouldn't be

1422
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
This precise

1423
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,159
At doing everything they could to grease the skids for Ebola

1424
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,975
Are you getting any information

1425
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,535
On them allowing this to spread

1426
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,863
Bring in a medical charity to create a political distraction

1427
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,423
Are there any motives for this to be a false flag

1428
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,215
No not really

1429
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
Cuz number one

1430
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
Create an epidemic

1431
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
Fun dip

1432
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
A very dysfunctional

1433
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
Functional governor and

1434
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
And a bunch of

1435
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
Connecticut state troopers

1436
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
And it was easy

1437
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Create

1438
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
Kaneria was Nan

1439
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
Oh boy

1440
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,023
Interesting answer

1441
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Nope

1442
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
Although this is this should make me think here's what we

1443
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
We should do we should

1444
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
All the right-wing terrorist

1445
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
All whiter

1446
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,239
Stop

1447
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,895
I thought I thought like the one that was going around before the al-Qaeda was that what it was

1448
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,199
About it before I think I used to say

1449
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,991
I think I remember that one

1450
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,439
I'll let you do a meme contest

1451
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,767
Look dude this thing that I think is really funny Beyond just

1452
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
Stevie like fauci is a great guy he should have

1453
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,887
Control over everything

1454
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
Alex being

1455
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,983
Over-the-top give me something

1456
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Give me

1457
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Andy Ruiz

1458
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
That I mean

1459
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:24,127
Blue sky pictures

1460
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,687
Jok'air give me

1461
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,759
Possible motive no

1462
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
Just money just save money you could do

1463
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Play money

1464
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
No

1465
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,999
More Illuminating that is that it's really difficult to create a fake

1466
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
Epidemic

1467
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
People wouldn't do that a lot

1468
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,607
Why is it would be a bad idea

1469
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,191
Easy to get out of hand millions of people could die

1470
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
Impossible to control

1471
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,567
Donatos not a supervillain plan

1472
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,383
That would really work outside of the movie

1473
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,991
I think I think is really interesting is that Alex is talking

1474
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
Think about all of these things

1475
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,063
And almost identical way

1476
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,623
The medical TRNA all this stuff

1477
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
The other mention lockstep

1478
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
It all

1479
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:16,351
I know about that document everyone in the document all blockstack.

1480
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:21,215
Then it's been in there pretends to have known about all this stuff

1481
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
This wasn't part of your narratives then

1482
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Beer

1483
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
No one had shown you this

1484
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,759
Existed in 2010 I mean in the in the right-wing Spears

1485
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,599
Misrepresented

1486
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879
What it was

1487
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
In a way that was profitable

1488
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
And

1489
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,791
You just see it very clearly that he just didn't have the

1490
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
The Manor

1491
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Do that attack

1492
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
At this point

1493
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
Kind of

1494
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Kind of telling

1495
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
I just

1496
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
I'm just so

1497
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
It's so easy

1498
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,615
His job the right-wing propaganda jobs

1499
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
Soe

1500
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,407
Easy

1501
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:05,503
You do the same s*** every 5 years for 5 years and then restart

1502
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Every time

1503
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
It's the same s***

1504
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
Yes

1505
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
And God forbid

1506
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
Ebola would have

1507
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,487
Nice pridemore in the

1508
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
United States

1509
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
At this point

1510
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,583
But I could easily see Alex

1511
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,727
Score on the very similar

1512
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,543
Just don't have people cough on you or throw up

1513
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,103
The more effort the

1514
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,503
It puts into stopping at the or he'd argue that that's what they're not the reason that they released this on us

1515
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Civil liberties

1516
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
You can you can

1517
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Almost

1518
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Easily see how the Playbook

1519
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
Operate

1520
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,207
Based on the

1521
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,999
Incredible

1522
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,791
Similar parallels

1523
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
You have here

1524
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,351
Yeah it is

1525
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,631
It is really surprising

1526
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
I mean that's what I'm saying

1527
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
It's it's like

1528
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
It's the it's just

1529
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
You can see it going down the same exact train of thought

1530
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,199
No matter what time. It is B

1531
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
Because it's the thought process

1532
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:13,599
Itself that leads you to believe action towards a version is

1533
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Actually close

1534
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Yeah

1535
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,951
Yeah I'm so it's it's the

1536
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Thought process

1537
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Itself

1538
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
Not like

1539
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
The

1540
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
Circumstance

1541
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,119
Changes is the circumstances

1542
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,167
Allow it to balloon out of

1543
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
Birth control or it

1544
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Contain

1545
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,287
Deeply cynical

1546
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
Cruel

1547
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,359
The the way that Alex operate

1548
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
And in this respect

1549
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
It really is a

1550
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,455
Denial

1551
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
And

1552
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,247
Des Des

1553
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
Regard

1554
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,343
For the fact that there are people who are suffering

1555
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Dealing with this

1556
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:51,999
Disregard for the people or listening or probably scared

1557
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
I need information

1558
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,583
They need to be have conveyed

1559
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
Accurate information that allows them to make

1560
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
Appropriate decision

1561
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,263
Like the emails that were sent out to the people who were on the plane after

1562
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,079
Even though they're probably wasn't a reason to be worried

1563
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
That's appropriate

1564
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,919
Giving the people the information that they need to be able to make

1565
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,199
Appropriate decision

1566
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
These listeners

1567
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,087
Are tuning into Alex cuz they think that they're going to get some kind of insight

1568
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
That they're not going to

1569
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:23,743
To get elsewhere and he's lying to them in a way that's designed to scare them

1570
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,791
And it just too

1571
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:31,423
Get their immune system ready with the products that he sells over divorce.com

1572
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
And

1573
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:38,335
As the world economy melts down gold will go up even as other Commodities go down

1574
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,407
Because it's an ultimate store of wealth and a head

1575
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,455
Against employing economies

1576
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
And it is

1577
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:49,343
Bond markets in the stock market was down so much today

1578
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,695
I thought man I bet gold goes down but I said her maybe it'll go up

1579
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,327
Because oil was way down I thought I wondered but man when I saw gold going up

1580
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,887
That's pretty serious right there

1581
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,983
The other thing is that their economic impact

1582
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
That are happening because of the above the situation

1583
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,103
There's some like Airlines

1584
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,967
Stocks are going down yeah impact that are happening at Alex's using that

1585
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
Final gold sales

1586
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,135
Gold started 2014 at 12:05 and 77 Sunset

1587
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Peking orange

1588
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,255
30th at 1327 dollars and thirty-nine cents

1589
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
On October the

1590
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
16 today this show is recorded the price was

1591
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,399
12:30 $9

1592
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Announce

1593
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
From the day before

1594
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,799
It would close the gear at 1184 dollars and Thirty-One

1595
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,847
Nothing Alex says means

1596
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
His syndicator at this point is still a guy who owned

1597
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,455
Gold sales

1598
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
Took golden super important to his world in 2014 and it's weird

1599
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,087
How it's so much less so now

1600
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,647
So in order to talk about the bond market

1601
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
It's falling apart and how cold is

1602
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Is great

1603
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,023
Alex brings in his financial body Max Keiser

1604
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
Max Keiser

1605
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
I will say

1606
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Does not give a s***

1607
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
That sounds right

1608
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,239
She is not taking this seriously at all

1609
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
I was such a so close to Gary

1610
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Norris

1611
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
Any other crazy stuff in my life

1612
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,223
Another Rider

1613
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,271
Oliver North in Gary North

1614
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,879
And that ended I didn't break the big CIA drug-dealing stories weather

1615
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,183
Cuz I was just like yeah I already know all that

1616
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,279
Tell your book you're a hero

1617
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:38,143
Why why put out new document without a website with you Gary Webb

1618
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
Killed him

1619
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,775
Attack me for saying they killed him

1620
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
The movie basically says they killed instead

1621
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,455
Tell him I'm just I just am speechless

1622
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,319
How powerful Kill the Messenger the story about Gary Webb

1623
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,647
Pulitzer Prize all the rest of it is I mean it's simply amazing

1624
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,207
How all is so-called friends turned against him

1625
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,023
When the mainstream media said he was a fraud with no proof

1626
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,583
Have you seen Kill the Messenger yet Kaiser

1627
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
Sounds good though

1628
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,471
I just feel like I dropped the ball monumentally

1629
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:17,311
Not working with him more and help him get his material out man

1630
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,383
We're still alive

1631
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
What you pretty

1632
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:28,319
Tell people that they don't want to kill up such a beautiful beautiful

1633
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:34,719
Examples of a human species

1634
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
Come on beautiful

1635
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,631
Text guys did not give a s***

1636
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Yep nope

1637
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
I like kind of

1638
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:50,079
The fresh air like a little bit of

1639
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
Come on

1640
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,151
We're too pretty

1641
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,223
Two pretty their interview ends with

1642
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,575
Alex comes in from break and he's singing along with balls to the wall

1643
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,623
He's talking about how this is a

1644
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,927
Okinawan error

1645
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Pilot term

1646
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:12,095
Jamming the throttle about the Berlin Wall

1647
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
A protest

1648
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Song

1649
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
A little bit later

1650
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,495
Like I was like I got to make a correction

1651
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,335
That's about going balls deep

1652
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
It's actually it's really kind of funny moment

1653
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,063
You knows that it's funny

1654
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
Play along with the guys are always at dirty but he's got dirty guy

1655
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,791
Can't do it either mad scene part

1656
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:46,399
Guys are just kind of like he operates outside of

1657
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,471
That are going on coz

1658
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
GameStop

1659
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519

1661
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
That's fair

1662
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
That's the type of rich

1663
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:05,599
Nobody really do only insane people want to be billionaires I think everybody wants that point of just like

1671
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911

1672
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,215
But I don't need it I can also

1673
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,239

01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:26,079
Billionaire show on RT I don't need it by 4 either

1676
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,687
But

1677
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223

I never want to go up against Rush Limbaugh

1687
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:05,759
He's got a monopoly in cities and what station is going to want to have a show to go up against it you're on here

1688
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
Not at night

1689

01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,135
Here I am in funny enough I'm now beating Rush Limbaugh

1691
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,695
In ratings

1692
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Are you

1693
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,375
Is it some stations can't afford Russia

1694
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:25,215
And Alex's is free

1695
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Makes anti-magic

1696
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
Yeah

1697
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Just offered to sell gold

1698
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
Alex is out here like 10

1699
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,319
A ball is causing problems we need you on quick to sell gold I've been panicking people all day

1700
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,599
What is not on.

1701
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Magical

1702
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
Now is the time

1703
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,487
Iman to pitch gold

1704
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,559
If you wait until the fall we're desperately go shop

1705
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:55,167
If you wait until there is a big rush it's already up with a 20-something bucks today

1706
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,703
Pull that up for me CNBC

1707
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,775
Now is the time I believe

1708
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,079
Silver or at least get some of the book

1709
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,663
Or financial perspective documents that modest resources hat

1710
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
Men like a year later Ted would lose his license

1711
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:13,087
Cuz he's scamming seats kamegai

1712
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,415
Yeah like this is kind of the payoff

1713
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
Prestige of the the panic and

1714
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
And they fear

1715
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
That Alex has been

1716
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,607
Been building throughout the episode with his hysterical nonsense

1717
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,143
His

1718
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,727
Talking about the bond markets falling apart then

1719
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,775
With Max

1720
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,311
Kaiser is a nice Bridge

1721
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,127
Do the interview with Ted Anderson

1722
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
In order to funnel people

1723
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
To give them the solution to the problem

1724
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
We've created this problem

1725
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
That is

1726
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,575
False flag Ebola

1727
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,647
You got it

1728
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,719
Change your money somehow and the only way your assets

1729
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
Forgot to be safe

1730
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
With this guy doll

1731
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
My buddy who I've been working with for 19 years

1732
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,215
Buy some buljan you've never seen and have them put it in a lockbox you don't know who is real

1733
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,823
Yeah so I mean I look back on this

1734
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
The Scientist by gold

1735
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,711
But looking back on this episode it was shocking

1736
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,551
To me I mean the reason that I chose it honestly

1737
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
What nothing to do with it

1738
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:20,671
Yeah I didn't know that this episode was about a bowl I just saw Steve pieczenik

1739
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
You're a witch

1740
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,279
Arigato f****** 2014 FIFA

1741
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,839
Sonic boom let's do this let's see what he's bringing to the table

1742
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,703
And I started love dr. fauci is what he's bringing to the table

1743
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,287
It's so bizarre

1744
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,615
Dark Twisted

1745
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,967
Distorted version of the narratives that are being sold

1746
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
In the present about coronavirus

1747
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Being

1748
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
Reply to Ebola

1749
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
7 years prior

1750
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,159
I just with

1751
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Completely

1752
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Different

1753
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
Clothes

1754
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
Like back then

1755
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,863
They could f*** around with crisis actor stuff

1756
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:06,239
Cuz they hadn't been checked on that front yeah I know Rob do thinks that maybe these before

1757
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,359
Anthony fauci wasn't somebody if it to Trump got into a fight with

1758
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,431
Hero

1759
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,991
Steve studied under at Cornell and they

1760
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
They're tight

1761
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:22,111
I you should have control of the military apparatus to deal with Ebola

1762
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Think it's fascinating

1763
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,255
Wrongly

1764
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
Reinforce my theory

1765
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,863
But Alice is full of s***

1766
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
If not.

1767
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
Definitive proof

1768
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,263
I would I would argue that the totality of our work

1769
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
Definitive

1770
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Is might be good argument not to take

1771
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Seriously

1772
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Although

1773
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
If you need further proof

1774
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,943
Go to dr. fauci

1775
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
Poop band

1776
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Poop

1777
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,183
My Wizardry I love when you

1778
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
You bring witchcraft of the table damn

1779
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
I'm uncomfortable with her

1780
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
Kind of regular in

1781
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,095
He's really kind of frustrated

1782
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Again

1783
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
Everything is a prank on me

1784
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
Beginning to believe that

1785
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
Thoroughly

1786
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Well

1787
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Coronavirus didn't happen

1788
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,664
Gaston

1789
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:24,064
That'll be an elaborate plan if I was the only one who actually quarantine

1790
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,600
Yeah that would be in

1791
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
I don't think

1792
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
Feasible

1793
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,744
Although doubtful did read a white paper

1794
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,280
Are there were there

1795
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,816
Seen a lot of false flag

1796
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,656
Also the other thing before we get out of here that was thinking about

1797
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
That was without Alex

1798
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
Like

1799
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
Just a joke that he says I have the

1800
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
The document

1801
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
I mean like

1802
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,664
He's claiming that he has these documents from Gary Webb

1803
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
It's like

1804
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456
Do you

1805
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
Or did they ever exist

1806
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,856
Anytime buddy says he has the documents it might be just

1807
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
Some

1808
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
CD

1809
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:05,536
ROM that may or may not exist in a warehouse somewhere that has no f****** idea

1810
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,864
Be protected like a Holy Grail he would think that that would be

1811
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,496
Mysteriously organized

1812
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
Sirius Howard

1813
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,920
Proof of all the conspiracies that have ever been at least the building block

1814
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,224
That would get you to wear something

1815
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Is solidly proven

1816
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,552
I think I may be billed from

1817
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,368
And I think that would be really important for him cuz

1818
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
As far as I can tell from the

1819
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,696
The Bedrock of like

1820
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,744
So many of these conspiracies

1821
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
Primary sources that you go back to that just don't hold up

1822
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,864
So he did have

1823
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,144
These Secret

1824
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,936
Classified documents

1825
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,776
You would never let you

1826
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
Can handcuff it to your wrist

1827
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Yeah

1828
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:58,784
Absolutely

1829
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
So that we did not record

1830
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:05,440
I played this clip for you though the two guys that we were talking about

1831
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,584
Watch the 20-minute conspiracy theory video and I only played you one clip from it and it was the guy narrating it say

1832
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:15,424
About a month ago I lost all of them

1833
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
F*** off

1834
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Yeah

1835
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,288
There is a certain irony to us complaining about this

1836
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:25,408
When were only recording this episode because of a Tek Rex

1837
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,296
We didn't prove anything in that episode of Lila to observation

1838
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
Who's just asked

1839
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Some laughs with ads

1840
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
Never be had

1841
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
Publicly

1842
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,672
