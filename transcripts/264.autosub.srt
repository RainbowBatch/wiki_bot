00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
Jordan Jordan

3
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,528
Does it feel good to be back in the right side of the chair

4
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Feedback from people taking over and doing an episode

5
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
Gave me a whole new respect the hell out of

6
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,664
Being me that I didn't that's for sure

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
I did not yell at all

8
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
Not my style

9
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm realizing this now probably a

10
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
Wheatley inaccurate version

11
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
Of what Bruce Springsteen Tenth Avenue freeze-out.

12
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,584
Bring up the episode about to release it I realized

13
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
That's the reason I told about it being about a snowstorm in New York

14
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Because my buddies Missouri we are drinking one night and he told me about how he was in the snow storm

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Salvatore's

16
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Now your fingers all the time like everybody has a friend named set

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Type of cell

18
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Sitter from New Jersey

19
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
Missouri

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,152
Rihanna grapes I got her Punk bar called Eastside Tavern in Columbia Missouri

21
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Yeah but I realized

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
You told me that story is probably

23
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Accurate

24
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Not that one

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,096
Owners who signed up and are supporting the show

You are now policy

28

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,832
I'm a policy wonk relaxed destroyer of worlds

Life-after

Party

34
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
You are now a policy wonk

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm a policy wonk

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
Thank you so much that was life after party

37
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
The parties have ended

38
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
Or if it's a life full of after

39
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,752
After parties

40
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Dyslexic

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Keep someone who donated on a little bit of

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
So Frank

46
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648

Don't get mad and tell your brother someone someone sodomites

48
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,520
Thank you so much

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
These guys do do that good

50
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Click the button

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,784
And if you're thinking of you know you're like I want to support Asia

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
You should instead donate to our show don't I don't know if I want to

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
General if I want to come down

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,984
Present-day episode be going over February 11th

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
The 13th

56
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Which is Monday through Wednesday of this week

57
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,456
Right which is ultimately unsatisfying cuz your Twitter is abuzz

58
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,808
Trump is going to declare a state of emergency and all that I'm sure Alex has

59
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Tumescent if the news

60
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,976
Will cover all that stuff probably on Mondays episode

61
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,655
We got it we got it will cover the beginning of the week that was

62
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
And this week was f*****

63
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,311
World

64
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
The beginning of the week and we're going to

65
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Begin on

66
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
February alive

67
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
On this episode

68
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
The show celebrating some good news

69
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,999
I know that I made the prediction that Alex

70
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Does moving away from Trump

71
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
And I do still believe that

72
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
But I think it's it's

73
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
A slow process

74
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,519
Are you still going to validate a lot of trump stuff in order to make it look like the worldview

75
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Resent is more popular

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Yeah the victory

77
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Then he's going to talk about it

78
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Is the Trump is

79
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
52% approval rating

80
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
But

81
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
8

82
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Celebrating a victory for Trump

83
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
But it's

84
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
It's really more about the idea that

85
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
My nationalism by populism is

86
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Popular and we

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,751
We can see that by Trump's numbers I'm a driving force

88
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,591
So we're going to see some positive talk about Trump but I don't think it invalidates

89
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
The transit

90
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Now unfortunately I think that

91
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
The Trump does declare National Emergency

92
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
That will get Alex to come right back around at least for another cycle

93
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,975
So I think that'll disrupt whatever process I was seeing happening

94
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
But I don't think it's going to be enough for

95
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,887
The long run it's like a divorce

96
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Divorce happens for like a year or two while you're away

97
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Start here

98
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,015
Oversampling of Democrats and stuff like that

99
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Never was just thought it was kind of like

100
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
Goofy dumb misunderstanding of how old

101
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Statistics

102
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,767
But the way he describes it in this next clip makes me realize it is a much bigger problem

103
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
He does not understand

104
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,959
The truth is explosive the truth is powerful the truth is Unstoppable

105
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,543
When people are willing to stand up and carry it forward

106
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Gallup

107
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Rasmussen

108
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
That other polls believe the Democratic Party

109
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
Is the dominant party in the US and so far more than 30 years

110
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
More Democrats

111
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
We have Republicans

112
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
Walmart

113
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
Why would they do that

114
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,103
Confusion

115
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
Jumping off of his confession

116
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
Power Wheel power

117
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,999
That's a going on or whatever

118
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
+ 6

119
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,679
However Loretta bird has a pretty heavy

120
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
Right

121
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
It's just Alex

122
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,711
Literally saying that he thinks the pollsters think the Democrats are the party exhaust

123
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
We now have the information that we need to address this because before I was willing to like push this aside and

124
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Alex

125
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Is beyond the pale

126
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Makes me think that we made

127
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
You need to take

128
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
A little bit

129
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Conductor

130
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,751
The pole represent

131
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
And often achieve a representative sampling is incredibly difficult

132
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,687
Just because the researchers want to random sampling to take their poll

133
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
It's not good enough

134
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
Just randomly call 1000 people and see what happens

135
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,879
The characteristics of the people they pulled needs to match the demographic

136
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Information

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Of the geographic area that's being pulled

138
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,583
And because of the gearing possibility of the responded to your poll perfectly matching the areas democratic

139
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
The results often.

140
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Need to be waiting

141
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Easy example

142
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
Older people are more likely to answer their phones

143
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,615
The survey results reflect the answers of

144
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
I'm not busy

145
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Acme

146
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,831
So in order to correct for this the researchers will need to give more weight to the answers

147
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
People in the groups that are underrepresented in the set of answers

148
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Do they match the demographic

149
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
The area generally taken that information from the most read

150
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Expenses

151
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
This Probably sounds overly simplified

152
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
Like realistically the older you are particularly the more likely it is that you identify as a republic

153
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,591
An older people are over-represented in the Rob respond

154
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Data of most polls

155
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,479
The amount to which this needs to be fixed by waiting inevitably depends on the demographic

156
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Information to pull takers bring in

157
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
With the random sampling

158
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
So you'll see it right up suppose exactly the extent to which they waited

159
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Credible polling organizations

160
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:39,327
Conduct reviews on the raw data to process data and everything in between that lead from the rot

161
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
To the process

162
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Just how professional statistics

163
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Alex is just

164
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
He doesn't understand that's very very basic thing

165
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
Said he would understand if

166
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
If you didn't drop out.

167
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Junior College

168
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
At least like

169
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Send an email to Nate silver

170
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
Curious curious really important

171
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
Now the interesting thing exactly

172
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Much of this going to play out

173
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
Because there's a possibility that even as the generation

174
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
That are heavily Democrat now or less

175
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Get older

176
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Past Generations

177
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Doesn't happen

178
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
If you look at generational differences

179
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Republicans and

180
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
Good like right leaving ideas are taking

181
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
If younger

182
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Horsley

183
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,695
Cuz it's like the numbers are

184
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Razee

185
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Bad

186
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Conserve

187
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
People start to get older

188
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Or

189
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
If pulling

190
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
Places find a way to incorporate use

191
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Using cell phone

192
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Or something like that there's a really decent chance

193
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
You'll see Democrats

194
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
Maurice

195
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Democrat

196
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Morgan Moore responded

197
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Two pools and then you'll see

198
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Conservative

199
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Waiting

200
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Being done

201
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Exposed

202
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
I suppose

203
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
If I was done trying to

204
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Alex's argument

205
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Better for him

206
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
I would say that

207
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Conspiracy

208
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Trump polling

209
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Can absolutely have an influencer

210
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
It's on people's behavior

211
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,199
If you see a pole like Frances for so many people during the Trump Hillary campaign you saw those poles

212
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
And there is there was a lot more

213
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
A lot less urgency there for people who saying

214
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
Well it looks like Hillary going to win by 10 so I'm not really going to

215
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
He is engaged in

216
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
This is I would other words

217
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
If you're pulling is not

218
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
2 inaccurate

219
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
People are just going to write it off I'm media

220
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
Those poles even for

221
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Rasmussen which as of right

222
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
You still see them within this certain

223
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Margin of

224
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Error that everybody except

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
So if you want to say the poles can influence

226
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Outcome

227
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
That is an argument that

228
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Can be made

229
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
If you want to say that they over represent Democrats by 15% every

230
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
You just don't understand how

231
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Not know

232
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
So now we get to the 52

233
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
The New 52

234
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
The secret

235
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Schneider

236
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Not at all

237
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
But

238
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
Trump has 52% number

239
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
Spot all the propaganda

240
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
Trump

241
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Trump is at 52

242
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Think about that

243
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,567
Done points more for Democrats

244
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Call

245
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
I told you he's really at like 65-67

246
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Conservatively

247
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
Conservatively

248
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
That's

249
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Crazy way to look

250
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Like that

251
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Reflect any

252
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Sort of reality

253
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,679
First of all I have no idea

254
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Because it doesn't appear to exist

255
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
In their data from January 21st or 17th

256
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
21st

257
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
2019

258
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,199
Gallup survey 37% approval rating for the way Trump is handling his job of the president

259
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
Which is down from a high of 45%

260
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
For the week

261
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Right after inauguration

262
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
But also have

263
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
Exact same thing as an approval rate

264
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,791
If you look at it by party

265
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
88% approval rating among Republicans

266
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Percent approval rating

267
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,079
These numbers actually are part of setting a new record for the most polarized approval rating ever recorded

268
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Simply began in 90

269
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
M45

270
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,503
Gallup record

271
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Your president ever

272
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Beating out the previous record by 10.9% and your numbers were

273
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
The worst since WWII

274
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Do not necessarily a record button

275
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
Pretty good high water marks

276
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Is one of the only

277
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
People who at certain points in the presidents

278
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
You swinging for truck silly hated

279
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,735
Posted on February 13th

280
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
But that doesn't match Alex's 50

281
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
2% number corded this episode

282
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
Alex is making a Gallop s*** up

283
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
2% approval rating on February 11th

284
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
That number dropped to 50% on the 12th

285
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
And is held there until at

286
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Episode today

287
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
43% on February

288
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
First

289
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Most people consider this increased to be the result of the State security numbers of jump

290
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Which is pretty common phenomenon in president

291
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
2011 Obama was it 46

292
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
Preside approval on January 17th

293
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Which jumped

294
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
To 52% by the 20

295
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
When he delivered that your estate of the you

296
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Union speech

297
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Important things to consider about the polo Jordan

298
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
What

299
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,191
Rasmussen releases daily presidential approval rating

300
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Statistics

301
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Appropriate process

302
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
If you can solve their methodology call house phone

303
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
From 5 to 9

304
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
PMR weekend

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,279
Exclude the landline who works at night or who likes to party on weeknight

306
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
Their process is also an automatic robotic call

307
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:10,495
So for someone to take their pool that have to receive this call on a landline

308
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
It's amazing to me that they manage to find a sample of 500

309
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Responded

310
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
Everyday your mind go to that's what your mind goes to

311
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Do you want to roll

312
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,183
That's okay I don't have an elevator

313
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Hello

314
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,935
What's federal government

315
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,287
So heavily but I'm not saying that

316
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,383
I'm just saying that to illustrate to even this pull the Alex pouting is great

317
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Exactly the same

318
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Recent polls

319
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Evan

320
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Aldi's

321
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
Open produce

322
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
What's 38% of 4

323
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
All of it the same

324
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
538

325
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
In terms of the polling on a daily basis

326
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
But what they do is they combine a bunch of different polls

327
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
And then wait them according to the similar process

328
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
It's Donald

329
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
Random asphalt from other polls

330
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Go over how their methodology works

331
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
And then use that to eat

332
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Making a composite

333
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
And then put out the

334
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
President's approval ratings on a daily basis

335
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,231
If you look at the polling data currently available Trump is -14.8

336
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Approval rating

337
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
Which is the worst any president since Harry Truman is being at this point in their presence

338
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
With the exception of Reagan

339
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,567
Most people do that as a result of the economy being in the toilet back then and all the Goodwill he had

340
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
After John Hinckley jr.

341
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Haven't worn off

342
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
I was going to say he had a really good run after somebody tried to kill

343
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
Killed he would be remembered amazingly well.

344
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
With many circles

345
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,815
So with the 52% approval rating Rasmussen

346
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
That's a good

347
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
Happy about that

348
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
There's nothing

349
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,335
He should probably be bad The Wider picture of his numbers

350
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,967
That positive favorability numbers since February 1st 2017

351
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
When he was at 8.01 + equal

352
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,207
Never should have had a positive rate has been office for 12 days

353
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
I guess the point is this

354
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,655
Someplace even when they release date

355
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Perceived to be real

356
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
It's entirely possible that even after adjusting

357
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Stanford demographic

358
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
The Rasmussen poll showed up

359
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
2% approval rating

360
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,919
Ultimately I also could possibly an outlier in the data

361
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
That are out there

362
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
And also could be explained by some obvious real-world events

363
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,391
The State of the Union the ending of the government shutdown number

364
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Variable

365
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
But I also

366
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
When the bigger picture of everything

367
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
You have to make the most of what you have

368
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
For now

369
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
All they have is 52% of

370
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
She got to run with it cuz it makes it look like a majority of Americans

371
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Love

372
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Support for Trump

373
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Adam

374
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
FedEx

375
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
I'm just so sad

376
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
I'm just so sad for the right way

377
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,767
Candle flickers violently destroying everyone around us

378
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Trying desperately to cling to power

379
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
They're just

380
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Really

381
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
But our argument against the Green New Deal as people are going to steal ice cream

382
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
Come on Mark Dice

383
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
What are you talk

384
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
If you recall the beginning of this week representative ilhan Omar

385
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Head that I got in a bit hot water

386
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
We were going to have to talk about Alex's take on that and I really would like the

387
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Republican bulshit horrendous I can't imagine how bad this is going to be

388
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,615
About some of that my feelings about glass

389
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,175
And stuff like that my feelings about

390
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
What she probably wrong

391
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Play in terms of presentation

392
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,831
I don't think that you did anything wrong big picture I don't think

393
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
She was acting out of anti-Semitism the conversation

394
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
We had about that not being the smoothest way

395
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
To make a point or whatever

396
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
It is important to point out

397
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
People

398
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,495
In Congress or these commentators

399
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
For the most part we're acting out of

400
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
Sword is a craisin

401
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Element

402
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,783
I would I would characterize it not even I think they were doing is

403
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
They were defending a pack

404
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
And so they behaved in ways

405
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
That were disgraceful and towards

406
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Representative Omar

407
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
That's what

408
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I don't think that's enough

409
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
I think

410
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
Recognized that she represent

411
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Credible threat

412
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704

414
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080

Looking for any opportunity

416
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,272
You take her down because of the holes that you can puncture as evidence

417
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,160
That's why they're so afraid after all this Scandal of

418
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Questioning Elliott

419
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584

In El Salvador

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632

Incredibly relevant

He's being put in as a special representative for Venezuela not right before being taken

425
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320

You need to

428
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
Those are things that are important to come up and most people

429
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
Don't do it

430
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
For whatever reason weather is

431
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776

That's more important actually accidentally brought up exactly the distinction

439
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
I was hoping to make their in my introduction to

440
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
Because he lives in this next clip about what

441
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
We did and all that stuff

442
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
If you listen to this clip its 45-second

443
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,760
Long and you'll see

444
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832

Oh by the way of this Muslim woman member of Congress

448
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:37,216
40 tweeting stuff about Jews having hooked noses and

449
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,336
That is not accurate

450
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
Criticism of hurt

451
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
And that guy said

452
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
These comments are

453
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Tantamount

454
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,856

462
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
Visit Muslim in their country and sell women on slide blocks

What do you think happens when you bring in Islamic country

464
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
Baby into a backyard with 14

465
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
Pitbulls with with rabies or something

466
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,800
Compatible with the West.

Siri

468
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
If Alex believes

469
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
There is no

470
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Room for him

471
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
If he's defendant

472
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
There's no room for him to accept any Islam in the country ever

473
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,816
Compatible with the West

474
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
.

475
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,472
That's a big problem because now you have called for the elimination of a religion or

476
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,800
At least the exiling of a religion ever right

477
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:23,200
Wichita constitutional right under the Second Amendment

478
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,320
There is nothing he loves more than the Constitution

479
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,464
Exactly and that's never read it and cannot understand the f****** work

480
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Ben Franklin

481
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
The Constitution

482
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,400
Yeah I remember reading

483
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Thomas Jefferson's Koran

484
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
Just had big red x's on every page

485
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
And I know John Adams slipped in there and sign

486
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Never change

487
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
So I mean this is just

488
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,952
Wearing your shirt as usual

489
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
But then

490
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Keep the spirits good to him

491
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,352
And he starts

492
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,216
Deeply irresponsible things that are in no way based in reality

493
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
And I'm very excited

494
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
You just how wrong he is

495
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
After you

496
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Of course

497
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:32,320
Shut off Stockholm Syndrome

498
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,696
Plural women in office

499
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
And now she's talking about

500
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
All day

501
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
Believable ladies and gentlemen

502
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
It is pretty unbelievable

503
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Lee just Alex

504
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Is bigger

505
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
What have you

506
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
You can't

507
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,728
Define bigotry in a bigoted way

508
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,272
Alex

509
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,880
Dismiss it or say it's okay or anything like that

510
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
Arguing about that is going to end up being like

511
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
A waste of Opera

512
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:56,288
Here's a president

513
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
2014

514
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,832
Has more women serving in their National Assembly with 28% than the US does in Congress

515
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
With 22% even after the strides made in the last midterm elections were made

516
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Any women onesies

517
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Azerbaijan

518
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
Before making her the first woman in the world

519
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
That's right she beat Madeleine Albright by 4 years was the US

520
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Is first female secretary

521
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
But Bangladesh

522
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,272
Bangladesh is the world's most populous muslim-majority country

523
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:43,648
The prime minister's have all been women since 1996 I can't imagine why

524
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
In Egypt

525
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
You like Egypt

526
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
I heard about that

527
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
Departamentos women

528
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,896
Was the first female parliamentarian in the Arab world which he was elected office in 19th

529
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
57

530
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,600
In Indonesian

531
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,672
She served as president from 2001 to 2000

532
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
14

533
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Turkey

534
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
Steeler was the elected Prime Minister of Turkey

535
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
93

536
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
What are Pakistan

537
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Course how could anybody forget about Benazir Bhutto

538
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,008
Who was elected prime minister twice 1988 to 1990

539
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
From 1993 to 1996

540
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Buddha was a member of the Pakistan People's Party socialist Progressive Party and I December 27th 2017

541
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Assassinated by terrorists

542
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
Who shot her and then proceeded to detonate a suicide vest full of bearings

543
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Killing at least 23 people

544
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
My point here is

545
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
Need to find elected female leaders in the Arab world

546
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
In terms of that sort of thing

547
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,656
Whether it's at

548
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
Or it's just them electing women to high-level positions

549
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
Long before we ever did

550
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
We have not had a female president

551
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
Email president because his is Islam is fundamentally incompatible

552
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,928
Which is why we can only have mail present

553
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:27,072
It's proven Alex is doing here is a disgraceful disgusting display of islamophobia

554
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,936
And he's trying to erase the historical contribution many others

555
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
In order to make his point

556
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,080
He has more in common with the terrorist that killed Benazir Bhutto that he does with any of these women

557
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,176
Many of them have worked to make their countries safer places for women

558
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
And make them more Western

559
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,784
Something that takes a level of Courage Alex could only imagine

560
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,368
Also I really really hate his phrasing here

561
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
He didn't say that Omar didn't have any consequences

562
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
For what Alex

563
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
He said

564
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Nothing's been done to

565
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
That sort of language is unacceptable

566
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,960
Nothing has been done to her suggest that something needs to be done to her

567
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264
From someone else that might sound like

568
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Anderson slippers

569
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Alex Jones

570
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
That isn't

571
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Credibly violence

572
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
The idea that someone needs to

573
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Something to her

574
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Is incredibly soft

575
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
Just because I want to make this even worse for Alex maybe because

576
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
He uses language like that

577
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,184
I want to bring into this

578
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,584
After he would be presented with this list of elected women in Arab and Muslim countries

579
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,424
No Muslim country would ever elect a Christian to their government

580
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:44,128
Is over 70% Muslim a Christian woman was elected

581
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
The parliament 2005

582
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,504
Boutros boutros-ghali was Egypt's minister of State

583
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,344
App for foreign affairs from 1977 to 1991

584
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
Grant

585
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
He was a huge dick

586
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
And help sell weapons to the hutus in Rwanda

587
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
What's a Christian

588
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't like it when people bring up Boutros boutros-ghali in any kind of positive light

589
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,872
Bring up the still being okay with his daughter being a lesbian

590
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
I get you I get it up

591
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
Strictly as a counterexample

592
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
Because it's a really really bad exactly

593
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,608
You know that it is a Christian guy who was the minister of State for

594
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Foreign affairs

595
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
Good 20

596
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
5

597
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,848
Get doubles 20 years

598
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Or Christian you back

599
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
More about religion in general

600
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,672
Palestinian Christian was elected mayor of Ramallah in the West Bank in

601
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
2005

602
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:08,096
A large part of developing the concept of

603
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
Food was

604
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
ReDiscover post-colonial

605
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Unifying identity

606
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,824
Where's the Christian president of Senegal from 1960

607
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,408
Senegal is a country that is about 96% most

608
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Keith Ellison was the first Muslim Alexa

609
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Did the US Congress

610
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
2007

611
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
The point here is that by many

612
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Many metric

613
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
Much of the Islamic world is far more Progressive

614
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
We are

615
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,048
There are 17 countries that require their head of state be Muslim

616
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,120
But many of them other elected post

617
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
I don't really like the idea of telling countries how they have to run their

618
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
Also once we have a president who's anything

619
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
Further away from Christian

620
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
Wishi-washi deist leading we can probably talk more about how open and pluralistic we are right

621
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,880
My point is that if you get into the reality of stuff none of it matches

622
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,488
The islamophobic version of history and these countries

623
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Alex wants to perpetuate

624
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
Free religious takeover religious back by the United States

625
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Didn't I

626
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
I don't know

627
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
America is fundamentally incompatible with the world

628
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,576
Like that seems more likely to me that

629
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Although you could possibly love me

630
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Democracy more

631
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,816
Muslim woman who is f******

632
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
God dammit

633
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
So many of the women that I was able to find your politician

634
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
Islamic and Arab world

635
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Like

636
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Majority Muslim country

637
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Many of them had

638
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Incredibly Progressive

639
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Forward

640
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
Looking policies

641
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
And

642
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
Used the idea of westernization

643
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
Conversation

644
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
That they were seeking

645
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Radically

646
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,728
Were the sort of things that Alex should be in favor of

647
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,080
Because he's into this idea that Islam is in

648
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,616
Compatible with

649
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Good

650
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,200
And that Muslims are essentially barbaric

651
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Horrible

652
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Folk you can't

653
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
The forest for

654
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,952
Complaints about representative Omar

655
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
And

656
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,632
I haven't really talked too much about Alex's response to the State of the Union Address cuz I think it's kind of boring

657
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
You can kind of see

658
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
See what he most of his complaints are in this clip

659
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
What a monsterous pig

660
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,784
Great sir

661
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,672
Capturing non-muslim areas

662
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Mom has a business

663
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
Sorbonne our brain

664
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
Detrimental

665
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:37,248
Today

666
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Nice

667
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
That pivot

668
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,240
He committed crimes and Attorneys General

669
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,480
All right New York

670
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,064
State attorney-general picture Trump is broke by the end of the

671
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
A plot and that the Russia investigation

672
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Was a cover for

673
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Is it nonsense

674
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm tracking down threads that were related to this

675
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
Investigation of the Russian interference

676
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
In the process you stumble across things are like

677
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
That's super illegal it's outside my scope

678
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
Take it state court or whatever

679
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,640
That is how things go

680
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
That's not that's not a

681
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Facade

682
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,296
Investigation a really important thing that people should

683
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
You should be talking more about is

684
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
They're all like All Millers going outside of his

685
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Hold on

686
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
If you're investigating a crime

687
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
And you come across

688
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,352
You come across a lot of crimes

689
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
Maybe that's suggestive

690
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,264
The crime is probably there too or even related in some way but discreet

691
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
You know that's okay

692
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
Bank investigating a bank robbery you find an unrelated murder

693
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
Set the person committed maybe in the lead-up to

694
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,536
You might take it to a homicide detective

695
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
You're right about the cover-up

696
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Cover up

697
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
Omar and

698
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Cortez

699
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
Knox

700
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
State of the Union

701
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
To be released

702
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
Port

703
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
I have therefore they were against Trump

704
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,280
That's a different different remember different

705
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
Okay

706
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
So Alex

707
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
We're DatPiff

708
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
That was that was not good

709
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,712
What shook me even more to Mike or was it any ghost

710
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Commercial break

711
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
Eddie comes back from

712
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
And he does this

713
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
He starts doing another app

714
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,256
On the show but then he realizes that he's not doing a good enough job

715
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,840
Do a second take

716
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,192
But it's all because he saved

717
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
WhatsApp

718
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616

He shut out the brain Force plus years ago

00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,216
Dakota commercial

752
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,592
Like really suck it up for a good minute and a half

753
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,151
Start over

754
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
How many does another 2 minutes

755
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:05,183
Just on that ass commercial but on his

756
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
This is too much

757
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
This is real bad

758
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,863
It is especially after be like 10 minutes of

759
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
Goddamn these Muslims

760
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
Wait it's a very strange

761
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
It's hard to deal with listening for sure

762
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
For sure

763
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
And will I keep thinking is like

764
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
If you're going to be

765
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Flaming

766
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Awful

767
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Inaccurate

768
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,583
Information right

769
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
Right after all of that big guy is

770
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Two tanks

771
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,319
In Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates has ever done two points Tucker born

772
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
But here in America we have the freedom

773
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
To do it over again

774
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,255
Yeah

775
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
Husband talking about how he's mad

776
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
I understand

777
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
I empathize

778
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
You want to

779
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,247
We're probably going to take him for a little bit of

780
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,319
So in the past month Alex has been saying

781
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
You sent out letters

782
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
People I need started

783
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
People already

784
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Absolutely

785
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Insane got a bunch

786
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,511
This

787
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,583
How dare you actually let people here

788
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
We're just going to shut him down

789
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
Is YouTube videos using

790
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,967
Stop the white supremacy

791
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,319
That's a slam dunk case

792
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,647
If cost at $90 and she'll win

793
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,327
I've got that out there that are slammed Dodge

794
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167

Sharks in the Letters Out to just to let him know today

798
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Okay

799
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
Blustery bulshit

800
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,415
I guess for his journal

801
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
Or something like that

802
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,375
I really need to get these letters then that were threatened to sue people who are stars of white supremacy

803
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,519
Letters but they eat another letter and they would put it in and post

804
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,359
Also is anybody get sued for calling out

805
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:09,247
I got the plan

806
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Please call

807
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,671
Slam dunk case

808
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,791
For Alex at least keep saying slam-dunk I'm like I wish

809
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
If it's Alex Alex

810
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
If you do list

811
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
To wash out

812
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
I don't know

813
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Either way

814
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,215
Vanessa question a lot lately and I don't even answer

815
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
But

816
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,591
If you want to let people know that you listen to our show but you don't want to say our name

817
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
The next time you talk about having slam dunk

818
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Cases

819
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,343
People should call you direct shipment of a court because you got a slam dunk

820
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,743
You say that

821
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:58,399
I really like that but could you do that one more time

822
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,263
Open account

823
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,663
Operation by me talking more about Rex Chapman from the top

824
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,295
RX7

825
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Good

826
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Good to active

827
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
Appreciate that in somebody

828
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
At post-career

829
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
And faculty at 6 don't

830
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:34,751
Back in the 90s Chapman highlight-reel idea

831
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:39,103
George

832
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,735
Dowdy Brown and absolutely

833
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,063
Rex Chapman

834
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Loki

835
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,903
Sick dunker Vince Carter

836
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
There's a little bit later

837
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,447
Really good

838
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:09,311
Very good it is not the same thing in the dunk contest

839
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
He got robbed

840
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Not making the finals

841
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,831
What is important is the Alex

842
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
It's going to say something

843
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
I'm being generous

844
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
Do you said something

845
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
About

846
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
I don't know how to tell you

847
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,607
You this ahead of time really except to say that what I think he's saying

848
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,167
Is he likes the world that unions have

849
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Created

850
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Right

851
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Uses to give

852
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,519
Any respect

853
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:43,103
To Union for having created those sorts of working condition

854
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,943
Fahrenheit

855
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Express

856
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
I'll see if you agree

857
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,159
For an America bitching about how bad it is

858
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
Watch outside the US

859
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Option goes

860
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
He one of the few places where

861
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
You didn't really get all the power than using everybody

862
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
The establishment

863
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
So I don't think that

864
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
I don't think anybody really itchy

865
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,159
Real progress through heaven like let's say

866
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
A duel

867
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
With a railroad Tycoon

868
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,863
I think he's metaphorically talkin about the hard-fought battles

869
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
The 5-day work week

870
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,727
Well let's not let's not forget

871
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,775
Though that those were actually

872
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:50,175
Very real battles that a lot of people

873
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
I mean

874
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,095
Dear we've had our problems

875
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,399
Middle picture correct

876
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
Details Rock

877
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:16,031
Miss sandwich

878
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
Yeah we are better because of these

879
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,479
Struggles against

880
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Bright forces

881
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
Yes absolutely that's true

882
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,927
But you hate the people who buy filling is Apple

883
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
The pie crust

884
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
The Giants

885
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Yeah

886
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Just weird to hear stuff

887
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,119
Alex

888
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
I mean

889
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
He just doesn't know what he's talking about

890
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
I love the 40 Hour Work Week

891
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
That's great

892
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,823
I love having a full weekend off

893
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
That's awesome

894
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:57,247
I love being paid a livable wage and instead of my children not being at work

895
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
I love not being paid

896
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
It can only be used at the railroad magnates own store that are actually undervalued and he's

897
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,143
I think he has a real Twisted about what

898
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
And how things became too

899
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,311
And a half

900
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Information

901
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:31,807
That my my family uses to get around

902
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
Hating

903
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,671
Important then

904
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,583
Oh my God you do not understand

905
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,375
A generous take ya

906
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
You wouldn't even probably be willing to

907
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,335
Gunslinger

908
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,967
Earlier I believe that Alex is drifting away

909
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,855
The perception that trumps victories are his groups Victor

910
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,415
I think the Dynamics

911
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
I think that'll change

912
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255
Next episode

913
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
Course

914
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,351
But for now as we're looking for this on the 11th

915
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
One of the reasons that I I believe that is the

916
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
Is coupon a thousand touch

917
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
What is Trump do

918
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
2000 Koontz

919
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
Why won't he appoint special counsel

920
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
Can I connect to Facebook

921
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,607
Get the message

922
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,447
He's watching Fox News at night and they won't talk about it

923
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,775
So he believes that Trump is in so much Danger from this

924
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
He's been

925
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
From the wilderness

926
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
What have you

927
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
I love him compared to Hillary Clinton and Michael Moore

928
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,391
Which is basically I'm saying I love Trump compared to people I think are the devil

929
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
People I think smell like

930
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
Sulphur

931
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,535
So that doesn't mean

932
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,679
Watertown

933
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
Sudo globalist

934
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
Fox

935
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
They won't tell him the truth

936
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Growing frustration

937
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,503
Yeah he might as well say I I mean

938
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,575
Look I love Ted compared to Hillary Clinton

939
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,159
And of course your

940
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,719
This whole like Trump possibly

941
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,255
National Emergency

942
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Pining for and all that stuff

943
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
Our recording time we have no idea

944
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
All we've heard is all the talking

945
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,663
If he does that I think it'll throw a wrench into the gears and type in terms of Alex

946
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,735
No matter what

947
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,039
I think that there is a tie

948
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Turning away from Trump

949
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,695
The appearance that trumps victories are his victories and all that stuff

950
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,279
I don't foresee situation when Alex ever turn

951
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Entirely on Trump

952
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,351
Until Trump does something

953
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Along the lines of

954
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,471
Actually recognizing the white supremacy problem anime

955
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,775
I don't think he's ever going to do that

956
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,847
But I would be the point

957
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
Yeah everything else

958
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,199
He's cared so deeply about

959
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
He's turned his back

960
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:43,295
Things like a Rex 84

961
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,087
Things like

962
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Posse Comitatus

963
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,671
Eccetera conditional

964
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:54,047
Because drop is doing them in some sort of a white nationalist

965
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,607
Hey minutes next Cliff we have another example of

966
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,655
This one was really f****** hard to hear

967
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,495
This isn't Alex turning his back on another one of his really big

968
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Deeply-held position

969
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
In order to support

970
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,127
What he wants Trump to do

971
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
I don't know exactly how it is.

972
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:16,831
Is there a way that Trump could possibly use the continuity of government

973
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,415
Following the Fallen for the

974
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:27,327
I mean it's getting bad in this week

975
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,983
The cops wouldn't

976
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,543
Accomplish

977
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
Global control

978
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,767
Awake

979
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,095
Yes we are going towards

980
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:08,031
Martial law

981
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,871
War

982
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,687
Where next

983
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,343
Convoluted loaded nonsense

984
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,927
But I would really love to see martial law

985
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
I'd love to see Trump.

986
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,375
Continuity-of-government things that I've been screaming about for years being super terrible at

987
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Use those

988
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:40,287
Just so sad all these Domino's that keeps falling of his like his life's work is entire career

989
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
Being thrown away

990
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,967
Is wild it really gives you a cautionary tale about like

991
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,783
What it's like to not have

992
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
Unconditional

993
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
That principals

994
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
Matter

995
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
Because what

996
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
As intrinsic

997
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
And unconditional

998
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Priority

999
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
For you

1000
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
And then when

1001
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,727
Just waffle on those priorities

1002
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
It really calls into question

1003
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,055
Senor believability about it

1004
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
F****** stupid

1005
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
Stupid

1006
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
Double edged sword

1007
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:25,343
Like what it seems like now all he really cares about is his side winning

1008
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,415
And it seems to be true with all of the right-wing

1009
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Like

1010
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
I would say

1011
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:34,303
Many of them know how shity it is in Congress

1012
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,863
So many of them know how shity of president

1013
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,751
Trumpets and once he's gone they will all pretend that it never happened and that they were

1014
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:49,151
They were all resisting from the inside I will give you a million dollars inside

1015
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:55,551
Probably accurate that says in 2 years they're all like we were all secretly resistance

1016
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,135
I believe that just go back to everything

1017
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,999
It's fine I don't know use the memory of this. Of time

1018
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Kajol

1019
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,095
The point is

1020
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
Are you

1021
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:15,775
I'm interested to know if this is how it is always been or if there was a

1022
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:20,639
Turned around the propaganda that was built up when

1023
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,551
There is no government like it whenever

1024
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:32,159
What's his f*** McConnell said I'd make sure you're a one-term president

1025
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
It stopped being about

1026
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,487
Governing at all

1027
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Yeah I think

1028
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,375
Keith has always been there

1029
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,959
Loyalty to the party

1030
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Or whatever

1031
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,543
But to the extent

1032
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
I don't know who I'm bananas

1033
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
From

1034
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,039
I have been able to do I think this is

1035
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
Very different

1036
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
Another.

1037
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
I'm not even talking about Obama because it'd be too easy to point out how I obviously stupid this is

1038
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
If you just talk, declared a National Emergency to build a wall

1039
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,567
Rubble as white people just started lighting themselves on fire in the

1040
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,895
Majesty f******

1041
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
H.w. bush

1042
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
Emergency

1043
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
Everyone

1044
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Lazy

1045
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,927
Problem

1046
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
Talk about

1047
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Thoroughly

1048
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:47,167
If Trump does declare a National Emergency in order to build this wall and stuff like that

1049
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
Beer that you have to stop immigrant

1050
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,311
The emergencies immigrants state of emergency

1051
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,919
Point of what Noah's allowed

1052
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Right is that

1053
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Is that it

1054
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:05,855
What do you think Stephen Miller f****** idea nobody else comes

1055
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:10,207
Ever again I understand

1056
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:15,839
I'm not lightly rhetorically

1057
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
At what point would you ever

1058
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Resend that state of

1059
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,007
You can always use it as a

1060
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Yonder

1061
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
What level of immigration

1062
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
Because it's never going to be

1063
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:32,991
You're never going to get to a point where there's nobody coming

1064
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,807
I didn't tell them

1065
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
Adidas

1066
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,463
That is the end of the even idea of America

1067
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
I agree

1068
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
Spiritually

1069
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,607
The point

1070
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
The logistics of it

1071
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
AR

1072
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Innocent

1073
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Create

1074
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Perpetual

1075
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,287
State where

1076
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
Like you are in this emergency

1077
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,407
I don't believe that states of emergency work the way that Alex

1078
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,711
Like I don't believe that if you create

1079
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,783
State of emergency in order to build the wall all the sudden

1080
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
You're a Duke

1081
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,647
Or whatever you call Larry Nichols

1082
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
You are

1083
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
He run forever

1084
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
I don't believe that's necessary

1085
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
But I do believe that there are certain things

1086
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
Can do to override

1087
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,863
Powers

1088
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,703
If it's such a vague

1089
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
Conceived

1090
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
State of

1091
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,335
I have to like I want to build this wall to keep people out

1092
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
It's not going to work and I'll get a

1093
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
People out

1094
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
So

1095
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,735
The conditions that require you to Build That Wall

1096
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,783
Are never going to necessarily

1097
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
11

1098
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
Right you haven't you have

1099
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,439
An untenable situation

1100
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,095
I mean it does introduce the idea of

1101
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,447
It's just a big flashing neon sign this is fascism

1102
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
It's amazing it just says fascism

1103
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
Well here's the reason why you should also be more

1104
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
Alex

1105
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,247
There's a lot of stuff

1106
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,599
I think that he crosses

1107
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Align

1108
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
In this episode

1109
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
We talk about lines across is quite a bit

1110
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,767
I think it's important as you listen to this next clip

1111
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,863
Remember that earlier in this episode on February 11th

1112
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,887
He's talking about

1113
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,191
Resent

1114
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,519
According to him

1115
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:37,663
Being over religion is incompatible with America

1116
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
In all that National Emergency

1117
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,271
The erratic

1118
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
Rank islamophobia

1119
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,183
That seems to be one of his picadillos on this episode

1120
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,535
I want you to remember that because that was the same episode

1121
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,607
It was intense and awful and Target

1122
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,143
It was a very targeted

1123
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
And then he said stuff like this

1124
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
Towards the later part

1125
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
If stuff goes into a Civil War photos

1126
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
You don't go down and damaged trade

1127
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:13,759
Okay

1128
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:19,391
You don't even go out the police you know who the enemy is

1129
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
Absolutely critical

1130
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,887
I want to warm as hell

1131
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:33,215
Another

1132
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,775
They're going to get one

1133
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
Don't shoot

1134
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
Child

1135
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Just understand it's on

1136
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,839
Going to wait this out in Kauai

1137
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
People in those areas that have already made Santa Claus

1138
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,151
Everything is going to go down because of the global it's me

1139
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
Here

1140
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
Screw this country screw our children over all this crap

1141
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
Blowback

1142
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,695
What do you think's going to happen my friend I appreciate your call

1143
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
That is so f***** up

1144
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791
That I know that he's

1145
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,351
Couching is language so much in the

1146
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,399
Starters but we're already planning

1147
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Kill all of you

1148
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,567
That's crazy ideas

1149
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
Kill

1150
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
That's so

1151
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,175
Locked up

1152
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
Which part

1153
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,527
Yeah I like

1154
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
Order to kill globalist

1155
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:04,607
Is idea

1156
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
You know

1157
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Kill the globalists

1158
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
And of their operatives

1159
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,031
Whoever their operatives are off

1160
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,871
Because earlier in the episode he even said it's like

1161
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
People

1162
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
It was a very

1163
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
Close to like trans people are globalist operative

1164
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,623
Notnot 0121

1165
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,207
Definition

1166
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:34,559
He said earlier in the show

1167
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,679
Kill the globalist and their menu

1168
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,543
If their minions are the people who are the people you demonize

1169
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Then

1170
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,199
This is when she gets back to go kill those people that are on board with the infowar

1171
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,759
And that is not acceptable on anyway

1172
01:04:54,015 --> 01:05:00,159
Even if you're saying it with his conditional if she pops off with him that is not okay

1173
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:06,303
Cuz if I've heard him call for murdering

1174
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
People all the time

1175
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:15,519
I think the thing that blew my mind is that he was talking directly to a person

1176
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,383
I just want to talk about

1177
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Stuff

1178
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
And he's like

1179
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,575
All I'm saying is you should probably be ready to kill

1180
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,159
Womack

1181
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
Cool music

1182
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:42,399
I returned a lot of things about my life if this is the guy omelet

1183
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
Your car and Ice down the road you get like really excited

1184
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,151
Like there's no way to describe that caller ID

1185
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Directions

1186
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,759
So now when you hear stuff like that it's really

1187
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
Cost because on one hand

1188
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
It's not illegal I guess

1189
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,719
Because what you're saying is

1190
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,511
We're going to f****** kill you and your people

1191
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Or whatever

1192
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,375
So there is still like I'm not encouraging violence or whatever

1193
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
But

1194
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
It does introduce a really interest

1195
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,239
Question Alex never answered

1196
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
And that is when is Bataan

1197
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
Yeah what is the point at which

1198
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,407
It is now necessary to kill

1199
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,223
Unfortunately Alex gets another color

1200
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
Oh no

1201
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,039
This caller

1202
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:37,439
He said some really creepy about being inside globalist and then he asked

1203
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
Alex

1204
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
The time is

1205
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,607
Which is exactly the issue that is so vague in the way Alex percent

1206
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
This is Mike.

1207
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
Listen to what his f****** answer is

1208
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,335
I have stood next to Nathan Wolfe came up

1209
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,735
Is it dark outside

1210
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,159
That's exactly what these bastards

1211
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,719
I can't wait to

1212
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,023
Deliver them to the bottom of the Davy Jones * 10

1213
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
We watching

1214
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
I don't know what to do

1215
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,895
Former military police officer

1216
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:35,039
Well I

1217
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879
Goes off

1218
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:46,303
What's the Catalyst going to be

1219
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
But

1220
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,983
Bulimic

1221
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
We should hold back

1222
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,479
When you have a situation where you're saying that there is a

1223
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:09,343
Conditional point at which in order to save America we will need to kill our enemies

1224
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,207
If someone calls and talking about the idea that I'm inside people's houses

1225
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,767
I know I don't even understand

1226
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:22,911
Eyewitness

1227
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
And your responses

1228
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,495
I think we'll know it when we see it

1229
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151
You are now giving them permission to to find the point when they know it

1230
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,831
You'll know when it's time

1231
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,135
If you feel like it's time go ahead and kill that global

1232
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,439
22

1233
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
Very unstable

1234
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,559
Subway the longer call I think he's

1235
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
He's very creepy

1236
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,143
I have some rest

1237
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:00,543
But he's far from the most unhinged

1238
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
I think that's kind of

1239
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,175
Bigger problem I would say

1240
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
His seeming like

1241
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,551
Like not to armchair psychologist

1242
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Any of this

1243
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
That guy sounded like he was looking for permission to kill

1244
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Yeah

1245
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:20,255
So

1246
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,327
Permit 280

1247
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,375
I mean that that's what I like

1248
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,471
Now it would be one thing if Alex was literally saying

1249
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
Or whatever

1250
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,567
That would be cut and dry fat is

1251
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Something they

1252
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,151
You that's cry

1253
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,247
This is the most cowardly way to do the exact

1254
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,903
Message get out yeah but beyond the technically on the right side of the law

1255
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,975
You're telling people there is a time

1256
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
When you see it

1257
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
It's just sort of being like I want this to happen

1258
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
But I refused cake

1259
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Responsibility

1260
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
A saying that I wanted to

1261
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:02,239
I don't know I don't I don't think it's illegal but I'm

1262
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,543
Right

1263
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
Pretzel

1264
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:11,199
F***** up yeah that's really f***** up illegal

1265
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
Somebody go see a therapist

1266
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:23,487
Bad place right now

1267
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,047
Gross

1268
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
Rhetorical question

1269
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,911
I would say the question of when

1270
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,495
Is a revolution necessary

1271
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:39,871
Lego

1272
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,175
United States Revolution

1273
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
What was that

1274
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:48,831
We got a couple sent text Auntie killed

1275
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,159
Nevermind

1276
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:56,767
But you look at you look at the situation that we're in now

1277
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,815
I don't know what the point is

1278
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,143
I suppose it's whenever democracy completely breaks down

1279
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,215
Right I don't know I don't have a definition

1280
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
Myself

1281
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Larger cam

1282
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,663
I don't know

1283
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,967
It is not a question to

1284
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
Just given like a

1285
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Hey you'll know when

1286
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,415
Because especially with

1287
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Qanon

1288
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
Internet world

1289
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,303
Evolve to the point it is now

1290
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:36,959
A lot of ideas of what would be a triggering event of something

1291
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
You don't know who you're talkin

1292
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,823
Person has some sort of a belief

1293
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,383
The Trump is going to do XYZ is going to be

1294
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,319
Some tweet of his as to be like right

1295
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
You might end up

1296
01:11:54,879 --> 01:12:01,023
Show me people show up so many places with guns and Fire

1297
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,815
Tremendously dangerous

1298
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
That's the most generous thing I can

1299
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
You can say about that

1300
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
It's so irresponsible

1301
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
It doesn't

1302
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,983
Help Alex at all

1303
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
I don't help his bottom line

1304
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,823
His audience already

1305
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
This is very stupid

1306
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Andrea Lee

1307
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,711
When you being sued about Sandy Hook stuff in like

1308
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
Causing

1309
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
People so much pain

1310
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
At the families of the victims

1311
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,087
Stop

1312
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
I can't imagine being

1313
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Make a person who

1314
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Food court

1315
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
The possibility

1316
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,487
Of recreating that scenario

1317
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,535
The inability to learn

1318
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
From past mistakes

1319
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,887
Like he's probably out

1320
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,471
That is true

1321
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
Just

1322
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,287
I don't know your Reptilian Brain

1323
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
Would kick in where it's like

1324
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
That dog bit me now I'm careful about dogs never

1325
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Selfie

1326
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,623
Don't do the same thing

1327
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Used to do it

1328
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,375
We're done with the 11

1329
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,679
Episode

1330
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,703
Exhaust

1331
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,775
I was

1332
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
F***

1333
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,103
I don't want to just do an episode about

1334
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:25,759
Friday show that would be crazy now that was heir to the listeners to the 12th

1335
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,623
Thank you very much

1336
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,951
13 interesting weird stuff

1337
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Inside it it's not a great show

1338
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
McGinnis shows up

1339
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,703
At the end of the episode along with this guy Ali Alexander

1340
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:51,103
And like I couldn't avoid

1341
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,503
Does a character he leaves and comes back

1342
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
His brother-in-law

1343
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
It's

1344
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Hilarious

1345
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:07,999
Great the desperate attempt to get people to share the video and get free Buzz Marketing ride

1346
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,047
It's also just bad as comedy there's no

1347
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Commitment

1348
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
There's no why there was no evolution

1349
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Hacking

1350
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,495
And also the right is really great

1351
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,847
I don't know if you know this but the right is really taking over call Joseph Watson

1352
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
They're really getting

1353
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Thrilled to see what they've got

1354
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
I love

1355
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
Nick DiPaolo

1356
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,391
Whatever

1357
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,463
Gavin's on basically because he's suing the splc

1358
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:42,559
That's not going to go well

1359
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
That's not news

1360
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,895
Whatever

1361
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,943
Thank you

1362
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,991
Pieces of information

1363
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
This episode

1364
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,087
And the first

1365
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
Is Ally

1366
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,415
Narrative lie

1367
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,231
But he's telling about a recent murder in New York

1368
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,023
And how it relates to abortion

1369
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
Fishman reportedly

1370
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
This woman

1371
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,727
More than their stomachs

1372
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,063
Partial birth abortion

1373
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
I guess YouTube

1374
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
The police say sorry

1375
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:49,119
Doesn't matter that the baby was

1376
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
Nope

1377
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,519
It probably goes that thing but I was kind of making

1378
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Shut up here

1379
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
Arabic story

1380
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,615
Because there's a conversation

1381
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Abortion

1382
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
New York has become sort of

1383
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
Focal point of it

1384
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,623
I meant unfortunately also this murder happened around

1385
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,671
It's creating

1386
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,743
A very convoluted conversation in the right wing

1387
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,791
I think we need to disentangle Summer

1388
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,215
Charged with homicide

1389
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
You kill an unborn child

1390
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
That is true

1391
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,567
It likely doesn't really have any

1392
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
Much to do with this

1393
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
Particular murder case

1394
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:37,503
Some of the language that was taken out of the legal definition of homicide included

1395
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,111
Conduct which causes the death of a person or unborn child

1396
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
With witches

1397
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,415
Female has been pregnant for more than

1398
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,439
24 weeks

1399
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
Under circumstances concert

1400
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Attitude inverter

1401
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
The victim of this murder Jennifer Irigoyen

1402
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
Was 5 months pregnant

1403
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,167
So it's unlikely that you was even past the point of

1404
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,983
It's far more likely that this

1405
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
What the situation was involved in her murder is

1406
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,871
The prosecutors had an open and shut

1407
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,151
The first-degree murder

1408
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:09,503
And the prosecutor probably didn't want to tack on more charges that may or may not stick

1409
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,295
Woody's going away for life

1410
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
Kind of understand

1411
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
Then why

1412
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:14,879
Messed up in

1413
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
This gray area

1414
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
Buckstop right

1415
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
Corrections

1416
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
I need to make

1417
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
To Alex's store

1418
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
The first is

1419
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
He didn't

1420
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,143
The murder didn't stab Jennifer and stopping

1421
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
Summit 32

1422
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
Mostly targeted

1423
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,543
2

1424
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,847
He didn't yell quote die baby die

1425
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,175
There was a neighbor who heard the attack who said that

1426
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,479
The victim scream

1427
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,271
About how he was going to

1428
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
To kill the baby

1429
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,879
Match

1430
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
I think he's just embellishing

1431
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,231
Get more emotional to his audience

1432
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,023
And make a cognitively twitch

1433
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
This murder

1434
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
And abortions

1435
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
I'm third thing is a big

1436
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
Reason to change

1437
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,799
Existing law in New York

1438
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,383
Is because the law

1439
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,967
Except criminalizing appropriate Healthcare

1440
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,087
If you were a woman there who found under 6 months of pregnancy

1441
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
Fetus in your room was unviable

1442
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
Or wouldn't survive after birth

1443
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
But your health wasn't

1444
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
Risk it would be murder for the doctor

1445
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
Remove the unviable

1446
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Fetus from your body

1447
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,119
Essentially you'd have to go to a different state or live

1448
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
For 3 months in the state of

1449
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
Unbelievable emotional devastation

1450
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
But no one should have to

1451
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,359
New York state made abortions legal in 1970

1452
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
Before Roe versus Wade

1453
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,455
What is never update their state statutes

1454
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,271
I thought the archaic language remained until very

1455
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,623
Literally all the old language did was make it harder on women

1456
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,415
Simpson cases like the one houses

1457
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:55,743
About there's still plenty of criminal charges on the books

1458
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
New language attitude

1459
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,631
Clear the only permit

1460
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,959
To perform abortions are licensed Healthcare practitioner

1461
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:11,103
So the idea that this guy who is dabbing this woman that's just a late-term abortion is nonsense

1462
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
It doesn't reply at all

1463
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,919
Legitimately

1464
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
All this is about protecting a woman's right to choose

1465
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
And many other states are

1466
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
For pastor York

1467
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
And terms

1468
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
Protecting that right

1469
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
Even considering

1470
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
This new

1471
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
Update to the light

1472
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
It isn't it tragic

1473
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
Situation where that woman

1474
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Boyfriend

1475
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,375
Wanted to murder her

1476
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Whatever is it

1477
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,215
Motivation for that murder is

1478
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
Was not public by the time

1479
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031
Alex

1480
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
Let God on errands.

1481
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Go to talk about this.

1482
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Yes

1483
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
He probably

1484
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
Did also want to kill

1485
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
I don't think that colors anything at all

1486
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
I don't think that makes Alex's argument make more sense

1487
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,367
I don't I think it makes everything

1488
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
Certainly

1489
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
But

1490
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,279
It's dude

1491
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,863
In Envy

1492
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
And that's that's the thing that's amazing

1493
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
To me about

1494
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,495
The way that the right-wing is

1495
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Is always

1496
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,408
But all they're really doing is harming women

1497
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,456
Like with 24 weeks

1498
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,272
What are they really criminalizing

1499
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
Are they criminalizing doctors

1500
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,136
No they're criminalizing women who are f******

1501
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Freaked out of their goddamn Minds

1502
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:32,256
Who trained actually

1503
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,328
Confirm anywhere because of 24-week laws or whatever it is

1504
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,144
And a train selfie

1505
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,520
That's what the that's what the law is

1506
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,360
It is not a deterrent but it is not something that's going to help anybody

1507
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,152
It is only something that is going to

1508
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,688
Criminalize the very idea

1509
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:54,272
Deal of being a woman as this debate has been happening

1510
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
I don't think it is

1511
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,880
It's

1512
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,928
I mean like in the last month or so

1513
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,488
A lot of conversations

1514
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,304
In public court is going to overturn Roe v Wade

1515
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,424
Who knows

1516
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Fairly sane

1517
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Because of this New York

1518
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
Launch

1519
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
It's triggered some of these

1520
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Everybody

1521
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
Go and read

1522
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
Some of the

1523
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
Women

1524
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,040
Who needed

1525
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,320
Late-term abortions

1526
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,600
We're not allowed to have

1527
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:33,696
Those sorts of stories are very publicly available to sub you can find

1528
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
New Yorker

1529
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,256
Huffington Post recently

1530
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
But if you read those stories

1531
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,960
And don't come away with it

1532
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,520
From that with a greater understanding of what

1533
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
The actual issue is

1534
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Then you're not paying

1535
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
There are

1536
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,736
It really struck me in one of the articles that I read in the New York

1537
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,832
Was the person who wrote the article is talking about

1538
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
The argument

1539
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,440
Legislative

1540
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,000
Rules about abortion

1541
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,536
Really hinges upon

1542
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:17,472
Like they walk

1543
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
Oh yeah

1544
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,032
Yeah

1545
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
Well I didn't even think about that

1546
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
Yeah do you have to make laws is

1547
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:30,272
Predicated on the idea that people is there

1548
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
Which is the world's you Alex presents

1549
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,880
VIP

1550
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,184
Murder

1551
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,488
Yeah reality every

1552
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Single.

1553
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,240
Talk to or pee

1554
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
People who have been in that

1555
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Situation

1556
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
I'm not looking

1557
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
To kill anybody

1558
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
There

1559
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Looking

1560
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
For appropriate

1561
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,736
I think it's like 1% of all

1562
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,552
Yeah

1563
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
Never light

1564
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,368
Decisions

1565
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
And then when we say this

1566
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,232
Somebody like Alex would say what about Coeur

1567
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,304
Right

1568
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,864
You have more typos

1569
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
If you weren't in that position

1570
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
Children Probz

1571
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
That's not about abortion

1572
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,824
As much as it is

1573
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,152
I would still get arrested

1574
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
Cuz of what he was doing

1575
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,968
I can't about

1576
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
I can imagine

1577
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,784
7 months pregnant

1578
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,088
And getting the news that

1579
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
Your child was

1580
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
Going to be stillborn

1581
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,256
And then and then having to carry

1582
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
Pregnancy

1583
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
Knowing that

1584
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,008
You're going to go through two months of

1585
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,032
F****** hell

1586
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
And then years of hell

1587
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
That is

1588
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,384
Unreal

1589
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,152
End

1590
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,456
Laura really protects

1591
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,296
No documents

1592
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:11,904
No ethically operating Doctor Who wouldn't have other reasons at their license

1593
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
Should probably be under

1594
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,464
Review whatever perform

1595
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
Like late-term

1596
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
Real late term abortion

1597
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
When there wasn't a good

1598
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:24,448
Whether it's the fetuses unviable outside of the body or is a risk to the woman

1599
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
That's

1600
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:30,336
So actually I had a bit of a naive position or just examined

1601
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,360
Position of like

1602
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,432
Jefferson Pointe there should be laws against abortion

1603
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,528
From looking into this a lot of these stories

1604
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,576
Looking at doctor's perspective

1605
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
I've come around

1606
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
To the point where now by position is

1607
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,512
There should be no laws about it all decisions made between doctors

1608
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Quite frankly

1609
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,144
Position

1610
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
I100

1611
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
I remember

1612
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
Growing up

1613
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:07,200
I remember being

1614
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
So f****** serious

1615
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:12,064
Hey I mean if you listen to the show you know a group of

1616
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
If you're new

1617
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,648
Welcome to the f****** Thunderdome I don't know what to tell you

1618
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
And my

1619
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
Vehemently

1620
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Anti-abortion

1621
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,280
.

1622
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,584
I remember being like 14 or

1623
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
15

1624
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,424
Knowing somebody who had gotten an abortion

1625
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
And having them communicate

1626
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,008
The entire thought process

1627
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
And that was

1628
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
It for me

1629
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,616
I was literally like no

1630
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Whenever

1631
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,944
It's your it's you

1632
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,344
I don't even think a baby is he liked it until your conscious I don't even know if you're a real thing

1633
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,184
Existence

1634
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,560
It's not okay only hurting a person

1635
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,448
People could have their basic reality would be handled by oversight

1636
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
Regulation

1637
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
The medical industry

1638
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,384
Regulations are there could be strengthened

1639
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,432
More oversight made

1640
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,992
Right to make sure the people are operating

1641
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Nafaqo

1642
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
Follows page

1643
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
Wishes and they're not active

1644
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
Ferociously

1645
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,904
All of

1646
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
The things you could hope

1647
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
Two stalls

1648
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,768
Legislatively or punitively

1649
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,328
You could handle through approach

1650
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
And I think it would

1651
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
Protect

1652
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,912
Vulnerable women

1653
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
Armoire

1654
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:36,288
Than any of this laudable absolutely

1655
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
So

1656
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,640
I don't know there's no there's no end is like

1657
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,200
Pointing out hypocrisy now

1658
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
Stupid

1659
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,784
It's stupid they don't give a fuk

1660
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,344
But the idea that the

1661
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
Same group of people who

1662
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
Want to make it in

1663
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,720
Possible for a woman to get an abortion

1664
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
What'd make it

1665
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
Impossible not to own a gun

1666
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,120
NeverEnding Lansing

1667
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,168
NeverEnding landscape

1668
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,240
There are even more

1669
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,264
Daddy f******

1670
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,336
Access

1671
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Preventative

1672
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
Control

1673
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:16,736
What's up

1674
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Darden favor of

1675
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,368
Like white access to the morning-after pill

1676
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
Contraception

1677
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:31,328
An honest you don't women you don't want women to participate don't want women

1678
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,632
At least then we can talk about that

1679
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:40,288
Instead of all this crap that's their legitimate position

1680
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
They said that you couldn't bring out over racism to win and they f****** did that

1681
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,400
Ugly

1682
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
I didn't enjoy necessarily

1683
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Alex

1684
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
His take on it

1685
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
The show on

1686
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,080
But

1687
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
He also

1688
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,408
Get to

1689
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
That's at 1

1690
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
George Soros

1691
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:23,552
MarketWatch

1692
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:26,880
And it's about the troubles that are fake

1693
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,464
They're a bunch of challenges from

1694
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Some things like that

1695
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,120
Who wrote this op-ed

1696
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
The challenges

1697
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,216
European Union itself faces

1698
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:41,984
How

1699
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,312
It probably is going to lead down a very bad Road

1700
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,848
Hey maybe there's some ways

1701
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,128
They can change

1702
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,176
The EU in order to

1703
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:50,944
To preserve

1704
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
You

1705
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
Keep these people satisfied

1706
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
Subway

1707
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,624
Not necessarily

1708
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,696
The article is basically the people need to wake up

1709
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
To the idea that

1710
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
The EU

1711
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,328
We'll probably end up breaking up

1712
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,632
What will come from that is

1713
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,704
The same troubles that the USSR sauce

1714
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
After

1715
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,032
Yeah he wasn't comparing

1716
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
The EU

1717
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:17,824
The USSR

1718
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,224
Imagine that accusation

1719
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
An example of another large

1720
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Group

1721
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
Ended up breaking up into constituent countries

1722
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,952
Right in the EU countries are all still

1723
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,512
Fairly Sovereign it right

1724
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,792
Unique

1725
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,376
He uses the Soviet Union as an example

1726
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Talking parrot

1727
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:46,240
You know right

1728
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,056
Just do this

1729
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,576
That pretty much tell you what's going on because Business Leaders

1730
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,952
Sophisticated audience Westshore

1731
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,048
George Soros

1732
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,400
Illinois

1733
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:23,104
In the euro

1734
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
Perceptive

1735
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:30,016
Sounds like

1736
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
He didn't say any of those

1737
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,368
Those aren't in the article at all

1738
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
Now it's

1739
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,952
Interesting cuz I was like I read the article doesn't say that

1740
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,232
Houses for sale

1741
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
You think that is

1742
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,584
One obvious example is

1743
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,888
Maliciously lying

1744
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,936
He knows that no one's going to go read the art

1745
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,472
That's one possibility

1746
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,544
Then he talks about it a little more

1747
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,104
I start to think maybe he's only read the

1748
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,920
Infowars article about this

1749
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,224
George Soros

1750
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,760
Who starts talking about

1751
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Post

1752
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
On Infowars

1753
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,624
Actually way worse than even that

1754
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,440
Let's go to California

1755
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Europe

1756
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,352
Maybe on the cusp of a nightmare

1757
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,400
It's not too late to wake up

1758
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,960
Eroded George

1759
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,056
Read this passage

1760
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,432
Infowars.com it's right to the quotes

1761
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,528
Future new world order

1762
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:43,744
The USSR

1763
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,584
For my 20 years plus on air

1764
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,376
USSR

1765
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,448
Alex's throws like a somebody read the headline

1766
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,520
Twitter an uproar over Soros

1767
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Comparison

1768
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
So I went to Infowars

1769
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:00,896
That headline

1770
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,224
That's not a boil down on Infowars

1771
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,296
That's a reposting of a Sputnik article

1772
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:14,720
That is Infowars reposting a Sputnik article critical of George Soros

1773
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:21,632
It's crazy it's crazy

1774
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:28,032
Paul Joseph Watson did a report this is a boil.

1775
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:32,128
A little bit for Christ's sake I don't

1776
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,920
But never have any

1777
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,712
Clean reporting or anything like that

1778
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,016
But I will say

1779
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,040
To do with

1780
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:45,440
The USSR and George Soros and it's coming from

1781
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:51,328
I'm going to say good friend going to say it's not bias it's not good

1782
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,424
Or however

1783
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:59,520
Not good when I saw it

1784
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,824
It's when you put an article in a pot

1785
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:09,504
Potters reloading the article doesn't realize

1786
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,880
No I mean a boil down is basically

1787
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Just

1788
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Taking

1789
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:22,560
Cirrhosis

1790
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:29,216
It is genuine whatever it is that that

1791
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,752
Means

1792
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
And idea enough to know that

1793
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,360
A human being should not be allowed to read that

1794
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
The fun game

1795
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,368
Reply but what's really fun about it

1796
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,416
What is he does most of it in his evil Soros

1797
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,232
Voice it would take us all day

1798
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,560
To listen to him paragraph

1799
01:33:54,816 --> 01:34:00,960
Because he just said for making through two paragraphs

1800
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,800
Here's the clip

1801
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,848
Of Alex doing it

1802
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,152
Critical error in his ability to read

1803
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
Which I've always said his

1804
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,200
Literacy is

1805
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
The problem

1806
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
I'll just tell you what

1807
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:21,952
He thinks that the article says infection inflection

1808
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:29,120
The upcoming elections

1809
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,168
Infection point

1810
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
Affection

1811
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
It deceives Alex

1812
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,808
Island

1813
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,368
Miss Whitton touched advocate.

1814
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
First

1815
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,208
Psoriasis name

1816
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,512
He's gone off on this infection risk

1817
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,048
Yeah this is not going to

1818
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,680
In his ear van like

1819
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,336
Inflection point is what the ark electricity

1820
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,128
Good ristobar

1821
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,176
In a second

1822
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,480
He's going to do another run

1823
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,320
For sure you going to realize

1824
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,416
Bankrupt him before we kill him

1825
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:39,776
Upcoming European elections oh George the best

1826
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,336
Laid plans of mice and men often do

1827
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,616
Stray

1828
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,528
Infection

1829
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:55,136
Project project project

1830
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:59,488
So he just does it again misreading of the article

1831
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
I kind of wish

1832
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:04,608
But also actually if you go to Infowars I don't know what

1833
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,632
Bought their using

1834
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,936
But I can understand how out

1835
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,704
Miss that out

1836
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
Yeah I'm not getting lost you should f****** know better and it's his website

1837
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:20,736
New Roman

1838
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Hey Goodrich

1839
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,864
He hasn't read this article that's on Infowars

1840
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,656
But naked doesn't know what's going on

1841
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,704
He just thinks he finds a word and

1842
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Respond it

1843
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,432
About that at all

1844
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,200
To the 13th

1845
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Wednesday

1846
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
This episode

1847
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,344
Nothing

1848
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
Fun places

1849
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,416
But we'll start it goes to

1850
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,952
Some places yes

1851
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,768
Google start here with I'd like to remind you

1852
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
The weather

1853
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,656
Islamophobic is s***

1854
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,728
Personally told his audience to murder is out of me

1855
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
Yes

1856
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:21,664
Also perpetuated islamophobic ideas that were completely inaccurate Muslim countries now.

1857
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:28,064
On the 11th

1858
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,624
A group as an other friend then suggest

1859
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,976
His audience that they should prepare for that other group

1860
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:39,072
Ensure that when that other needs to be killed supposed to be killed

1861
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:41,888
And then on the 12th

1862
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,936
Soros was supporting a Hitler

1863
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,496
Plan well yeah and he doesn't see the

1864
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,336
I do agree with your assessment

1865
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
But I'm more interested in

1866
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:52,896
Like he was

1867
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
Way off base on the 11

1868
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,504
Particularly about the Muslim country

1869
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,344
Then on the 12th

1870
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,392
He's off on this New York abortion

1871
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:07,232
Crazy far-field is Angela

1872
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,024
And then at the same time

1873
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:15,680
Doesn't disclose to his listeners the decision

1874
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:19,008
And Miss Reed's inflection as infection

1875
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,568
Hey just does this weird.

1876
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,592
Soros

1877
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,896
Do everything has been terrible

1878
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:31,296
Like from a professional standpoint commercial back on the 11th

1879
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,696
Dogs fight with

1880
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,120
Is how he starts to show on the 13

1881
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:51,776
Not particularly focused today and I've got

1882
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:57,408
Broadcast have been particularly piercing

1883
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,712
Research reports

1884
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:02,016
Everything because of the times demand it

1885
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:06,880
Individual

1886
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
That is

1887
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,096
Narcissistic bulshit

1888
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:21,472
Especially considering how bad is show is been lately

1889
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:26,592
This is gross stuff like that about me all the time and that's because I'm so down to earth

1890
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,128
It's not that I'm

1891
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,920
Good at anything

1892
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
What time is it

1893
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,480
Choir memes

1894
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
Step Up

1895
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,320
And release my greatness into the world

1896
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,648
If I were living in a less exciting time like perhaps

1897
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,768
Good idea podcast

1898
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
Probably not

1899
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
It's the times that have made me cry

1900
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
Sure

1901
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,240
I don't know all this is to say that I Galaxy starting out like

1902
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Real focused

1903
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,312
How to do a great job today

1904
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
Is going to be amazing

1905
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,616
In the show

1906
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,712
Turbo Force

1907
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,248
Before the show I don't know

1908
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,256
I think he's just he's just feeling himself

1909
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
Not judging

1910
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,864
But

1911
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,400
Issues

1912
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,192
And unfortunately

1913
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,216
Like you did

1914
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,056
Continuity-of-government stuff

1915
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,456
He now invalidates one of the only things

1916
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,736
Things that you and I

1917
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
Mutual

1918
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:44,160
What is it say that we should be legalized marijuana

1919
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:51,584
Procedure General

1920
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,120
Inside tonus

1921
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:58,240
Unconstitutional

1922
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,336
It stopped

1923
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
But on the border

1924
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Bar

1925
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
The door

1926
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,784
Boats.

1927
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:16,416
It's just

1928
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,208
El Chapo

1929
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
Right there

1930
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:22,560
He's talking about the ideas like season all of El Chapo's

1931
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:29,728
Settling

1932
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:33,824
Convicted Now in America

1933
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,592
Probably

1934
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
Properties

1935
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,408
Like the Mexican

1936
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
I think those are Mexican and we can just kill them

1937
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,880
Even muddying the waters

1938
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,416
Because in order to

1939
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,976
Create this wall

1940
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,560
Property property

1941
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,352
Like it's not the idea just

1942
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:01,472
The Civil asset forfeiture argument still involves the idea of life

1943
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,520
This is going to get into these people's properties

1944
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
If you want to build

1945
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:13,248
Otherwise why do you own property

1946
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,016
That's not the

1947
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:21,184
So the idea that I was bringing up like the Civil asset forfeiture when it's not civil asset forfeiture in terms of

1948
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,464
El Chapo's property

1949
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,536
Or assets is a preparation

1950
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
4

1951
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,840
Being fine with the eye

1952
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
Idea up

1953
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,376
People who have property

1954
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,168
Having a property

1955
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Aiken

1956
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,728
In order to

1957
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,520
Yes order to

1958
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
The wall

1959
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,080
He's doing this as a preemptive

1960
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
Waffling

1961
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
That's a bummer

1962
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
But

1963
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,480
What can you do

1964
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,808
Hey the more the more we dig

1965
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
The more he talked

1966
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Amorous

1967
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,648
You have to real Prince

1968
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,696
White people should own guns

1969
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
Those are the only

1970
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:01,888
It's the two pieces together.

1971
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
Chocolate and peanut butter

1972
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,800
Next

1973
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
Women are incapable of

1974
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Defending our speech

1975
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:24,160
Women and children down there still got to be men

1976
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,208
Real quick I got a pause because he's

1977
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
Banging out

1978
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:33,632
I know I know and Depeche Mode

1979
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,424
Truth is

1980
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:42,848
And it's hilarious to me because Alex twice

1981
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
It's so clear that you

1982
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,712
He's going through

1983
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,760
And the lyrics to that song are like

1984
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,808
Really right Wiki

1985
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,136
The whole song is all about

1986
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:59,744
You're going through some troubles now everything is bad because of your youth

1987
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,536
Adopted a Policy of Truth

1988
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,096
Yeah

1989
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,656
Wants to believe about himself

1990
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
He's playing at a bunch like

1991
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,728
I love the idea

1992
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,008
His emotion

1993
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,408
Eastbound down roundabout are Trucking

1994
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,832
I'm going to steal me a Silver Stallion

1995
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,184
You're being persecuted because you told the truth

1996
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,768
We're playing our of Elliott Smith

1997
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,448
Bereavement flights

1998
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,984
Depeche Mode

1999
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,264
One of them

2000
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:50,432
How many start the cliff over cuz I want to hear more about

2001
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:03,232
Women and children down there still got to be men

2002
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:09,632
Global experiment

2003
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:13,216
Fusion to Arrested Development

2004
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:18,848
Independence BC she really don't

2005
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,408
Species

2006
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,016
Week

2007
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Week

2008
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,832
Weeds

2009
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,624
Yeah that's that's pretty crazy

2010
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:39,840
Matrilineal Societies or I'm not going to go

2011
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Okay

2012
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,192
Well within

2013
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,728
Normal

2014
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,800
At what point

2015
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
Does defending the speed

2016
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,432
Just turn into murdering other

2017
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,248
I mean there's a thin line for Alex

2018
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:05,696
The five percent Nation nation of gods and Earths

2019
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:09,280
You cool and when I was hearing Alex talkin about this this PC

2020
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
Who can

2021
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,096
Protect it

2022
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,888
It kind of made me

2023
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,424
I heard echoes of it

2024
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,240
You know it doesn't stay in the 5% nation release

2025
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,264
Play the classical

2026
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,800
Understanding

2027
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:23,872
Next put out it was the idea that the black man

2028
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,176
Was God and the black woman was

2029
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:26,944
Was there earthquake

2030
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
And they lived in this sort of like

2031
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,528
Symbiotic

2032
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,088
The god over the Earth

2033
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
The Earth supporting

2034
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,880
God

2035
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:37,696
Alex is describing a very similar relationship

2036
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,976
Between men and women

2037
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,048
You take out the Islamic roots and

2038
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,096
You know all that stuff

2039
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:48,704
You're talkin about are the ones who protect the species in Brandon

2040
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,776
Play the subservient role

2041
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,080
Without the man the women or nothing

2042
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,944
Right there is the exact same sort of dichotomy there

2043
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,344
Have we considered letting women

2044
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,392
Instead of like the men

2045
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,952
Having a symbiotic relationship with the women

2046
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,304
Just letting women have all the control and then keeping men as pets

2047
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,864
Has reconsidered the Ghostface Killah

2048
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,400
Is actually Alex Jones

2049
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,472
That could be true

2050
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,896
Now their body type

2051
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:37,856
No

2052
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,464
That's a lot of nonsense

2053
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:47,328
Over the course of the last like that are no sense Rodger got arrested

2054
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,632
Alex has been really

2055
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,704
I would say

2056
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,496
With restraint

2057
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
F*** off

2058
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:03,712

2063
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,608
This is Alex. I like it

2064
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
He is

2065
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
Joel mad at Rodger Stone

2066
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
But he can't get really mad

2067
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,312
I really think of

2068
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,640
Rodger Stone

2069
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,664

Knew him a little bit and he knew stuff about you

2074
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:49,024
Never fight with him you would let whatever I don't know parasail

Glide gently down to the jail that is in going to prison

01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
You're working with Rodger Stone

2119
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,568
The show Alex discusses

2120
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,640
Signifiers of races

2121
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,200
His life

2122
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,480
No

2123
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:56,576
This is part of a conversation

2124
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,600
The yard Virginia

2125
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,208
Hey

2126
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,352
I'm not thrilled that either

2127
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:12,192
Thoughts

2128
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:12,960
About

2129
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,568

Entirely

2133
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
Joe Rogan

2134
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:35,232
If you make dressing up in a KKK outfits

2135
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
Which I think is the context

2136
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:49,056
That is the capital

2137
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:54,432
So apparently black face and wearing a Klan outfit

2138
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,832
Yeah

2139
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:06,208
I don't know if I support

2140
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,744
Lime

2141
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,536
Necessarily

2142
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:15,936
Very hard I hope everybody got that probably is a Halloween costume

2143
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,752
It would be okay

2144
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
Honda

2145
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,104
Fun of the clan with the cost

2146
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,920
Yeah

2147
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:33,088
What if you were able to find some way to make a statement out of the

2148
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:38,976
Larger design of the costume all except that contact you would like that person

2149
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,512
That would also

2150
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,304
Sure

2151
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,864
I'm saying

2152
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,888
You could stretch Alex

2153
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:49,216
Yeah. Haha

2154
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:54,080
He is absolutely saying that sometimes black face is pretty cool

2155
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:02,784
Inflated throat politically or whatever

2156
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:08,160
Responding it just didn't go great for it

2157
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,464
Alyssa nurse

2158
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,256
A clip of Rogan

2159
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,536
Years ago

2160
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,352
Talking about

2161
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,656
It's like a 30-second clip I'm not sure

2162
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,984
It doesn't matter with contacts

2163
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,544
He's talking about going to see the planet

2164
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:28,640
In like a mostly black neighborhood

2165
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:33,248
You go to the theatre and Rogan says I walked into theater and we walked

2166
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:37,344
Which is richest racist on its face

2167
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,648
But as Alex keeps trying to

2168
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,184
Who is conversation

2169
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,512
Rogan is a comedian

2170
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Antojitos

2171
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:48,352
You trying to Walk This Way

2172
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,632
He's like

2173
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,168
I'm not

2174
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,448
You said that

2175
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,472
Because you're

2176
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,520
You're not a racist

2177
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,312
I'm in the process

2178
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:00,384
He talks about how Rogan has a couple black children

2179
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,408
He's adopted

2180
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:04,736
Which you don't want people to know that it's not public

2181
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:10,368
I don't know if it is or isn't it but it isn't really f***** up right now

2182
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,928
In terms of putting Jose business in the street

2183
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:16,256
And not because they're black children or anything like that

2184
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,304
His personal life that he tries to keep

2185
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:21,376
Whatever whatever it is like a human

2186
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,960
She has adopted or

2187
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,240
Whatever the case

2188
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,800
She doesn't want that there that is

2189
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:29,824
Right

2190
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
Keep private

2191
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:31,872
Because

2192
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,408
In the same way

2193
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,176
Alex

2194
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,456
Professor tranky

2195
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,224
Keep his children

2196
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Private

2197
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
You have a right

2198
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,808
To that as a public figure

2199
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,832
Your children aren't

2200
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:41,600
An extension of

2201
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,928
Yourself right if Rogan was trying to keep

2202
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,952
Information about his kids

2203
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,000
And Alex's

2204
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,560
Just blowing hard

2205
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:53,376
Service argument that I'm not calling you a racist

2206
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,656
Because

2207
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,192
The children are black

2208
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,496
Bad

2209
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
Alex

2210
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,056
Yeah

2211
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:04,896
Yeah this clip of Rogan being

2212
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,176
Being race

2213
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,456
Right

2214
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,528
He's trying to walk a weird line with

2215
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,808
With that to where he's like

2216
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,368
If I said stuff like that

2217
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,928
Everyone will be mad at you me

2218
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,976
But you get away with it

2219
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,280
Good laugh

2220
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:24,096
The left would pillory me for this

2221
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,888
Because what they do is fine

2222
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:28,960
Clips and bring it to everyone's attention to attack person

2223
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:34,848
Right Edge literally 1121

2224
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,920
An example of

2225
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,200
But how you get away with

2226
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:41,504
So Alex is going to discuss.

2227
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,040
We get into it

2228
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,576
I just want to make clear that I don't

2229
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,392
Support

2230
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,416
This b*******

2231
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,464
You know I don't think

2232
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,560
I don't think Rogan's right

2233
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:58,912
IFixit Alex is right in his criticism

2234
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,216
F****** racist absolutely

2235
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,264
The context is there than he's making

2236
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
Is correct

2237
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,456
Alex is the wrong person to make that assessment

2238
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,760
Right big much like the people

2239
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,040
Complaining about representative

2240
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:15,808
Bar

2241
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,136
Being anti-semitic and save tweeted out

2242
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,416
Soros memes

2243
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,232
Incapable

2244
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,256
Making this argument

2245
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,024
Without it going

2246
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,816
So far off the rail

2247
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,608
I can't stress this

2248
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,144
Alex has no business

2249
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
Being involved

2250
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,960
Helps no business

2251
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:35,264
And as I'm saying

2252
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,544
It goes off the

2253
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,080
So hard

2254
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:38,848
So fast

2255
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,128
Alexandra

2256
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:42,176
So racist

2257
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,712
In trying to

2258
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,992
Condemn Joe Rogan

2259
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,784
For this 30-second clip

2260
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,064
Of Joby

2261
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,512
So here's the first clip

2262
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,072
Eyewear Alex discusses that clip of Rogan

2263
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,096
And then

2264
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:05,472
It's crazy to me how fast this goes bad

2265
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,752
Because it didn't have to

2266
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:15,968
Here's how he gets away with stuff like this all the time everyone comes down on

2267
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
Call me for my speech

2268
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,528
Please buy brain

2269
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,488
I'm a victim by virtue of this existing and no one yelling about it

2270
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:30,304
Vibrate for whataboutism

2271
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:36,960
Writ large without any like and also here's why it's fine for me to be right

2272
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,288
So fat

2273
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,128
I've been destroyed and then you sit there

2274
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,456
And compare black people to Planet of the Apes

2275
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,480
Who are you

2276
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,040
Beyond blackface

2277
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:53,344
And I supposedly A-OK

2278
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,904
Racist

2279
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:59,232
World champion

2280
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:05,632
I'll stand there.

2281
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,664
White people

2282
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,016
Where the super Supergirl

2283
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,648
You can have the whole left this thing

2284
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,208
Bro

2285
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,512
Do it

2286
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:39,168
The Westbank

2287
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:42,496
Joe

2288
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,312
You can't compare black people to Apes

2289
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,360
Also

2290
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,712
So you were right

2291
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
What

2292
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
What was that

2293
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,832
Who is Brave

2294
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,624
Speak the word those were

2295
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392
It was a

2296
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
Rippling

2297
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,768
Roebling point

2298
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:14,496
I don't understand

2299
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,800
It's to make Rogan look worse

2300
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,080
What is it

2301
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:18,848
Yeah

2302
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,896
How

2303
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:27,808
I'm not sure if you can look worse

2304
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:30,112
Self look like

2305
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,416
Come on

2306
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
As it was

2307
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:37,792
Cold

2308
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:44,192
Pretty solid tip I got my wires crossed

2309
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:50,592
For some reason the newest one was the Burton one

2310
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:59,808
Did I ever tell you about why would you do that other than to make yourself look like that came out back when I worked at that

2311
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,344
Movie theater

2312
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,952
On Thursday nights

2313
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:09,280
The projection is to build the movie and then you have to screen it

2314
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,048
To make sure that

2315
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:14,656
You built it correctly

2316
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,936
You turn into a party

2317
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:17,984
And so all of us would get together

2318
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,800
Cedar are managers were over 21

2319
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:27,200
Everybody can rule.

2320
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,272
None of us just watching a movie the night before it comes out getting wasted

2321
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:33,856
Remake of Planet of the Apes

2322
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,904
I threw most of it we're drinking we are having

2323
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
A real bad

2324
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,768
Is a bad movie

2325
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,792
He wasn't the one about us

2326
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,216
He was like the whole time at the end when they're like

2327
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,240
You coming back

2328
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,264
2

2329
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,312
The resolution of the movie

2330
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
Flying back

2331
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:55,872
And Washington

2332
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:58,176
Rick is just sitting there with his arms crossed

2333
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,200
Abe Lincoln

2334
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Abe Lincoln

2335
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,504
Abe Lincoln

2336
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,880
A blanket

2337
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:10,464
Add shot in April

2338
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:16,864
Literally fell to his knees escaped

2339
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:23,264
Burton I've been in full I've been in full movie theaters

2340
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:31,968
Anna movie

2341
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:38,368
Music explosion mostly empty movie theater memory will live with me till the day I die

2342
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
F****** die

2343
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,952
See I'm not sure what Alex is trying

2344
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,000
I don't think

2345
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,792
He's ventured

2346
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,816
How far

2347
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,840
Into racist

2348
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,376
Territory

2349
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,400
Condemning

2350
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,448
Dirosa problems

2351
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,216
I think he's

2352
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,800
Dancing around ideas that he wants to make belt like all of it look

2353
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,360
Is there a mutual dependence

2354
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,152
Prefer to say

2355
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,992
Whatever puts

2356
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:07,552
Simultaneously trying to defend race

2357
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:09,856
Excuse racism

2358
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,392
And condemn

2359
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
At the same time

2360
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,184
Right

2361
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
It gets worse

2362
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,048
Even though it is

2363
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,608
Conditionally

2364
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:22,144
Because of where we're going to

2365
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
Go

2366
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:29,824
His next Cliff Alex talks about going to a party where people weren't

2367
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,384
This party items

2368
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,432
As a plural his thing

2369
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,968
I don't think

2370
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:38,784
This sounds like a lot of stories

2371
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:44,160
This

2372
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,952
To be like he got invited to a

2373
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,744
Legit blackface party

2374
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,584
I don't know if that was the

2375
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,632
The theme of the party I don't know

2376
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,936
Questions

2377
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:56,960
Explain it

2378
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,544
I don't like the

2379
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,824
Governor Northam

2380
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,640
He's just kill babies after they're born that's why

2381
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:09,760
What are the South 2527 30 years ago a Democrat

2382
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:16,160
Yeah

2383
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:20,768
I showed up like 10 years ago

2384
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:28,960
Because I don't want to have some celebration thinking I'm better than somebody

2385
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:35,104
I'm sick of it

2386
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:42,784
He was real yes people though

2387
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:45,856
Racism

2388
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:00,960
I know you're not racing

2389
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:03,520
Itsfunneh

2390
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,824
Interracial Joe switcher true like that

2391
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:10,176
Most interracial p*** spot in the South and your older jokes about Lola

2392
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,320
I don't like your job

2393
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:22,208
The left wants to protect racism on everything

2394
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:23,232
Yeah

2395
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,000
Didn't happen

2396
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,304
By the way also he shows up for Halloween

2397
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,352
Party World

2398
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,448
Yeah that doesn't sound right at all

2399
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,264
I don't believe that

2400
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:40,384
They were dressed up like a wrong

2401
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,712
That's the only way

2402
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:46,784
Just dressed like James

2403
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:53,184
Malcolm X

2404
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,232
Where you hold a card up over your head

2405
02:06:55,744 --> 02:07:00,608
Guess who you are and he was like

2406
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:03,936
Problems with this clip of rogue

2407
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,520
Whatever but I think of this next cliff

2408
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:08,288
He criticizes

2409
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,056
Is the wrong

2410
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:10,080
Talked about it

2411
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,384
His pretty much

2412
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,064
How do you say your daughter is a night

2413
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:24,160
Hey man it's you up on your sanctimonious hours here bro

2414
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,048
Pull somebody's head off

2415
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:37,984
I'll beat the big old black guy

2416
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,568
Baby

2417
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,896
But you

2418
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,200
Pull crap like that

2419
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:52,576
I can't imagine a worse 32nd

2420
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,624
Of Annapolis

2421
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,232
Yeah

2422
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:04,608
Like very he's like

2423
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:10,240
No black people in they found out who the real life

2424
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:11,776
Inception is like

2425
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:14,336
Three stages deeper in racism

2426
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,152
That's the most racist

2427
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,688
You can say

2428
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:25,600
Zone understand

2429
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,672
Alex

2430
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:33,280
None of this is good

2431
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,632
I'm a very goal-oriented

2432
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
I win

2433
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:46,080
I am also trying to

2434
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:53,248
Yeah you're actionable towards the desired outcome

2435
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,368
Is to make Joe

2436
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,928
Look like a racist

2437
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,744
Honestly

2438
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,048
I think another goal that you would

2439
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:06,816
The unwilling

2440
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:08,096
Is

2441
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:10,144
Make Joe feel the pain

2442
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,168
That I feel

2443
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,520
That would present weakness

2444
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,288
I was like

2445
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,056
I don't think

2446
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,360
I don't think anyone knows how hurt I am

2447
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:24,736
I thought he was my friend that sort of

2448
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:28,320
That sort of thing would be unmasculine

2449
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,344
You wouldn't allow him

2450
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,768
Trying to show

2451
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,536
That

2452
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,584
Even though you have said some races

2453
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,608
Just things in the past

2454
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,400
I know you are not right

2455
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:45,216
And you would not be pilloried

2456
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,752
The same way that I am

2457
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:50,080
For saying the racist things that I have braces

2458
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,408
If your goal is

2459
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,176
To do that

2460
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,736
Your goal should also be

2461
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:02,624
Not to be more of a racist than can be conceived of by Joe Rogan

2462
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,440
In terms of

2463
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:07,744
The things that Rogan said definitely

2464
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:11,072
Sing in response to

2465
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:16,448
Imply I'm about to have also so much of Alex's

2466
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:19,264
Other things he's said in the past as we've documented

2467
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,544
Over and over

2468
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,312
Over again

2469
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,336
On this podcast

2470
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:25,920
Way more racist than Joe making a joke

2471
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,224
That is absolutely racist

2472
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,248
About

2473
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,040
A black movie theater being playing video

2474
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,576
Right

2475
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,624
Alex's career as

2476
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,904
Highlights

2477
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,744
But it is more fun

2478
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,560
In the same conversation Alex's beating

2479
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,352
Worse than what that clip

2480
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
Exactly

2481
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:47,936
You know what

2482
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,728
Joe you said that stuff

2483
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,264
And that's racist stuff

2484
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,824
And if

2485
02:10:54,336 --> 02:11:00,480
But at the same time whenever I say the n-word to Edwards

2486
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,784
All the time

2487
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,320
Alex

2488
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:10,720
What makes it worse

2489
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:12,768
I know that you're not racing

2490
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:15,328
I know that you're joking

2491
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:17,888
But I'm going to try and

2492
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,680
You as if I believe

2493
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,216
Do you were racist

2494
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:27,616
I want you to whatever consequences of being racist even though I know why

2495
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,808
Absolutely

2496
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,600
Which would people say

2497
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,648
And I would love to have that

2498
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:43,744
Conversation

2499
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:47,584
Look like that

2500
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:50,144
What are you doing

2501
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,936
Explains into like

2502
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,472
Crazy

2503
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:56,544
That was all

2504
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,616
Outtakes

2505
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,640
Another step

2506
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:02,944
It gets even more racist

2507
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:05,248
But if you thought that was bad

2508
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,576
That was terrible how can I get worse

2509
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,392
Well because he starts to bring pseudoscience

2510
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:16,256
Guilty

2511
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,584
Northern European

2512
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:21,376
No

2513
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:23,168
Average stop

2514
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:27,008
For the highest IQ of any group of people

2515
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:29,824
Put a. On that sentence now and just move on

2516
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,408
Please

2517
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:36,992
We don't need bell curve place you've got to stop

2518
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:40,832
That on average white people or Japanese ride up there

2519
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,392
Give Garcia

2520
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:48,000
It doesn't mean

2521
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,280
They're on that curve

2522
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:53,120
Well for our Russian

2523
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,776
Matters

2524
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:03,104
Test isn't that stuff cuz

2525
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,128
It's what you're measuring

2526
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,664
I want to see this really quick

2527
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:09,760
This is far too complicated of a topic for us to cover in-depth right now

2528
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:12,576
Please everyone

2529
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:17,952
Anyone is making an argument that there are differences and IQ that are attributable

2530
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:20,512
Is doing Soca support white supremacy

2531
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:26,144
Having a quote exchange of dangerous is there any b******* like that

2532
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:30,496
Discredited Theory

2533
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:33,568
An excuse to never have to confront the social cultural and

2534
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
They've enjoyed

2535
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:38,688
Which are built on the back of the social cultural and economic

2536
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,712
Disadvantages

2537
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,248
Other populations have been

2538
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:42,016
Subjected to

2539
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:44,832
The primary function of thinking along these

2540
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,112
These narratives

2541
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:51,488
Perpetuated is to create the appearance of a scientific sounding way to blame marginalized

2542
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:53,792
Communities for their own marginalization

2543
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,072
Pure and simple

2544
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:00,704
Many of these ideas proponents are inspired by Charles Marie's 1994 book

2545
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
The bell curve

2546
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,752
Which Alex even

2547
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,920
Find there's one book that everybody should light on fire

2548
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:12,224
Brooke Marie

2549
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,272
Completely Miss uses data to arrive

2550
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:17,088
Coke near inescapable conclusion

2551
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,112
The differences seem

2552
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:20,928
Between white and black IQ scores as the result

2553
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:24,768
Likes of Sam Harris

2554
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:28,352
Notion of race

2555
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,888
Positive differences

2556
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:31,936
And IQ is taken on a new life.

2557
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:34,240
These days when there is no basis in science

2558
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,520
Around that

2559
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:37,824
There are racial differences

2560
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,384
IQ scores

2561
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,408
But the idea of

2562
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
Positive

2563
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:43,200
The property between

2564
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,736
Is a leap that is

2565
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,760
Way too far

2566
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,576
Deeply f*****

2567
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,368
And it's one of the weird things

2568
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,904
Allsorts

2569
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
Savjz

2570
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:55,488
Intellectual dark web worlds

2571
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,816
Like you see it with Sam Harris and his acolytes

2572
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:00,608
These people like Dave Rubin

2573
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:02,144
It's coronavirus Diaz around

2574
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,704
Stefan molyneux makes

2575
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,240
A lot of mileage out of it

2576
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,776
But it's not something

2577
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,824
Sing that I've really heard Alex talk

2578
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,592
Much about

2579
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:15,968
And it's coming in the middle of a discussion of Rogan

2580
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:19,552
And in the same ways it the last time he went

2581
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,856
Load it off on Rogan

2582
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,928
He did that Project Camelot impression

2583
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:26,208
Where he started doing like

2584
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,512
You back

2585
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,792
Crazy things are

2586
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,912
I think this is another return

2587
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:38,240
This reference to the bell curve and race realism

2588
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,520
And this nonsense

2589
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,544
I think it's in a

2590
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,360
Appeal to the listeners of Rogan show

2591
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:45,408
That are the Sam Harris actor

2592
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,968
People who are into

2593
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,016
Disable Dia of like

2594
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,552
Scientific racism

2595
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,856
As opposed to emotional races

2596
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,392
That

2597
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:58,208
Did you tell him

2598
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,512
Cuz he doesn't know this.

2599
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,536
He's an ocean

2600
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,072
He's present

2601
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:06,912
In the Rogan

2602
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,472
That's f***

2603
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,312
Springs

2604
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:19,968
I would much rather you be intellectually honest with yourself

2605
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,736
Just say

2606
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:23,808
I don't like people who don't look like me

2607
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:26,368
Then try and pretend that there are

2608
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:28,416
Genetic reasons

2609
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,696
F*** off

2610
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:32,768
F*** you for somebody who constantly says

2611
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:36,864
F*** you

2612
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:40,960
It's a coward the Cowardly way to couch

2613
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:42,752
Whatever you want

2614
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,128
If you were just like

2615
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:50,688
I am uncomfortable with different

2616
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,480
The only reason

2617
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,272
Better is that

2618
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,320
You with the actual issue

2619
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,600
Exactly

2620
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:59,392
Would you hide behind these sorts of

2621
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,672
Over intellect

2622
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:01,952
Actualized

2623
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:05,024
You end up having to have conversation

2624
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,304
They're pedantic

2625
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,328
Nothing

2626
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:09,120
And they rely on

2627
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:12,448
Misusing studies overhears and stuff like that

2628
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:15,776
Never end up getting

2629
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
Lightworks

2630
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,824
You can make progress

2631
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,872
Towards what is underlying

2632
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,896
Ford

2633
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:27,296
No it's the new way of using the Bible to justify slavery really like the guy

2634
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:38,304
What you just touchdowns

2635
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,840
Is that like a lot of

2636
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,864
These people in these

2637
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,472
These these sort of race IQ science

2638
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,496
Computer these days

2639
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:51,104
Public policy doesn't really matter

2640
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,152
Exactly gives a s***

2641
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:54,432
Because these

2642
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:56,480
Communities in these populations

2643
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:58,272
Just intrinsically.

2644
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:00,832
It doesn't matter if you give resources

2645
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:02,368
Towards those communities

2646
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:04,160
School and after-school programs

2647
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:10,816
Stuff like that doesn't matter the radar cuz they are intrinsically worse which is a function

2648
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,096
White supremacist

2649
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:13,632
Whole point

2650
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:15,936
The whole point you f****** nailed it

2651
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,216
H2se

2652
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,288
Let's not

2653
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:22,080
Worry about putting

2654
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:23,360
Resources

2655
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:24,128
Into

2656
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,152
Inglewood

2657
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:34,112
Swan

2658
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:35,648
It's science thing that

2659
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:36,416
Englewood does

2660
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,696
Deserve resources

2661
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:40,512
And so and let's all just go away

2662
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:46,912
No we're good people they deserve rights

2663
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:51,264
Them put that takes it that takes away from those super high IQ White

2664
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,288
Kids

2665
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,312
Could use those

2666
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,080
Right

2667
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:58,688
There's go f*** yourself this very very complicated

2668
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,456
Issuance

2669
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:02,784
I think

2670
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,320
Things that we've expressed

2671
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,088
Tube bender

2672
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,096
Invited to any public policy on

2673
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:16,864
School debate

2674
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,656
Nobody's nobody's asking me like

2675
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:23,264
Hey Jordan how about you go participate

2676
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,080
School in charter schools and all that

2677
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,248
So in that last clip

2678
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:34,528
European

2679
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:39,136
I have a higher IQ because of

2680
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,416
Being a European

2681
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:44,256
With a higher IQ

2682
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:48,864
That's white people's favorite thing to do is be like they're yellow

2683
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:52,960
Not really

2684
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:54,496
He even matches up with

2685
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:55,520
IQ scores

2686
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:57,312
Ashkenazi Jews

2687
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,592
Much higher

2688
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:05,504
But

2689
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,040
But be that as it may

2690
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:09,600
The issue

2691
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:10,880
These like this

2692
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,160
Because he is a white

2693
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,952
He is gifted

2694
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,976
With the tire

2695
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,048
Japanese people are also in the mix

2696
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,328
Up there

2697
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,888
But then Alex starts

2698
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:23,680
Alex

2699
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,472
Clip about why

2700
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:29,824
From where

2701
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:33,408
Really bad idea people in his

2702
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,688
Mcmillions

2703
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,480
Have hierarchy

2704
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,248
Accused

2705
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:38,272
And it's a problem it's

2706
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:41,088
Problem because what he describes as

2707
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:42,368
The reason

2708
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:44,672
These Europeans have higher IQ

2709
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:47,232
From a evolutionary perspective

2710
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,792
Trying to play

2711
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:50,560
Did the Japanese

2712
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:52,352
These people he also thinks

2713
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:56,960
Have iiq and it falls apart

2714
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:59,264
I know you're chomping at the bit I'm sorry

2715
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,032
Please

2716
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:10,016
Black people

2717
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:11,552
John

2718
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,928
Wife has the highest IQ

2719
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:22,560
Well you better have an IQ

2720
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:26,144
Thousand years in Frozen Wasteland

2721
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:33,568
Africa

2722
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,664
Terraria skin

2723
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
How fast you were

2724
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:47,904
What about long-term strategic thinking

2725
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:52,512
Here and I criticize Joe

2726
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,816
Black people dude

2727
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:55,840
We are

2728
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:24,000
Electricity has airplanes in Wipeout

2729
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:31,424
Isn't it funny that they throw at the board

2730
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:35,520
Which fails to that's it

2731
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:36,800
And also

2732
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:41,408
Really terrible like

2733
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,248
I don't fully understand exactly

2734
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,784
That's trying to

2735
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,320
Put forth

2736
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,392
So the idea of like you have to get home at a certain time

2737
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:52,416
Fresa.

2738
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,952
Therefore intelligence

2739
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:54,720
Uvalde

2740
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:55,744
But

2741
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,792
He also is saying that in

2742
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,840
In around the equator

2743
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,608
You had to have

2744
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,376
Cunning

2745
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:03,168
Which is 2 mi a form of

2746
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:03,936
Intelligent

2747
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:06,496
Well I think

2748
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,520
Suites in order

2749
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:09,056
To deal with

2750
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:11,872
Bokeelia

2751
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:12,896
Auto kill you

2752
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:17,760
There are a lot more cold.

2753
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:20,064
Spin the wheel

2754
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:20,832
That's yes

2755
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:21,600
I mean that's just

2756
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:22,624
Atlee

2757
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:29,536
It's it's

2758
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
Deeply

2759
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,352
Anthropological

2760
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,120
Hunting

2761
02:23:33,376 --> 02:23:34,912
Cunning is the

2762
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,192
Very race

2763
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:37,984
This way that people miss it

2764
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:39,776
Well

2765
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:42,848
Describe

2766
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:46,944
LeBron James isn't very smart

2767
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,968
But

2768
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:49,504
He's really good at basketball because he's

2769
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,320
He has a f******

2770
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:56,672
Photogenic memory and can recall individual possessions like a goddamn

2771
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:59,488
F****** Savant it's the word

2772
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:05,376
Particular

2773
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:09,728
It's the code word to describe intelligence

2774
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:11,008
People that you don't want

2775
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,032
To ascribe to

2776
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,080
T-shirts of arguments of always

2777
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:17,664
Today they are

2778
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
Used

2779
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
Recycled

2780
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:20,992
And it's

2781
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:21,760
It's gross

2782
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,040
It's incredible growth

2783
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,832
Now at the end of that clip

2784
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,856
Alex

2785
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:31,744
Yeah I'm not I'm not on board with that specific example

2786
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:34,048
It's hilarious

2787
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:34,816
Is OverWatch

2788
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:37,888
Because none of them are attributable to watch

2789
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:39,936
Awesome it's so awesome

2790
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,704
Cuz that would

2791
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:41,728
Terrible

2792
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,264
In the middle of the

2793
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,800
I think about this a lot

2794
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:46,080
The way she goes out to break

2795
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,128
Is always so triumphant

2796
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,664
But whatever you saying it was

2797
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:56,064
The middle like you had to do 5 more minutes to go

2798
02:24:56,320 --> 02:25:00,928
Most of the time

2799
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:05,280
Did Leanne order rile people

2800
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:07,840
I do all that s***

2801
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:08,608
Breather

2802
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:12,192
Have a shot of whiskey or whatever

2803
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:17,312
So the three things he chooses to talk about the people

2804
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:20,896
Besides for our electricity airplanes and Medicine

2805
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:26,784
Now let's look at those things one-by-one the real history behind them

2806
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:28,576
To start talking s*** to

2807
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:30,112
Electricity research

2808
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:34,464
Electricity may have been developed in harness by largely European scientist

2809
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:38,048
But there also was a theory out there that between * 650

2810
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,584
To 150

2811
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,608
BCE

2812
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,376
People living in

2813
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,656
What's now a wreck

2814
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:48,032
Had knowledge of electroplating is evidenced by the archaeological find called the Baghdad battery

2815
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:54,944
People are kind of split on the hypothesis put but there's a lot of controversy about this

2816
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:58,528
People who have

2817
02:25:58,784 --> 02:25:59,808
Of what that artifact

2818
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:01,344
Actually used for

2819
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,136
And whether or not it was actually Eve

2820
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:03,904
Even the battery

2821
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:07,744
So honestly Europeans may be able to take credit for most of the

2822
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:09,024
Electricity

2823
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,816
But that baby Drew

2824
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:15,680
Although there were also cultures who the word for lightning is exactly the same thing as the word

2825
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,704
Electric eel

2826
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:20,288
Understanding of the nature of of Alexa

2827
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,336
Just some expense but that doesn't

2828
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:25,920
Steps made two harnesses

2829
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,992
Also spoiler alert

2830
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:31,040
Baghdad battery

2831
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:36,416
Because of the 16 years of

2832
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:38,464
Pretty much consistent War

2833
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:42,816
Whatever progress could be made

2834
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,096
Towards finding other

2835
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:44,864
Evidence to

2836
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,912
Reinforce that theory or anything

2837
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:47,680
Nothing like that

2838
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,776
Memorex

2839
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:59,968
There will never actually

2840
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,760
I think it's very interesting

2841
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:02,784
Possibility

2842
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,808
That was a battery

2843
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:06,624
But it's also possible that that hypothesis

2844
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,648
Is entirely wrong

2845
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,696
It's just the

2846
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,720
The finding

2847
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:11,744
Various

2848
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:15,072
Possible

2849
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:20,704
Accepted version of the reality that Alex is operating under is that like for Aviation

2850
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:24,544
Brother's got a crazy idea

2851
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,592
And then created the technology Idaho

2852
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:29,920
Unfortunately that is not accurate at all

2853
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:33,760
Legends of people flying go way back but probably don't

2854
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:34,784
Depict reality

2855
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,600
For instance like Icarus probably didn't actually have wipes

2856
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,904
Galveston

2857
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:40,928
Do all the ship

2858
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,464
However.

2859
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,488
Concepts involved

2860
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:47,840
In the development of Aviation the roots are not in the West

2861
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:53,216
In China in the fifth century BCE Lou Brock

2862
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:54,240
And Moody

2863
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:55,520
I invented the kite

2864
02:27:56,032 --> 02:28:00,384
And immediately after that fact after that development

2865
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,408
Interesting application

2866
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:02,688
New technology

2867
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,272
Their contemporary contemporary reports

2868
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:09,344
It's done kites were able to lift man into the air

2869
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,368
But the first

2870
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:11,392
Man flight

2871
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:13,184
Ever occurred in China in

2872
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:15,232
559

2873
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,256
Using kites

2874
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,024
Technology

2875
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:20,096
The idea for many of the elements that would allow the

2876
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:22,656
The creation of the helicopter words

2877
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,192
From a bamboo

2878
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:24,960
Vice that was

2879
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:29,056
The underlying technology

2880
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:31,616
Hot air balloons of stimuli understood by the

2881
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,152
Back to his far back

2882
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,432
Isaac 3rd century

2883
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:39,040
Much of the advances

2884
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,088
Invented in

2885
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:41,856
Longest

2886
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:46,208
But never took their there took the logical destructive

2887
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:48,000
Endpoint Technologies

2888
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,328
Which I don't know if they could have developed

2889
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:54,400
Maybe they could have

2890
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:56,448
Also possibly maybe they weren't

2891
02:28:57,984 --> 02:28:58,752
Do you know

2892
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:02,848
Baby baby. They developed all of the underlying technology

2893
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:04,384
Housing

2894
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,152
Yours back

2895
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:05,920
So

2896
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:06,688
No

2897
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,760
It's basically just

2898
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:10,784
These

2899
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,624
People who grandfather's at 8

2900
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:16,672
Long discovered

2901
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:17,696
Leeks

2902
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:20,000
Principles that were invented by the

2903
02:29:21,024 --> 02:29:21,536
Thousand

2904
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,304
Sears ago

2905
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:25,120
Medicine is the worst thing for Alex to give Europe

2906
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:28,704
I'm guessing he's just talking about like

2907
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:31,008
Deciding that Hippocrates was white

2908
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:32,544
And I'm assuming that it goes back to

2909
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:38,944
That's what it was

2910
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:44,064
Penicillin

2911
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:48,416
In reality that was Jonas

2912
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:51,488
Yeah in reality that was him looking at

2913
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,792
So many you

2914
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:59,680
Middle East

2915
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:07,104
Like I think that I was just

2916
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:08,896
Knows about the Hippocratic Oath

2917
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:14,272
Start

2918
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:19,136
Herbal medicine dates back to like well into the 2,000

2919
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:19,904
BCE

2920
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:20,928
Egyptians

2921
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,232
Clearly had Physicians working in the Palaces

2922
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,536
Hammurabi's Code which states

2923
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:26,560
1800 BC

2924
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,352
Prices

2925
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:31,936
Charge it even explicitly discusses the idea of

2926
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:36,288
Put the surgeons can charge

2927
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,312
Sure

2928
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:38,080
Yeah

2929
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:40,640
Many many papyrus

2930
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:42,944
From Egypt from 3000

2931
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:48,064
Is a 800 zaidi person scientist

2932
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,088
Allie Evans

2933
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,904
Robin altomari

2934
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,696
I wrote the world's great names

2935
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:56,256
World's first Encyclopedia of metal

2936
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,304
Am 1020

2937
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:01,120
Amara Ben Ali all of my swamp

2938
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,424
Performed the world's first successful ice

2939
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:05,728
We could go on and on listen

2940
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:09,312
Stanley non-white non-western influences in the development of Medicine

2941
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:11,104
But it would take all day

2942
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:14,176
We've arrived here where we are today

2943
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:17,504
The entire world has been apart of

2944
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:20,832
Enter selectively erase non-white history

2945
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,112
Definition

2946
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:23,136
A product of whites

2947
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:23,904
Supremacist

2948
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:28,256
The larger Point here is that white people or the West

2949
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:30,816
Has been responsible for a ton of great Innovations

2950
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:32,352
Inventions over the

2951
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:33,120
History

2952
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,472
Thank them

2953
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:38,240
For it

2954
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:43,104
This is a profoundly f*****-up way to look at the world as if Alex somehow deserve credit

2955
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,896
For someone who shares his skin pigment

2956
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:51,040
I'd like to propose a healthier way to look at things

2957
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:52,576
And that is to honor

2958
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:53,600
And celebrate

2959
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:55,136
All cultures

2960
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:58,720
Across the world who has helped lead us to where we are today

2961
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,536
Inner Mastery over

2962
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,304
Light

2963
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:05,632
Because I think that's a better way to look at things

2964
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:06,912
We've all shared in

2965
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:07,680
This history

2966
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:09,216
Some of the things that the Islam

2967
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:10,240
Sonic World

2968
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:11,776
Help

2969
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:12,800
Create

2970
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,848
Stones upon which

2971
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,384
The Western world

2972
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,944
Could use as staircases

2973
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:24,064
And if we all know if it weren't for anything we wouldn't have control over the

2974
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:30,208
I'm guessing it's a Dragon Ball Z reference

2975
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:37,632
Collaborative effort

2976
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:39,424
There's a collaborative effort

2977
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,192
It goes on

2978
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:43,008
Any history

2979
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:44,544
Aldi's

2980
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,824
Trucking Brown

2981
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,872
Sanko all of us white people for

2982
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:48,896
Airplanes in Madison

2983
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:50,944
It's just it's disrespectful

2984
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:53,504
Instrumental

2985
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:56,320
Meeting the reality that we have now

2986
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:58,368
Like if you just want to pretend

2987
02:32:59,648 --> 02:33:00,416
Created the jet

2988
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:01,696
Did it

2989
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:02,976
Out of nowhere

2990
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:06,304
So what you're doing is erasing everything that came before it

2991
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:08,608
You're erasing the

2992
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:11,424
Of largely Dawn White

2993
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:16,032
Plain and simple

2994
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:17,568
There's no way around

2995
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,896
Absolutely

2996
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:22,176
History

2997
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,456
Dear of invention

2998
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,480
Is

2999
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,504
So

3000
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,784
Furiate Angley

3001
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:29,088
Associated with

3002
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:29,856
Person

3003
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:33,952
It took

3004
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:40,352
Thousands of years and thousands of people working on it

3005
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:45,216
When the Library of Alexandria

3006
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,008
It's like

3007
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:47,776
Florida

3008
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:54,688
Knowledge of the world just destroyed

3009
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,480
Like we have

3010
02:33:56,736 --> 02:33:57,248
DIA

3011
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:59,808
How much was invented prior

3012
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:04,416
Destructive acts by white people

3013
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:08,000
You know how how many times can you think of something where is like

3014
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:14,400
Destroy the history of the world and then they were like yeah but we invented

3015
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,448
That

3016
02:34:16,704 --> 02:34:17,472
Isn't to say that wifey

3017
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:18,240
People are in

3018
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,312
Impulse

3019
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:23,872
People exist

3020
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:26,688
Like it wasn't White

3021
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:31,040
People who looted these Museum in Iraq

3022
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:35,392
13 husband

3023
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:42,048
Other cultures

3024
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:44,608
Other non-white cultures have also done that to other

3025
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,424
Like Warring States

3026
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:50,752
And stuff like that.

3027
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:52,800
That's that's what if

3028
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:58,176
Adorable

3029
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:03,296
Destroyed every chance

3030
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:04,320
Profoundly reducto

3031
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:05,600
Look at the world

3032
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:06,368
In such a way as

3033
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:08,160
This person invented

3034
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:09,184
I agree with that

3035
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,720
Because there are so few

3036
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,488
2 inventions

3037
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,280
In the world or even

3038
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:14,816
Breakthrough

3039
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:15,584
Renovation

3040
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:19,424
Attributable to a single poop

3041
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,472
It's always

3042
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:23,264
On the shoulders of giants

3043
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,288
But others

3044
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,336
Even like

3045
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:28,384
When you talk about like the Library of Alexandria

3046
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,664
We could have lost their

3047
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:34,272
Put your mind into a place is like

3048
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:36,064
What Festus

3049
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,904
What I'm more interested in on some level

3050
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,976
The Erasure of

3051
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:44,256
Failures

3052
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:46,048
Because a lot of things

3053
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:48,608
Contributed to

3054
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,632
Like our ability to

3055
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:51,168
The fly or ability

3056
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,472
Have a coherent Medical

3057
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,008
Even electricity

3058
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:57,312
Is people doing failed experiment

3059
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:58,848
That lad

3060
02:35:59,104 --> 02:35:59,616
People

3061
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:06,016
Away from the Snapchat or whatever part of

3062
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:09,856
That's where we are

3063
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:14,208
Even to most of legitimate history also set

3064
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:21,632
Often forgotten like

3065
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:26,752
Like he had pictures of people that he thought were in Africa

3066
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:30,080
Didn't have heads but instead had faces on their f******

3067
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:34,176
Orso's

3068
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,200
Bulshit

3069
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:37,504
Inspired by

3070
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:38,784
Fanciful ideas

3071
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,600
Reality that

3072
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,160
The real world

3073
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:47,488
I hear stuff

3074
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,304
It really bums me

3075
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:53,888
Because

3076
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:54,656
Because it's also

3077
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:56,192
Completely unintentional

3078
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:58,240
Which is the way Z episodes

3079
02:36:58,496 --> 02:36:59,008
Is this

3080
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,544
Beginning of the episode

3081
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,336
He's erasing the history

3082
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,104
Of

3083
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,640
Female politicians

3084
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
In the

3085
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,432
Arab and Islamic

3086
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,480
Expensive

3087
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,248
Disgusting

3088
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,296
Because it's presented world

3089
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,064
Beware

3090
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,856
Muslims are all Savages

3091
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Mets

3092
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:17,696
That's disgraceful

3093
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:21,536
Wheatley islamophobic and it's

3094
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:23,072
Counterproductive towards

3095
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,680
And then we come to the end of the episode Mustang

3096
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,472
Thanks for these things

3097
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,264
They brought the world

3098
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,800
Are you look at the actual history

3099
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:33,824
Call Vinson

3100
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,360
When you deal with it on a more realistic

3101
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:38,432
He's erasing all

3102
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:42,784
These other cultures that he doesn't

3103
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:49,184
Muslim world

3104
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,720
Inventing the concept of

3105
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:52,256
0

3106
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:54,304
You right there's no

3107
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:57,632
I know it

3108
02:37:57,888 --> 02:38:01,472
Then you have to thank everybody for s***

3109
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:03,776
You're always going to go back to

3110
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:07,872
Event where do you do that if you do that

3111
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:09,664
All you do is think the Chinese

3112
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:13,760
Irish descent

3113
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:15,296
The Chinese invent

3114
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,576
Whiskey sour

3115
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:20,928
Cultures that work

3116
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:22,976
There are still around

3117
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:25,792
Innovative

3118
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:28,096
Really basic

3119
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:30,400
You come down to like

3120
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,680
India and China

3121
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,472
So

3122
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:35,776
Pivotal

3123
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,824
Absolutely especially like mesoamerica

3124
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,712
Plumbing

3125
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:51,904
They're places in 300 in Central America that I would rather live in

3126
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:54,976
Then 1584 run

3127
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:58,048
You know for life

3128
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:02,912
If you play that game where you're going to end up with is something that Alex doesn't

3129
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:04,960
Which is that

3130
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:05,728
It isn't

3131
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:06,752
Western

3132
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:07,776
White cultures

3133
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,056
Created

3134
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:10,592
The building blocks

3135
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:12,384
The innovation

3136
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,408
That the Western Way

3137
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:14,432
He's dead

3138
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:15,456
And I only

3139
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,736
Understanding

3140
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:19,296
Help us all

3141
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,064
Understand

3142
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,368
Doesn't demonize white

3143
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:23,904
People it doesn't take any

3144
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,208
Anything away from the Innovations Western

3145
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:27,232
Culture

3146
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:29,792
Only build more robust on

3147
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,328
Understanding of how we're all in this

3148
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:32,608
You're right

3149
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:33,632
Inform

3150
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:34,656
This person's idea

3151
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,960
Your idea helps

3152
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:38,752
You come up with a better idea later

3153
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:46,176
All of us wouldn't even f****** exist

3154
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:48,736
If all of this other s*** hadn't happened

3155
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:55,392
You're probably right on that

3156
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:56,928
Mathematics

3157
02:39:57,184 --> 02:40:00,768
Created by white part of my IQ test

3158
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,864
Play f*** you what are you talking about

3159
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:08,704
Alex talks

3160
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:09,728
Leo zagami

3161
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:11,264
For a bunch

3162
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:14,848
Alex

3163
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:15,616
He threw up

3164
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:18,688
F****** liar with an accent

3165
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:19,712
Nut

3166
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:25,600
I'll listen to work

3167
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,488
I think I

3168
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,256
Can

3169
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:33,280
I've met

3170
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,072
Yaks

3171
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:43,776
Find myself

3172
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:54,016
Noni

3173
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:57,600
So he talks about the

3174
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:59,392
S*** that's going on in the

3175
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:00,160
The Vatican

3176
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:07,840
I honestly turned it off killing everybody it off like five

3177
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:13,728
Whatever they're going to come up with

3178
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:15,264
Like whatever

3179
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:18,592
Let's imagine the most Sensational lie Alex

3180
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,360
Can come up with

3181
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:21,408
About the pope and the Vatican

3182
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:25,504
With Leo zagami

3183
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
Maybe

3184
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:28,064
And also I don't give a s***

3185
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,344
You know like I don't

3186
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:30,624
I'm not going to

3187
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,160
We're already almost

3188
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:32,928
3 hours and

3189
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
Episode

3190
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:34,464
I was like

3191
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:38,560
It can only be a rehashing

3192
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,864
Two of them have already said

3193
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:43,936
Whatever

3194
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:47,776
I don't I don't Point could point but Alex does

3195
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:50,080
Which is the last quote

3196
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
About how

3197
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,688
Is that four out of five

3198
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:56,992
Sergei

3199
02:41:58,528 --> 02:41:59,552
Now paint

3200
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:04,416
Is that result from the latest Rascal Rasmussen poll

3201
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:07,232
Because

3202
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:09,024
Because Etienne

3203
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,048
The cliff

3204
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,072
Stores

3205
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,096
Oh no

3206
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:17,984
Anytime you get a very

3207
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:18,752
Very

3208
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:19,520
Intense look

3209
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:21,312
But I didn't work

3210
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:26,176
Pay close attention

3211
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:27,968
Because

3212
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:29,504
This is what is

3213
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:30,528
It is

3214
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:32,064
5 Seconds

3215
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:33,344
Alex

3216
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,208
Tells on himself

3217
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:41,024
He just point the finger at him

3218
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,584
He thinks he's being

3219
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,144
Magnanimous and super accepting

3220
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:46,912
Everybody

3221
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:47,936
It's so f*****

3222
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:55,104
Catholic priests are gay

3223
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:57,152
Homosexuals make coffee

3224
02:42:58,432 --> 02:43:01,760
The population

3225
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:03,808
I don't judge anybody

3226
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:10,464
45 years

3227
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:16,864
You are

3228
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,448
My children

3229
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:26,848
You know two dudes together like A3

3230
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:33,760
The realisation of what's right and what's wrong is it

3231
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:51,168
Literally the definition of the word he's literally saying that you do together is a 3

3232
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:55,008
On the immoral scale between which is

3233
02:43:55,264 --> 02:44:01,408
Incredibly f*****-up

3234
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:03,456
I have aborted my children

3235
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:07,552
When I was a teenager

3236
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:08,832
Which

3237
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:10,368
Like legit

3238
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:11,392
Straight up

3239
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:13,696
Murdered

3240
02:44:14,208 --> 02:44:16,768
Humanizes women

3241
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:23,424
By the way which subjects him to all of the punishments that he

3242
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:25,984
Subjects others

3243
02:44:26,496 --> 02:44:27,520
Subjected to 27

3244
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:30,848
So he should be if he wants to pull that s***

3245
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:36,224
Then fine go for good let's do it let's do it all across the board

3246
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:39,040
You are doing 20 years hard time now

3247
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:44,416
That's the rule if you're going to pull your.

3248
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:45,952
You think those people should be

3249
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:46,976
God

3250
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:49,024
Forgave him it's all good

3251
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:50,816
It's all good

3252
02:44:52,608 --> 02:44:54,656
You are saying other p

3253
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,496
Statute of limitations

3254
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:04,640
Look dude that's so crazy to me

3255
02:45:04,896 --> 02:45:05,920
Because it's like that this like

3256
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:07,456
It's A7

3257
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:14,112
Yeah which to me is Steve for his conception of abortion should be

3258
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,392
Sometimes it seems like

3259
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:16,160
To be at least

3260
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:16,928
9

3261
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:17,952
Like maybe

3262
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:21,280
It's got to be something to do

3263
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:22,048
Do the devil

3264
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:23,328
Precincts bedevils involved

3265
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:25,632
Right

3266
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:28,960
It's so great if

3267
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:31,776
Which he thinks is murder

3268
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:32,800
Is a 7

3269
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,432
Then

3270
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,456
To save it

3271
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:41,504
Together

3272
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:44,064
Which by the way is also

3273
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:46,368
Inconsiderate

3274
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:52,768
Custody is about the idea of men on men

3275
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:53,792
You still there

3276
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:57,632
So I also want to apologize I cut that clip a little bit too early

3277
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:59,680
Immediately after this Alex starts

3278
02:45:59,936 --> 02:46:00,448
Reading London

3279
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:01,472
Times article

3280
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:03,775
The article's headline says

3281
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:05,055
Infor

3282
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:08,127
Or one in five

3283
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:14,527
Yeah.

3284
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:17,087
Evan never acknowledges that

3285
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:17,855
He said

3286
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:21,695
The exact opposite music

3287
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:25,535
Intro to the same text Leo zagami it's a bunch of bulshit

3288
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:27,839
Episode

3289
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:29,375
I don't know

3290
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:31,167
I find this

3291
02:46:31,423 --> 02:46:32,191
Hard to do

3292
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:35,007
Necessary

3293
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:36,031
I'm in this real

3294
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:37,567
Place without

3295
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:38,591
Alex Jones in Fresno

3296
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:39,615
Because

3297
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:43,455
In terms of like I think he probably should be

3298
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:44,479
Thrown off the air

3299
02:46:44,991 --> 02:46:46,783
Which is the exact opposite position

3300
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:49,599
First episode of this podcast

3301
02:46:49,855 --> 02:46:51,135
I'm there

3302
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:56,255
Yeah because I do think that what we saw on the 11th on Mondays episode

3303
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:57,023
Thought

3304
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:57,791
That we covered

3305
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:01,631
Language

3306
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:03,423
View that is

3307
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:08,031
Recently given permission to his spot

3308
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:09,567
Yeah which is

3309
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:11,871
Kill people

3310
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:14,943
You'll know it when you see it

3311
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:15,967
Better things

3312
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:20,831
Looks like the Supreme Court form definition

3313
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:22,367
I know

3314
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,135
That's worth

3315
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,671
That's not okay

3316
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:26,207
When people are acting Wednesday

3317
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:26,975
The Time to Kill

3318
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:29,023
It's also. Okay if you're the Supreme Court

3319
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,839
No

3320
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:34,399
The question from a caller is Wednesday

3321
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:41,055
The question from a caller who has a military background

3322
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,103
That he is in other people's houses

3323
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:49,247
Clear what is Art Basel

3324
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:55,903
Do what he wants to do calling and asking Daddy give me the high side exactly give me the sign-in

3325
02:47:56,159 --> 02:48:02,303
Let's go give me a green light

3326
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:03,327
Someone asks you that

3327
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,607
Even if you're out

3328
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
Has to be

3329
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,727
Not you'll know it when you see it

3330
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:11,775
Something

3331
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:14,335
It has to be something like

3332
02:48:14,847 --> 02:48:16,639
Don't shoot till you see the whites in your eyes

3333
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:30,463
Weird Revolutionary War

3334
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:36,863
It's a reference today

3335
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:41,215
Because they're so close to you that you can't help do it

3336
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:43,263
I hate

3337
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:46,591
And I honestly think there's no reason this has allowed to

3338
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:47,615
Keep going

3339
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:51,455
Like I don't I do think that we're at a point where we're past the

3340
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:53,247
The point where this

3341
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,015
Like I don't

3342
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:55,807
Don't know the laws

3343
02:48:57,343 --> 02:48:58,623
Exactly where free speech

3344
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,439
I really do

3345
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:02,463
I feel spirit

3346
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:07,071
Past this point

3347
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:09,375
Because there's this trivial nonsense like

3348
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:12,703
He's reporting on this Soros

3349
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:15,519
When did

3350
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:18,079
I don't know what to do

3351
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:20,639
That

3352
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:21,919
Very difficult

3353
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,943
For me because

3354
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:25,503
Like we have this now Trump

3355
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:26,271
It's going to take

3356
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:27,295
State of emergency

3357
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:28,319
Create

3358
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:30,879
I knew Whirlwind of b*******

3359
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,415
And what have you

3360
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,695
At the same time

3361
02:49:34,207 --> 02:49:35,487
In the

3362
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:37,023
Sandy Hook lawsuit

3363
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:38,559
Alex

3364
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:40,351
It just came out today

3365
02:49:40,607 --> 02:49:41,119
The

3366
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:42,911
Judge has decided

3367
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:44,191
But Alex will have

3368
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:47,775
To be deposed for 5 hours session

3369
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:49,055
With the lawyers

3370
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:50,335
And that's going to be

3371
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:51,359
Sweet disaster

3372
02:49:52,127 --> 02:49:52,895
So I honestly

3373
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:54,687
In ways that

3374
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:56,479
You have not been subject

3375
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:58,527
When he's

3376
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,295
Define people

3377
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:03,391
Is

3378
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:04,671
Cruisin for a Bruisin

3379
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:06,719
Like Huey's Auto

3380
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:07,487
Towards

3381
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:08,511
This could

3382
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:09,535
Actually hurt

3383
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:11,839
Yeah so there's some part of me that

3384
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:12,607
Think we have

3385
02:50:12,863 --> 02:50:13,631
Responsibility

3386
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:16,191
Now cover this as it

3387
02:50:17,215 --> 02:50:17,983
Because there is a

3388
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:20,799
AAA massive down

3389
02:50:21,055 --> 02:50:21,823
Spiral

3390
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:23,615
Wright Realty

3391
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:25,919
I feel that pressure

3392
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:29,247
It suck

3393
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:31,551
Because also at the same time

3394
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:32,575
Absent

3395
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:33,599
Pressure

3396
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:35,647
I think he's behaving in

3397
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:37,439
That it should

3398
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:38,463
This show shouldn't

3399
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,487
Exist

3400
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:45,119
The question is not that everybody

3401
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:46,655
Doesn't agree with

3402
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:47,935
Do you know what I mean like

3403
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:49,471
Everybody agrees

3404
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:51,519
Broadleaf probably

3405
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:53,567
That Alex's show

3406
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:54,591
As it is now

3407
02:50:54,847 --> 02:50:55,359
You should not exist

3408
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:57,407
The problem with taking

3409
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:58,175
To a quart

3410
02:50:59,199 --> 02:50:59,711
Is

3411
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:02,015
You don't know how the cord is

3412
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:02,783
Going to rule

3413
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:04,319
So it makes

3414
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:06,623
More sense to not rule on this

3415
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:09,183
And then have the threat of a

3416
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:11,487
Court action be available

3417
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:14,303
Then have a Court rule on this against you

3418
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:16,351
Because if the court

3419
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:18,655
Listen to If the Supreme Court

3420
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:20,959
Listens to this whole thing

3421
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:23,263
And says actually this is protected

3422
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:24,031
Speech

3423
02:51:24,543 --> 02:51:26,847
Then we don't know where the line

3424
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:28,895
We don't know where the one

3425
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:32,479
Because it's like this one world

3426
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:39,903
I would rather live in a world where a broad spectrum of people

3427
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:41,951
Greed set this is bad

3428
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:46,047
Don't take it to the courts and we kind of handle this ourselves

3429
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:50,143
Where is I don't want to live in a world where

3430
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:52,191
We take it to the courts

3431
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:53,983
They say that this is fine

3432
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:58,591
And then we're in Uncharted Territory as to what isn't

3433
02:51:58,847 --> 02:52:00,383
Or the flip side

3434
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:02,175
Courts and then a precedent

3435
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:06,015
Crouching

3436
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:07,039
Yeah

3437
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:12,415
Ambiguous

3438
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:15,231
Becomes suspect right just because Alex

3439
02:52:15,487 --> 02:52:16,767
Legitimately

3440
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:26,239
As the first I'd rather err on the side of allowing Alex

3441
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:30,591
And also talked about it everyone understand the danger of it

3442
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:32,127
Then legislate

3443
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:34,431
This is this should not happen

3444
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:35,711
It's

3445
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:38,271
It's a strange Place wherein it's important

3446
02:52:38,527 --> 02:52:40,319
To have the concept of free speech

3447
02:52:41,087 --> 02:52:42,367
Bu enshrine

3448
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:46,463
Walk the same time have the ambiguity of what it is

3449
02:52:47,999 --> 02:52:48,767
As a

3450
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:50,047
Fundamental concept

3451
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:51,071
Do you know what I mean

3452
02:52:51,327 --> 02:52:52,863
Anyway

3453
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:04,383
You see like

3454
02:53:07,199 --> 02:53:08,479
Anti-racism yet

3455
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:14,367
Rogan's Shoes

3456
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:15,647
Anyone else

3457
02:53:17,695 --> 02:53:18,207
You can't

3458
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:19,743
Nope you decided to

3459
02:53:20,767 --> 02:53:21,279
Fabulous

3460
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:24,351

Super interested in finding

3463
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:38,175
What do its knowledge

3464
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:48,159
We did not end

3465
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:54,047
Brenton Joe and absolutely

3466
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:00,959

I would say that

3470
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:23,231
So throw you some for b****

3471
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:26,559
But we would do any podcast for any interviews it

3472
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:31,935
Crypto.com

3473
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:32,703
If you guys want us to

3474
02:54:33,215 --> 02:54:34,495
Scheduling both

3475
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,263
Give us together is

3476
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:38,847
Is difficult but not impossible but not about we can do it

3477
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:39,615
If you would like us to

3478
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:41,151
I have a little conversation

3479
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:42,687
We are more than willing

3480
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:44,991
We appreciate everyone who is that

3481
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:49,599
You want to have a conversation though the best place to have a conversation with both of us

3482
02:54:54,719 --> 02:55:00,863
Fun times over there

3483
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:01,631
Overcast

3484
02:55:03,423 --> 02:55:04,191
I know

3485
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:15,711
I Apple showing everything so yeah

3486
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:18,527
We're on that we just don't even know about absolutely no one

3487
02:55:18,783 --> 02:55:19,551
No one is asked

3488
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:24,671
I would say

3489
02:55:28,255 --> 02:55:29,279
Who are the cast of Paris

3490
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:35,679
Spin Alex being a racist representative Omar

3491
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:41,823
You killed anybody

3492
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:42,591
Great person

3493
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:45,919
One who is responsible for

3494
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:52,063
Tons of murders are really responsible for

3495
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:53,599
Lotto

3496
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:55,903
But she hasn't

3497
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:59,231
Probably

3498
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:00,255
Is Alex Jones

3499
02:56:01,023 --> 02:56:03,071
Holding

3500
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:08,703
Alex
