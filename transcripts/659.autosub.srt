1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Goddamn

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody look like now try the best

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
And for you sir

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Wow oh my God

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Think is that I think I've done with Wordle

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,648
I was a late adopter yeah I saw people posting these a green dots of s***

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
And I was like I don't want to get

11
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,792
Get involved I see these things come and go and I just like

12
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,376
I'm too old for this at this nonsense but I do like word games

13
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
I like

14
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
You know

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Arab Scrabble guy

16
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
I have been in the back

17
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
I like to kick my ass

18
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,920
Every time we played Scrabble

19
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Boggle lovebug

20
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Equally

21
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
Ill-fitting names that I enjoy

22
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
25 day streak

23
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
And it's

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Not even

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Fun

26
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,144
You got it right board

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
I don't want to

28
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,520
Do you like bragging or anything I'm like Alex here

29
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,128
No big deal but you got the right 2500 very easy thing

30
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
Yeah very easy game not be all that much to it

31
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
I mean I'm

32
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
Pretty sure that is the specific charm to the game might be

33
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,976
Not for you it might be the a b b y n is universal appeal it's the bar of Entry is

34
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Challenging enough

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
So pick it up

36
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
They are tied together

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,704
How many times do we have to say this to you do your time

38
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Wasn't

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Getting them right I'd be mad

40
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
So the flip side

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
I think you need to be getting it right

42
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
At around like 85% of the time

43
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
You both have the satisfaction of achievement

44
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,392
While at the same time something to like shoot for

45
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
25 days out of 25 days in a row you're just like I can

46
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
I'm the master of

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,352
I'm not I'm not going that far but I didn't

48
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
It's the opposite of Elden ring

49
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Whatever you think about this way

50
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
If you got one wrong tomorrow

51
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,360
Then the next day you'd be so ready and raring to go baby

52
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
I might not

53
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
That's true I might be in the exact same place I am that which is I'm not

54
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Brightspot

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Is

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,928
I have as you know we talked about it I got contacts

57
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Right

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
But

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,864
I hadn't even noticed cuz you also shaved your beard around the same time

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Multiple switches at the same time

61
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Of my face

62
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
But

63
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
The eye doctor

64
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Whenever I got the contacts

65
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
We put in the regular ones

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Is everything is going great

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
And then right as I'm about to leave

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
He just puts Toulouse

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
Contacts in my hand not loose like they were out

70
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Little yeah to Lucy's

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
And he kind of gets in real clothes like he's

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
He's doing a drug deal and it was like you know these are transition contact lens

73
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
And I was like I do not understand what you're talking to

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
In the light they change to a darker color

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
Very sensitive ice I do like the idea of the doctor tried to be like a

76
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,711
Coronavirus

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Check these out you don't even know me

78
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,879
I don't know things like strep throat in college one time

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,231
Swallow pills and Health Center to get to

80
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Steroids

81
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Right to alleviate things

82
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Because I couldn't take pills I needed to get the liquid

83
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Steroids

84
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,215
And the doctor when he was given

85
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Sarasota like

86
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Conspiratorial

87
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
The stuff the Retro 7 about

88
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,623
But for me it was about getting messed up on purple drank

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Though I was actually sick

90
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Anyway

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
We do excellent number of episodes

92
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,471
Alex and a little bit of time

93
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
So just some awful Basin and such

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
But

95
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
I'm not going to chase him around

96
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,967
Back to the past again

97
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
3 because there was a story that we had left hanging sort of

98
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
In 2003 which was the situation with

99
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
The

100
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
The weapons expert in Iraq who had died

101
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Suicide

102
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
And I felt like if we left that hanging

103
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
We might

104
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,983
Forget that that was something that we had to like the back of it

105
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
So we're going to take care of some of that talks about it

106
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
Painfully boring stretch of Alex's show

107
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
That leads to something quite fun

108
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
Let's

109
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,255
Tabby

110
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
I'm a policy wonk hold me closer Tabby Prancer

111
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Thank you so much

112
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,079
Thank you very much Charles Schwab thank you so much

113
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
It's hard to tell

114
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
Ricky's mom has got it goin on

115
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
Thank you very much next Unity paint stuff punk-rock King of the cats thank you so much

116
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,399
Thank you very much. You know what I am mad at the cruise

117
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
Thank you very much

118
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,591
July 21st through 23rd 2003

119
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
I kind of had just intended to you notice

120
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Just do one episode

121
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Fast

122
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
But then

123
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
No man's land

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Oh this is a

125
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
Long a desert of content

126
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Alex is going to eat

127
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Weird weird

128
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Stretches

129
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
Saying nothing for long periods of time

130
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
On the show

131
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Which is why we need to

132
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,519
Go three days back about literally catching up with

133
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Yeah and so

134
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
We do get to on this July 21st episode

135
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Alex brings back up the weapons

136
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Inspector from the UK David Kelly

137
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
Clean the Slate on this one

138
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
I'm going to

139
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
I'm going to get my

140
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
And I was

141
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Walked

142
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
A big Walker

143
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
We cannot read his email

144
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
For there

145
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
So I decided not to cover this on our last 2003 episode because I knew was a story that was going to come back up and then Alex

146
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Who's going to develop

147
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,423
Conspiracy around so I wanted to wait until you have a chance to do that before getting into

148
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Any rebuttal

149
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
Also the piece that we discussed on the last episode is just details

150
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Aftermath of Kelly's death

151
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
In order to prevent the idea that he was murdered

152
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Now more information has become Publix Alex

153
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Claiming victory in his prediction that this was a murder that's being covered

154
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
So now let's try and understand this case a little better in its proper

155
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
This Story begins with David Kelly

156
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,375
A well-respected expert in biological weapons speaking to a couple of journalists under the assumption of anonymity

157
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,215
These were Andrew Gilligan of the BBC and Susan White

158
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Reported for Newsnight

159
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
What are the strike

160
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Details that was

161
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,383
Included in both of their reports was that

162
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
Had intentionally misled the public by injecting the claim into a dossier about a Reiki weapons of mass destruction

163
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Capability

164
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Namely that the Iraq

165
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,415
The government could activate their weapons within 45 minutes

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,279
This was a salacious detail a very detailed

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,863
It was in both watts and Gilligan's reporting

168
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
From an unnamed source

169
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
It was something

170
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
That previously today is even Tony Blair

171
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah in the rationale for going to war

172
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Dying

173
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
Fake source that they use to just lie there at headed their teeth off of this isn't he

174
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,487
I know that's not David Kelly but they had the special about

175
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
8

176
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
The guy from Top Gun

177
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
I was thinking of mister

178
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
David kellywood

179
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
So Gilligan's reporting specifically alleged that this claim was put in as an attempt by the government to me

180
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Mislead

181
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,735
His initial appearance reporting on this on the May 29th 2003 episode of

182
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Today Gilligan side quote

183
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
What does person says

184
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,207
Is that a week before the publication date of dossier it was actually rather a bland production

185
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,839
It didn't leave the draft presented prepared for mr. Blair by the intelligence agencies

186
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
Didn't actually say very much more than was public knowledge already

187
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,823
Our source says ordered a week before publication

188
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,175
To be made more exciting and ordered more facts to be to be discovered

189
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,575
Gilligan stressed that this detail the 45-minute point was very Central to Tony Blair's appeal to go to war

190
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,439
Scented stress the immediacy of the Potential Threat and it is reporting he was strongly suggesting

191
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
That based on this unknown source

192
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,815
This was something that the new shouldn't have been included in the dossier

193
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
This was primarily because it was something that only came from One Source initially who this apparent

194
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Atlee this intelligence Source claimed

195
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Was thought

196
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
To have been mistaken

197
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
The person who was

198
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,223
Did the person do one sources behind the 45-minute client was known to be probably wrong

199
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
Yes why what are a liar

200
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
Or just like a fabulous or something

201
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,207
After this May 30th Susan W contacted Kelly and interviewed him over the phone

202
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Witchy record

203
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,607
The transcript of this call makes it very clear that Kelly was aware that he was the source of these clients

204
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,983
Emmett from particular details and Gilligan's reporting as well as that of another BBC reporter Kelly it's Boca

205
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Continue

206
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
It was clear that W could tell that he was

207
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
Their Source based on previous conversations that they had had

208
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Right so pretty immediately the ministry of Science of Downing Street came out and strongly denied the claims are being made in the media

209
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
And the House of Commons set up a committee to investigate whether or not the

210
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
The decision to go to war even done with complete

211
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
And accurate information

212
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Hahaha

213
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
One of the MPS who launched the effort Donald Anderson

214
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,679
I'm specifically cited Gilligan's reporting as one of the factors that led to the decision to open that inquiry

215
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,311
At the same time the ministry of Defence was curious about who leaked this information but they

216
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Assault was

217
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Accurate

218
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,175
On July 30th Kelly wrote a letter to his higher-ups

219
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
The ministry of Defence which

220
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Definitely intended

221
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
How to create the impression that he barely spoke

222
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
2 Gilligan

223
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
He didn't say the stuff that was being reported

224
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
How many didn't even consider that he could have been his Source until June

225
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
18th when someone informed them

226
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
But some of the evidence

227
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
Since provided in the House of Commons in Korea match details

228
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
He would have given

229
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
This is demonstrable be untrue the stuff that was he was saying in this ministry of Defense

230
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Gordon Kelly's conversation with

231
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
From May 30th

232
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,783
Hey discussing the reporting it was happening she asked are you getting much flak over that to which Kelly replied

233
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Club me

234
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
No not yet anyway I was in New York

235
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
What says quote yes good-timing I suppose and Kelly offers up quote I mean they wouldn't think it was me I don't think

236
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
I think maybe they would maybe they wouldn't

237
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
I don't know

238
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Wow

239
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Retrospect probably should have said that one

240
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,335
This letter prompted some internal conversations and interviews within the ministry of Defense

241
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Really we're not good

242
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
For Kelly

243
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
He was interviewed by his superiors on July 4th and on the 7th and note was prepared in respect to the interview

244
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Music starts quote

245
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
I began by explaining to dr. Kelly that is letterhead serious implications

246
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,815
First on the basis of his own account it appeared that he breached the normal standards of civil service Behavior

247
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,423
And departmental regulations by having a number of unauthorized and unreported contacts

248
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Journalist

249
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
Regardless of the detail of what passed

250
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
This opened up the possibility of disciplinary Acts

251
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
This is really bad

252
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,967
For Kelly because even if his story about not being the source for these claims was accurate

253
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,831
You still might be in trouble and the fact that he's admitting to undisclosed contact with journalist

254
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Necessarily meant that more questions were going to be asked

255
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
How about these

256
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Initial interview

257
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Go all that well with it coming out the kelly didn't even seem to be aware of the ministry of Defense protocol as it related to

258
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Interacting with journals

259
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
From the note about his interview

260
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,359
He said that he had not really regarded his discussions with journalists academics etcetera

261
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
Has being about defense business but as a continuation

262
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Ibiz roll

263
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
As a u n x

264
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
I said that this was at best extraordinary Li naive

265
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
Journalist or not seeking information out of academic interest

266
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
But to construct story

267
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
In that interview the stakes of the situation became pretty clear

268
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Which may not have

269
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Bet the case prior

270
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Richard Hatfield the Personnel director of the ministry

271
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Be the case or not

272
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
His conversation with Gilligan maybe Central to resolving

273
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
Any public dispute between the government and the BBC

274
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,295
Quote it might become necessary to consider a public statement based on his account

275
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,415
Gilligan's reputation was at stake and he would be bound to challenge any of accuracies

276
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
And I reminded dr. Kelly of the possibility that

277
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
He might have been tape-recorded

278
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,679
Ultimately Hatfield took Kelly's word and decided that his actions in terms of talking to journalists was very naive

279
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
But not rising to the level of requiring disciplinary action

280
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
Essentially got off with a warning

281
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Stewby's

282
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
These meetings that were about his letter that he sent to the ministry of Defense

283
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
About the pizza special

284
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
But questions lingered and is more details came out from the Foreign Affairs select committee inquiry that was going on there was

285
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Initiated by the House of Commons

286
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,279
It became more and more clear to people within the ministry of Defence that in all likelihood

287
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Kelly was going

288
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Open source

289
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,215
Gilligan was making things up in a way that attributed his coverage to a source who was meant to look

290
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
When is a.c. report was released they determined that there was no evidence that the claim that the 45-minute.

291
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Detail was

292
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Against the wishes of the intelligence community

293
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
As was the contention of Gilligan's reporting

294
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
Which relied on Kelly as a source

295
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,255
Because of that it became clear the people at the ministry of Defence that a bunch of questions are about to start flying around

296
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
About who the source for Gilligan story was

297
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
And that if it were asked

298
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
They would have to say that someone had come forward internally

299
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Or else they would be

300
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Engaging in a cover-up

301
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
They wouldn't have to come out name Kelly

302
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,407
There was a very high likelihood that his name would come out

303
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,991
Based on his contact with multiple journalists were probably going to be able to put the piece

304
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
But your host

305
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
That's where there's at

306
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,231
There is a possibility of something

307
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Going bad

308
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
On July 8th the ministry of Defence released a statement that someone inside the ministry had come forward to say that he had met with Gilligan

309
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
Though Kelly was not named in this statement

310
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,127
The statement reflected terms that Kelly had agreed to and that what he had said when he met Gilligan didn't match the

311
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
The accountant the reports

312
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
That was the base

313
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Like I said Kelly agreed to this meeting

314
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Early scores

315
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,367
Naturally dislike the BBC releasing the statement defending their reporting which led to an impasse

316
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Since both sides

317
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Really reveal who they were talking to

318
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Let's Travel

319
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah

320
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
On July 9th

321
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,607
Kelly's name was confirmed to the press as being the person who came forward as the result of a

322
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
The q-and-a session

323
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
With a representative from the ministry of time

324
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
A policy of not naming Kelly but if

325
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
The question was asked directly to them

326
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
They would be able to confirm that he was the official in question

327
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,343
And Kelly decided to not poop for a while taking his family to a coastal town

328
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
Kelly understandably felt hung out to dry by the ministry of Defence in a secure location

329
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Alex

330
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
Talks about like him feeling mistreated by

331
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
The government

332
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
This is a large part of

333
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,383
He wasn't given any heads up about like you're going to confirm that I'm the person

334
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
The ministry of Defence policy was essentially Will Ferrell in Austin Powers worth

335
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
Now I have to tell you it's mr. Kelly like what are you talkin about

336
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
If they ask a good question but you have to tell him the problems that to conceivably is there like you just listed

337
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
Turn off names eventually

338
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
It's not not at Ironclad way to keep information

339
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Here are my guesses

340
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
Snow isn't him

341
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
No is it him yes

342
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
So on July 15th Kelly appear before the Foreign Affairs committee and questions came up not only

343
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
About his conversation

344
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Gilligan but also Susan what

345
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,903
In his testimony Kelly claims that you'd only met with W one time and it was in November 2002

346
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
On this basis he denied making the claims that were alleged

347
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
And Susan watts is reporting

348
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
This will become a huge problem later because as I mentioned

349
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
W recorded their interview

350
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Ferrara

351
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:56,031
He's an interview viewed in the context of other known information seems very evasive

352
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Attract

353
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Probably met somebody acting malicious

354
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,015
It is the feeling of somebody who made a huge mistake and things have gotten way out of hand to the point where reputations

355
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
And wipes

356
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
To work we're in danger of being too

357
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,927
Destroy yeah cuz he was a very credible well-respected

358
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
Weapons expert who had a headache deep resume

359
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
I know it seems like there's a possibility he was just talkin s*** and it got out of hand

360
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
He just started talking and then kept trying to like

361
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,615
Do inconsistent do damage control only made things spiral further out of control

362
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
If it has some of that vibe

363
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
So Kelly left the fac hearing feeling good

364
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
The press that included this line

365
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,487
Quote colleagues have also asked me to pass on their view the doctor Kelly has been poorly treated by the government

366
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,839
Another place where Alex is taking this claim of mistreatment

367
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
The government towards Kelly

368
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
The next day July 16th Kelly was set to testify before the intelligence

369
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,335
And security committee which followed along a lot of the same lines

370
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
As the previous day's hearing

371
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
On the 17th Kelly provided a list

372
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
Journalists have been in touch with to the committee's

373
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Is Android a bunch of emails to associate

374
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Many had reached out with well wishes

375
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,672
Blow over soon

376
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Alex's mischaracterizing his emails

377
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
Has it been saying he's going to fight

378
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,216
Doing that because that's what fits the archetype narrative that Alex sells

379
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
About whistleblowers

380
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:36,640
That's Alex budget details make a particular case fit his mold as opposed to him recognizing details that are

381
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,248
Yo I seen them out in the wild nugget it's consistently reimold

382
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
Jamming it into the

383
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
According to Kelly's wife's testimony morning

384
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
They've got nothing

385
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
And he seemed normal but pretty tired

386
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,840
A little later in the day she found him sitting silently in the sitting room which is uncharacteristic of him

387
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
I thought he had a broken heart

388
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
He was very very

389
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
It shrunk it to himself

390
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
He just looked as he is he a trunk

391
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
He couldn't put

392
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Two sentences together they couldn't talk

393
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
20 that afternoon Kelly left the house for a walk Evan previously received a call from an associate of his wing

394
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Commander Clark

395
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
Who had discussed issues related to Susan Watts

396
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
It'd be rise in a full investigation of his dad that it's some point after the hearings he became aware that there was a recording of his interview

397
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,888
With w and that he had testified that he absolutely not said the things that were on that

398
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Bright

399
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Clark's mansion

400
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
But they had discussed W in their last phone call give some Credence to this those Clark's testimony regarding Kelly's

401
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Spots to the hearing on the 5th

402
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:46,272
Quote you was totally thrown by the question or the quotation that was given to him from Susan Watts

403
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
He spoke about that when he came back to the office

404
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
He said that through him

405
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,488
Yeah he did not expected or anticipated that that would have come to the fore in this forum

406
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,072
I'm not going to get into the details about it but there's a very compelling

407
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
Evidence that he died from suicide

408
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
The story are just figments of his second match today

409
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
This story is a tragedy and it all likelihood it's a story of someone who made a really big mistake and then in the process of dealing with

410
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Take me to series of further mistakes

411
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
Until he was facing the prospect of his reputation being destroyed

412
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,392
Is freedom possibly being taken away and even the possibility

413
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
Have him being seen as working against his country's government

414
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
David Kelly at the rudest things

415
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
Wasn't even a whistleblower the way Alex uses

416
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Is the term stories just disgraceful

417
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
With no evidence other than his imagination Alex's suggesting that Kelly was ambushed and murdered because if that were true

418
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
It would really help Alex

419
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Spell the kind of

420
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
Scary stories that he likes

421
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
To tell to keep his audience interested

422
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
He's exploiting tragedy and using Kelly's death is a prop

423
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Vines

424
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Inexcusable

425
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
And disgusting

426
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Zeinab

427
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
The story of

428
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
Kelly's

429
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,816
Fall is a tragic but very interesting

430
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Right

431
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Tail

432
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
It is it is very much like

433
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Cinematic and it's

434
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
So you know just that like

435
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Oh f***

436
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Ofac

437
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Keeps trying to get ahead of it

438
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
Keeps trying to be one step away from like

439
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
I got away and it just

440
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Caught up

441
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Just caught up

442
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:29,952
Man possibly or I think there's an entire possibility that he didn't think that he had said the things that were B

443
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Being used in the reporting

444
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,584
Until he realized there was a recording of stopping that it became

445
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
Became harshly real

446
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
I I don't really know and since he's

447
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Gone

448
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
You know I don't know if you'll ever really know

449
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
But I

450
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Yeah I don't know

451
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:52,736
That did not have to go this way

452
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,832
And I think Alex only makes it worse by trying to

453
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:02,208
Co-opted it for his own purposes you betcha there is one detail

454
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,536
That actually does lend itself to Alex's

455
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Theory

456
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Bring it up in this next clip

457
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
I am done

458
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm being harassed

459
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Dark

460
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Are all around me

461
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,208
Exaggerating that but there is an email the David Kelly sat that morning that mentioned

462
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Quote dark

463
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
There's an irony that Alex is missing here though because that email was sent to New York Times columnist and Iraq war All Star

464
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Judith Miller

465
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
On the 16th Miller Road Kelly saying I heard from another member of your fan club that things went well for you today

466
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Hope it's true

467
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
Kelly replied on the morning of the 17th quote

468
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
I will wait until the end of the week before judge

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Many dark actors playing game

470
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,184
It's certainly a weird thing to say but there's no context for this combat and none of his other correspondences

471
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
Nor his family members testimony match the conclusion

472
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Alex is jumping to

473
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
You could easily see it being some

474
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
Reference did between him and Judith like I don't know I don't know how people communicate right

475
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,800
The other emails that are

476
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
Is like the investigation

477
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Documents you can find

478
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
None of them

479
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,784
Have that tone at all but maybe image

480
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Weird terms

481
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Entirely possible

482
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
I mean I would imagine he that

483
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
Time with his point of view in the circle

484
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Stances

485
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
I imagine that he's

486
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Definitely got some like

487
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
People are out to get me

488
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
You know what actually one of his big fears

489
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,776
That you can find if you really look into the details was that the Iraqi

490
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
People would

491
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
To get them

492
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
That's because

493
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
He had been involved

494
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Boudin

495
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,248
Looking at weapons capabilities and also with

496
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,368
Some not necessarily the highest levels but some elements of negotiation

497
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
And salt discussions with

498
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
The Iraqi side right about like

499
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:16,608
Just give these things off mcgiver sure and says and then there won't be a war do nothing for happen

500
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
And he had some fear that he would

501
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
End up

502
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
Becoming a CNA somebody who's lying to them

503
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Attack them right yeah right

504
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Could not be higher

505
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Yeah

506
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
And

507
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
Brutal

508
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Just just horrific

509
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Alex gets a call

510
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
He is not going on

511
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
This caller wants to know like

512
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
What is

513
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
The military-industrial

514
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
What is this

515
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,472
Shadowy organization alright who's on top

516
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
It is

517
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,616
And Alex gives me the pecking order

518
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Industrial

519
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
WhatsApp

520
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
What

521
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
I understand that

522
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
Sound system really giving the pecking order of the military-industrial complex he's putting it into another flowchart which is the New World

523
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,064
Order which has the Rothchilds and the bankers and the crops

524
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
Sprite above them

525
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
A man above that is

526
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Queen Beatrix

527
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Barnard

528
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,632
If if somebody asked me hate Jordan what's the military-industrial complex my cream my first thought isn't like

529
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Well the Royal Family's own tabloid

530
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
That's not how you begin a response to that question

531
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
It's it's

532
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
So Beatrix royal family owns tabloid man

533
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
Set back they own tablet

534
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
And then they owned Banks and then the Rothschilds

535
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
And out of them comes to military industrial complex

536
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
But

537
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Again

538
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
That's just Lockheed Martin

539
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
Ncbc and then BC

540
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
NBC

541
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Prisoners own everything

542
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,592
Well no the Lockheed Martin of the military-industrial complex on the TV stations

543
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
They're owned by the bankers and

544
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
Who is that owned by the family

545
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,808
We know because of the present-day that the devil is about that

546
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Topmark Alex's

547
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
Either intentionally obscuring this fact the past true or it wasn't a piece of today's cosmology

548
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,816
I think you got the vision

549
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
From God yet who knows

550
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
You have been hit on the head enough times

551
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,008
Tony Blair bush

552
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
This life is meaningless and there'll be no reason to included in the show on its own but I wanted to play at Notre to bring up an important point

553
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,584
Because I think it's actually really detrimental to Alex's entire world

554
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
As he sees it the evil globalist are essentially in control of every

555
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,776
Which is how he's able to determine what their next moves are going to be

556
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:14,176
Bush and Blair are losing public support so they need to do something to regain control over the population it because Alex knows that they can

557
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Literally

558
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Anyting

559
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
The obvious solution is that they're going to do a false like

560
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,112
To get the population back into a state of fear where they could be controlled

561
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
The only thing that makes sense.

562
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
But that didn't

563
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,512
There wasn't a terrorist attack in George W Bush's approval ratings

564
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
Continued to slump all the way until the end of his presidency

565
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,168
If Alex is worldview was correct this should not have happened

566
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
It should not have been possible for this app

567
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:44,128
Bush should have had all the control over the mechanisms that manipulate public opinion and Alex knows that a false like carrots

568
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,480
Back is our favorite tool to win the people that world savior

569
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
It didn't happen

570
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,696
The reason is Cliffwood usually never make it into an episode is because Alex has s*** like this all the time to the point where

571
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
Even notice these predict

572
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
10:30 got wrong

573
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
What I'm listening to his show

574
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:07,168
These misfires that actually point to the conclusion without the worldview is meaningless

575
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Just blend into the background of the show

576
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
It's just

577
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,360
I mean it seems like at this point he would say if he knows what's going on

578
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,992
That's better going to allow George Bush's approval ratings to drop further and farther

579
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,296
So they can bring in a Democrat president

580
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
Maybe even

581
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
All black one

582
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
Well if he pulled that off man I'm on his team but he

583
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Alex isn't even

584
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
2004 election

585
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,936
I work quite a ways for 2008

586
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,008
Then we're talking about some serious prediction ability

587
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
But him being like

588
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
They'll figure it out he'll be given that much like sort of predictive credit for that cuz

589
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
It still could be rooted in some kind of bigotry

590
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
So could this be like it could just be like a race is Grandpa on a chair

591
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
That would win people over

592
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,888
Those bastards I could see that still not being like

593
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
Strong severe the future

594
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,544
Forklift from July 21st cuz honestly this show

595
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Stinks

596
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
A large percentage of it is Alex reading the entirety of a Ron Paul speech called

597
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Neocon

598
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,576
Where are you sad I talk about how bad the neocon talk

599
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
They do disagree

600
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,000
To Alex reading in 2003 cuz

601
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
It's a little bit

602
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
Well Lot B better than the Press

603
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,192
He's better at sight-reading a little

604
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
It said of the constant struggle

605
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
It's still awful

606
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
To listen to

607
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
It's not nearly as torturous

608
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
But use another dumb

609
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Bad prediction

610
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
Terrorist attacks that the government and the globalists are going to do and I didn't going to be

611
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
Be a draft in response to that which also didn't happen

612
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
I don't know I mean like

613
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
If I wanted to I could make this show just

614
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
A wallowing

615
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
In bad prediction Alex likes

616
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
But it just

617
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
If it serves our entertainment purposes

618
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
From just

619
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,648
Hitting that drum over and over and over and over again

620
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
So-so

621
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
Now we start the 22nd

622
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
And actually

623
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Holyshit

624
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
Me and Alex agree on something

625
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
The royal family does whenever

626
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
No

627
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Now

628
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Will

629
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Vietnamese

630
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
Alright here we go I know that some people probably don't believe me but I really do try to keep my ears open for insta

631
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
Anticipating that I think Alex gets right

632
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
And they really don't come up that often

633
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,000
It's easy to think that because our shows about how much he's a huge liar and a big hit that we wouldn't want to allow any perception

634
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
10 degree pin that he could be right about stuff

635
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
But the truth is they when it comes to concrete stories in position

636
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
He's almost always wrong

637
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
But here's something I can get down with

638
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,872
I do believe the torture is always wrong but testimony that's derived from torture can't be trusted and I'm glad that Alex is on the same

639
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Yep

640
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:06,528
Unfortunately I know if I'm listening to Alex into the future that he doesn't necessarily have this is consistent position to be always

641
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
62 totally fine to ruin the fun for the moment

642
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:18,304
2003 though we're on board

643
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,656
Thank you this was a story about it MI5 expert testifying that they wouldn't

644
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
Think that information derived from torture is

645
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Always not correct

646
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,080
And it's sometimes it could be useful which socks

647
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,944
Even if that statement is true it doesn't make the case for using that practice anymore compel

648
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,528
People's 9/11 time was a horrific.

649
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,392
Where people were openly discussing whether or not the benefits of torturing people made up for the inhumanity of it

650
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
And it's

651
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Not pleasure

652
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
That's early to go back in

653
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Just how awful things were those conversations that were happening in Buena presumably mainstream space

654
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,776
The Alex has such an easy stance to take to appear to be the same

655
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
It is hard to imagine

656
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Not

657
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
Reaching the bar of

658
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
Don't torture human beings

659
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
And it's like

660
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,528
It is amazing that the

661
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
Bush Administration

662
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
Was like okay we got to get the shadiest most evil lawyers we can find to write a torture memo that says it's

663
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Okay for us

664
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
To torture and then we haven't even hunted them down and put them in jail for the rest of their life you know like they're just allowed

665
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Continue

666
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,544
Walking the Earth like they're fine you know obviously were opposed

667
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
No

668
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:41,504
Some of the more mainstream figures that you might see like politician yet maybe wear

669
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
More

670
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,344
Tied to the political system and more encumbered

671
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
Then someone like Alex who can give full-throated condemnation right and then ramble about stuff that's really exciting

672
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
Bright whether it's true or not in many cases

673
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
And I can really see

674
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
Do that

675
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,728
Would make him pretty attractive to people who

676
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
Can't understand why people are having a conversation about whether you can torture people

677
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,016
There were some people especially we're representing the military almost always

678
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
Who were just so

679
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
The heminsley pro-torture

680
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
You know they would have those

681
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
Fox News two heads

682
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Two sides like man, was fine with waterboarding until they want water

683
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,936
Boarded-up yeah yeah

684
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Amazing

685
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
It's just it's just

686
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
Incredible disgusting

687
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,128
So Alex realizes the hey man maybe there is some first-time caller

688
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
Probably lay out who I am

689
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
What am I about

690
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
What are you doing

691
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
And wonder what we're all about

692
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
America

693
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,168
We believe in controlling our borders we believe in

694
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
We believe in

695
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
The big brother

696
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Lowering taxes

697
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Nation

698
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,224
We're mortal enemy

699
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
Add also demons Walk Among Us really needs a devil that feature more heavily in what's going on

700
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,768
Right now cuz the sales pitch of

701
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,096
I am opposed to torture

702
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
You're going to get people to wiggle off the hook

703
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
If he look like

704
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Also

705
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
I fight literal Satan

706
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,640
I do understand that liberals you're all just working for the devil

707
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
Yeah that would have been a tough for sale

708
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Yes to be like

709
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
No no no

710
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
I know you think that the royal families are the problem

711
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
The Rothschild

712
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
At the end of the day the only person who would really torture

713
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Like Alex is talking a lot about like

714
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
You know vaccines and what have you but

715
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
Fauci doesn't come up

716
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,336
Does not come up strangely

717
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,896
He knew that he knew all along that she was bad

718
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
I mean except for that stretch where he did a shoes and things

719
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
Like monetary stuff and

720
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
It seems odd

721
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,744
Seems very strange

722
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,096
Bill Gates is not coming up

723
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:40,192
Anyway not a whole lot of content on this episode

724
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,032
But there is an interesting breakdown that Alex has

725
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,640
Where he decides to start talking about how like he doesn't watch TV anymore

726
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Definitely

727
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
62

728
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
A very long

729
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,016
Ramble

730
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
More than

731
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
Literally I get nauseated

732
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
Hillary Clinton

733
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Not watching TV

734
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Market

735
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,080
I understand it's better to not

736
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Spend a lot of time watch

737
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Watching TV

738
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
This is your job

739
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Yeah

740
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
You're just making other people do your job now

741
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Yeah

742
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,575
I mean you could you could hire somebody to do it for you

743
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
A lot of shows

744
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
In fact

745
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
Everyone Late Show

746
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,535
Has a writers room dedicated almost entirely do watching s*** all day

747
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
That's true

748
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,679
I'm even on the on the flip side of head like let's let's look at this let me like

749
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,543
Listening to Alex's show sucks I don't f****** enjoy it much

750
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,431
I'm not going to crowdsource that's 37 like listen I'm not doing good job

751
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,015
If you guys want us to talk about something Alex just said

752
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
Send us the clips on you

753
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,903
I can't handle it anymore cuz it sucks

754
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,767
I must subject you to the thing that you put Alex call-in show

755
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,863
I thought this was going to be short but it is it is not because Alex

756
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Fix

757
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,959
Something of a physical response sure

758
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Kaylee

759
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:25,055
That's so intense the feelings that I'm getting from him right back.

760
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
He's supposed to be going to call

761
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Shivering

762
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,271
It goes on it just goes on and on

763
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Walk around home

764
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
And

765
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Alright

766
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
But I literally

767
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Headache

768
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
And

769
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
So painful

770
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Started getting nauseated

771
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Because I

772
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
Control

773
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
You think that

774
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Headache

775
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
7 cake

776
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
I get it to keep it through explaining that

777
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
I can't stand to look at these people I

778
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
One more time

779
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Why you got to

780
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
And not only is he going to say if he's going to say he's going to consult the police a little bit

781
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,215
He has a misconception that like okay you know

782
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Police

783
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
It's got to be tough

784
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
To see somebody that you know is guilty

785
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
Get away with a crime

786
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Sure

787
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
But it's not nearly as hard as what Alex have to put up with

788
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
Bigger cross to bear

789
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Murderer

790
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
And I watch him

791
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Really.

792
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Bringing back those images

793
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Alright alright

794
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
So this goes on quite a while

795
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Wow

796
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Does he think that

797
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
More explaining memes

798
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
He gets more sympathy from me

799
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
Cuz it's the universe

800
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,031
The more you explain why I should be sympathetic to you

801
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
The less empathetic

802
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,383
Maybe he doesn't

803
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
His point is been made

804
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
You know

805
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
I think that sometimes he feels like

806
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
I have to come up with another way to say

807
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
Eating the same right he's he's like oh my God

808
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
Better keep eating it

809
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
So

810
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
This doesn't eventually

811
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
I'm going to guarantee that Alex has been watching plenty of

812
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,311
But you get the call

813
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,895
From somebody who wants to know about a

814
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
A draft piece

815
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Legislation that Alex is pushing

816
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Oh boy

817
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Here we go

818
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,927
Forward my resolution

819
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
Define

820
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
Are you sure

821
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Confirm

822
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Vulcanized

823
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
County

824
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Members of the council before

825
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
In the morning

826
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Refuse

827
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Hell yeah

828
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,951
Really interesting cuz I think it really boils down Alex's approach to politics

829
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
Where we seen them play this out on a number of occasions like when he was obsessed with state legislators passing bills to affirm the 10th

830
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
Amendment for a few months of 2009

831
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
He does this s***

832
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,287
What's what happens is that identify a perceived threat

833
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,127
And come up with a completely symbolic and meaningless solution to it

834
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,967
He's mad about the Patriot actually want States

835
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Institution is real

836
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
Weather in Northeast 8th pasties bill

837
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:33,439
That is no effect on whether or not the Constitution is real

838
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Is the pr ploy

839
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
This may work in some places but not many

840
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:44,447
Most governing bodies would be able to see that this is a purely symbolic entirely meaningless act and to pass a bill like

841
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,007
This would only serve to give the appearance of folks like Alex

842
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,823
Have real institutional power within the party

843
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
This would be giving me Fringe right-wing the appearance of a victory with nothing actually achieved and nothing gained for the

844
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Politicians themselves

845
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,343
It would in effect be the government's ceding power to the fridge

846
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
Which is unlikely to ever happen

847
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
In normal time

848
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Without a fight

849
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,023
And that's why the second aspect of Alex's strategy comes in

850
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,351
Where he tells people to decry politicians who won't play ball

851
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,399
Is people who spit on the graves of veterans

852
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:21,311
He's basically hoping that this kind of threat will be enough to get these politicians to go along with his meeting was Bill and that will to some degree

853
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
Allow Alex to demonstrate his own relevance

854
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,663
And influence within mainstream

855
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
Text without anything getting done

856
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
And no risk actually being taken

857
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,855
This is the model that you see often in the right-wing media but

858
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Why don't things have kind of troubling is that in our last episode we saw Marjorie Taylor Greene basically playing the same game with her

859
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Congressional accountability Act

860
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
When people lament that the right-wing has become

861
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
Conspiracy-minded and like Alex

862
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,215
I don't think really keep an eye on his how much is it

863
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
The folks like Marjorie our governing

864
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Like Alex knife

865
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
As opposed to just

866
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Saying the kind of

867
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,687
Think Brett Congressman should be here

868
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Okay

869
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
All right so they can

870
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
They can vote

871
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,831
Anyways

872
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
Now they'll Superbowl

873
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,695
And if they don't do it we will

874
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,815
Harass let me throw this out

875
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Cover-up artists

876
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Let me throw this out at you

877
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,167
Here's how useless

878
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
That bill is

879
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
You Alex's bill

880
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
You couldn't write a bill

881
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Saying that there

882
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Not in

883
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
Effects aha

884
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
Right so it doesn't matter

885
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,807
If you if you can't write a law saying you can't do this there's no point in writing a law saying you can't

886
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,903
Right it's not like some town in Florida could

887
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
Write a bill that says you have to quarter soldiers

888
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,839
That's not how it works

889
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,935
Nope nope nope and you can't have somebody who's like you have

890
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Have to quarter soldiers

891
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,239
Because here

892
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
We don't even worry about the Constitution

893
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
What are you talkin to

894
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
I didn't go anywhere

895
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,783
And neither does this f****** episode cuz we got one last clip and it's Alex making another dumb

896
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Prediction

897
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
Malia

898
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
Before the War Began

899
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,207
How does monkey

900
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,359
Ford

901
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:09,759
So it's fair that these are real documents and that Judicial Watch to get them released but the cover

902
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
To them is a little bit skewed

903
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,159
16 pages of documents do include a map of Iraq soil fields

904
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:21,023
But it also includes a map of the oil fields in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab

905
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:28,447
It seems safe to save these documents show that Cheney and his energy task force were aware of Iraqi oil fields prior to

906
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
But the larger picture of a set of documents make it difficult to use as definitive proof that the Bush Administration did

907
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,663
11 or started the war specifically for oil

908
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:44,063
Whether or not you believe that to be the case for other reasons these documents are not good proof for that conclusion because they also

909
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Oilfield

910
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,927
In other countries that weren't invaded to be counter-examples

911
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
To the presentation that Alex

912
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Who's making about Kentucky

913
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,095
Larger picture though this is a good example of how Alex covers stuff

914
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:01,983
There's some documents that got released but he can exaggerating sensationalize and in order to amplify their importance

915
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,079
Please address the bush might set off a really small box

916
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
In order to distract from these documents

917
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,479
Yeah this very common for him and probably the only reason we don't have a clip like this

918
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Every episodes cuz I ignore this s*** most of

919
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
The time

920
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
This'll get tedious

921
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
Like I mean just simply

922
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,327
You don't need to set up a nuke to get people to not pay attention

923
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Did you dishel

924
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
True

925
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
You know I would be

926
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Interested to do some national polling

927
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
To see how many people even know Judicial Watch

928
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,591
But I would say a lot of people probably.

929
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,943
To be fair in 2003 Larry klayman was not

930
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,527
In charge yeah that is true

931
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
This is not a claim enjoy

932
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,159
I mean to distract from Judicial Watch you could probably like

933
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Turn the lights out

934
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,767
In a little part of Nashville and the whole country be like

935
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,583
Well we don't need to pay attention to Judicial Watch now there's this

936
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
Lights out Nashville

937
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
It's not that big of a deal

938
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,239
Yeah I think to distract from this

939
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
You could

940
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
I don't know televised

941
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,407
Concert

942
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,807
Celebrity covid messages on basketball

943
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Call Ann

944
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
British accent release documents

945
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,975
So we don't

946
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
He starts off.

947
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Weird weird story

948
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
Juan Carlos

949
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,863
The weirdly I thought this had to have been about the fact that

950
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,143
The night before this

951
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:10,239
There were two bombings a popular Spanish Resorts and allacante

952
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
And Benidorm

953
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:16,895
For sure that's what the story because

954
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Of those bombing

955
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,271
They instituted a curfew I thought for sure that was the case

956
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:28,671
It's for that to be the case to Resorts that were approximately 29 miles apart so obviously a terrorist attack

957
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
Required coordination

958
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:34,047
And a basque separatist group called the ETA had to take

959
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Responsibility

960
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,351
I was certain

961
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,167
But this was a situation where there's a curfew

962
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,543
McKay's never even brings up those Bahamas

963
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,151
This actually is kind of what Alex is klimek

964
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:56,063
The mayor of a town in Spain

965
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,135
Vienna by 9 on Thursday so they could do chores

966
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
It's real B it is been up

967
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
F******

968
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:07,839
Love it I think it's great Thursday isn't that to be ladies night from that on

969
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
This was a guy named Javier because of decisions like this he lost a re-election for mayor the next year

970
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,335
This was ultimately an inconsequential human interest story that will happen

971
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:24,735
You act like a silly clown

972
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,783
Taqueria

973
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:33,439
This story might be relevant to the people who lived in that town but the idea that Alex's were boarding

974
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:38,815
What is a national radio show is some kind of proof that men are under attack life out-of-control feminism is

975
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Comical

976
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Motor out of a

977
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:46,495
Zyrtec by the Mad Hatter

978
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
Everyday and imagining that this had anything to do with one car

979
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Oculus

980
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:59,551
I feel like a better use of Alice's time if someone is interested in important

981
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
Bombings resorts

982
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
Table for

983
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,135
What happened

984
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
That would make

985
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,719
These talk about dudes out of Spain

986
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
Bulshit like this

987
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
As opposed to

988
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
Who rides

989
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,167
Where foreign Nationals right right but I mean come on

990
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,239
Ladies night on Thursdays

991
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:24,127
That's a fun story that's more fun to talk about the bombing but it shows it shows the level of content that Alex

992
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
Got2b quipped

993
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,711
22 Rockaway

994
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,295
He never talked about anything but like

995
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,111
Ladies nights in weirdo towns that's great

996
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:40,255
I bought an RV I'm going to check it out ladies night

997
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,559
Ladies nights

998
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,655
Diners lies and Drive-ins that's what he's going to do it

999
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
And it's all Luby's

1000
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,799
Bad news about the Luby's close

1001
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,823
So

1002
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,359
We have Alex

1003
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,783
Bouncing around talking about talked about topics gets into a little bit of fluoride stuff

1004
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Causes bone

1005
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
Written the night

1006
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
Literally

1007
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
AR

1008
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Retarded

1009
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
What

1010
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Secretaries

1011
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
Organization

1012
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Berkeley

1013
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
University

1014
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
Cornea

1015
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
New world

1016
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
From here

1017
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:10,015
That's a complete lie.

1018
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
News item

1019
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,855
We revealed that

1020
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:20,255
Brave New World is actually my brother's plan from the beginning

1021
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:26,655
Yeah you can go to listen to Brave New World Revisited if you want it's as readily available online at it and no point in it.

1022
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,007
Aldous Huxley say the Brave New World is based on a secret government plane is brother told him about

1023
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
What you doing

1024
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,919
Nor does he cackled maniacally like of the supervillain he would be if that were true he does not

1025
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
This is an absolute lie

1026
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,551
I can get this Alex knows that it's a lie I know that he knows.

1027
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,647
I can say with confidence because he uses selectively edited clips

1028
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,463
Of Brave New World Revisited in his documentaries

1029
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,559
In order to get those clips that he uses he would have to be familiar with the larger context

1030
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,655
I need help to you'd have to know that he's creating a distorted manipulative image

1031
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:03,007
Also we talked about this a hundred times in the past with fluoride doesn't dumb children down

1032
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,663
It's a positive and has dramatically reduced dental problems in this country though there is definitely a concern about it having a dangerous

1033
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
Effect in high enough doses

1034
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,599
That's what the studies used referencing are which he's like about to apply to the incredibly low moppets in tap water

1035
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,415
Alex says a lie about fluoride witchy

1036
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,767
Can't backup if he's forced to actually get into the details about it so it's

1037
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,839
He just distract with a side story about how the addition

1038
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,631
The fluoride in the water

1039
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,079
It creates a fun conspiracy for The Listener to make themselves afraid of

1040
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
But it's bull

1041
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,991
Fluoride terrifying now look over at these jangling keys wahahaha

1042
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,575
Alex runs out of gas a bit

1043
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
About 40 minutes into the show he's been

1044
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,183
Talking about nothing

1045
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,719
More or less nothing

1046
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
And

1047
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,071
Par for the course

1048
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
Oh boy this was a

1049
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
That's not

1050
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
Because this first color that he gets

1051
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,007
Is itching for a fight

1052
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Is

1053
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:13,663
This is very exciting you know we have this stretch of time where there's really not much going on

1054
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,503
This is where I felt like business is really going to pick up this guy

1055
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
This Canadian weirdo

1056
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
Idiot

1057
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Horrifying

1058
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,735
I'm one of your dishes done so I hope you don't

1059
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Cut me off

1060
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
I'm a Canadian

1061
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
The u.s. troops

1062
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
End the war in Iraq

1063
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Hello

1064
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,719
Canadian

1065
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
And we're not a bunch of

1066
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,399
We did it in Vietnam also

1067
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,471
Dodgers

1068
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
Canadian

1069
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
They didn't have

1070
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Did you know that

1071
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,199
Jordans

1072
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
Vietnam

1073
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Do you twist

1074
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Manipulating the news every morning

1075
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
The biggest news

1076
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
Story this morning

1077
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
What's the killing of Saddam

1078
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,215
You apparently haven't heard about that.

1079
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,063
One of these guys

1080
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,231
Weasel weasel

1081
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,559
How excited I was

1082
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,911
The last few days in the show has been a slog of Alex rambling but nothing

1083
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:14,239
Canadian weirdo seems like a shot in the arm but Alex is going to need

1084
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
To get his game face on

1085
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,359
It's a perilous situation sometimes listen to these callers

1086
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
They almost always just agree with whatever Alex is saying but in the cases where they disagree with him their offense still assholes

1087
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
A wrong

1088
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,439
That's the kind of situation we have here this dude in Canada's pumped about the Iraq War who wants to emasculate Alex for not being mad

1089
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Manly enough to support it

1090
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Pretty font

1091
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:40,351
Kind of sucks though and it was looking like I was going to have to side with Alex

1092
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,983
Obviously opposition to the war is the right position

1093
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,543
F****** bomb on Alex's play

1094
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,895
This is like 40 minutes into the show and it hasn't really covered

1095
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
Any actual news

1096
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,015
Arizona slow day but saddam's kids were killed that day

1097
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,623
And I'm honestly not sure if Alex would have even gotten to that story if the caller had brought it up

1098
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,279
Alex's whole thing about a rack is that Saddam has been secret it out of the country and is living on some Island in luxury or paw

1099
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,863
Possibly in Russia so it seems like it could be a little hard from decide

1100
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,655
Where to land on this story

1101
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,567
If he accepts that it really is Uday and kusay who died then he probably assumed recalibration to do on his

1102
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
Narrative

1103
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:28,735
How are the listeners supposed to believe that Saddam was taken to a beach resort but somebody's children were left in Mosel and killed

1104
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
In a firefight with US troops

1105
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,343
That seems like a hard story to make stick

1106
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,439
Conversely on what grounds is Alex going to be able to claim some kind of conspiracy

1107
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:41,791
To hear does it go with like a body double Theory or does he just deny that it happened

1108
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:45,375
This is a piece of news that I can definitely see Alex being a bit reluctant

1109
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,935
Takis position on immediately because

1110
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:54,335
The implications it could have four other larger narratives about the war are are real and they're more important for him

1111
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
You got to think about this

1112
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,455
I do love the collar is forcing his hand on this issue

1113
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,271
But I have to say it's very clear that this is

1114
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
This guy is probably a huge ass

1115
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,975
Not only did self-censor he almost said you're sure taking your sweet ass time about it and then he was like

1116
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,767
You are you sure took your time

1117
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,839
You get there. Canadian polite

1118
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,167
So

1119
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
But I'm going to say thank you and please

1120
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Salix I was causing a weasel

1121
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,359
Things like hey hey weasel

1122
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,175
Your point though here we go and so here's the first attempt

1123
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
Let's do it

1124
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,255
So this really doesn't do much the counter with the caller said

1125
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:22,655
The caller said that he was tired of all the Braves go to something like that

1126
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,495
That is a Ron Paul was a doctor in Vietnam and he says the war is bad

1127
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
It's basically an appeal to Authority that

1128
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
It's pretty much

1129
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
Meaningless in this conversation

1130
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,407
I was waiting for him to reply with

1131
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:39,039
See the royal family owns all the tabloids I don't know about Barnard Pediatrics

1132
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,623
But I guess equally unimportant

1133
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
The boy that's going on

1134
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:50,303
So far this seems like a bit of flailing on Alex's part possibly attempt a pop-up Ron Paul's military service

1135
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Credentials

1136
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
That's the first point

1137
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:58,751
I never get to the second point which I guess is about the fact that Alex hasn't covered Stomps kids

1138
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
Number two

1139
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,319
I'm sorry what

1140
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
NyQuil night

1141
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,767
They claim that they killed

1142
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,591
It smells of b******* Alex's position was the globalist

1143
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,151
Constantly report two people are dead but actually aren't

1144
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967
He would have led the show talking about others is a big

1145
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,039
Cover up in there today and kusay weren't really dead

1146
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
He didn't do that

1147
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:20,671
Until no indication of even being aware of the story until the collar

1148
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,975
This sounds more like defensiveness

1149
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:27,327
Alex does bring up some cases of misreporting that have happened in the haze of War

1150
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:33,727
In April 2003 Aldi Hassan Al majeed or chemical Ali was thought to be dead after his Villa

1151
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,775
In Bozrah was the target of an airstrike

1152
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,871
The New York Post reported on the situation and quoted Rumsfeld the same

1153
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,943
We believe the reign of chemical Ali is come to an end

1154
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:49,087
Additionally they spoke to a major in the British 3rd Battalion parachute regiment and said they'd recovered quote

1155
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,135
A body that was thought to be meje

1156
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:58,303
This book like a fairly safe assumption to make give him the information coming in put it all to mately turned out to be wrong and that can

1157
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,095
Can happen when you're talking about

1158
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,887
Casualties in the aftermath

1159
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,423
Immediately have an airstrike

1160
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:10,335
What's Saddam himself there were instances of rumors of his death being reported by Western

1161
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:15,199
It was ever officially said that he was dead like strong confirmation

1162
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,735
I think somebody did

1163
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,807
Start singing you something like chemical Ali

1164
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Evil is he

1165
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,903
Now he's dead

1166
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
Ali Ababwa

1167
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Saddam had a lot of enemies and it was in poor health particularly in the early 2000s

1168
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
The rounds

1169
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:44,639
There was a part of this reporting is probably something of a psych Warfare tactic meant to make Saddam look week

1170
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,759
Inspire one of his Rivals to be like on Now's the Time to seize power

1171
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:54,367
Not necessarily a good thing but if that was the strategy it kind of makes sense right

1172
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
In the case of Uday and kusay

1173
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:04,351
This wasn't a rumor or a possible killing from an airstrike this was the on-the-ground fighting that happened in the troops released

1174
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
Photographic evidence confirming

1175
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,215
That's a Dobbs children at one of his grandchildren were killed

1176
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:14,079
U.s. troops were also tipped off to you today and kusay his whereabouts by the guy was letting them

1177
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,639
Stay with him fairly strong until

1178
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,687
Even prior to going into the fight

1179
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:25,855
I can understand Alex's into instinct or skepticism but it's leading him off track here in the territory where you just assume that everything is fake

1180
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
Lake without any justification

1181
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,231
Instances of misreported that's in the past but that doesn't

1182
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,559
I mean that every death it's reported as a fraud and the only way you

1183
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,887
You can really tell is if you engage with the actual reporting

1184
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,031
You can't even gave the current Story by just Gallagher about things that have happened in the past because ultimately those things in the past

1185
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
Don't have a direct impact

1186
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,359
At the present story

1187
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,991
Also I'd be remiss if I didn't stress that the cases that Alex is talking about being fake in the past

1188
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
And the case of storms kid

1189
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,599
Two dissimilar to equate to one another

1190
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
Suspect

1191
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:05,023
Someone is killed in airstrike like in the case of chemical Ali Israel until that someone wasn't a certain place

1192
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,839
Finding them there and then getting into a gun battle with that right

1193
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,375
It's very very different

1194
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
Ultimately the feeling I get from this is that Alex didn't plan on talking about this story weather because he didn't know about it or because you didn't want to stay

1195
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Stake claim

1196
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:22,687
I feel quite strongly that this clip is essentially him talking around the issue in a way that allows him to

1197
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,759
Call the take a later if you want

1198
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
He's like I know I have to respond to this and I'm going to try and do as much as I can

1199
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
To like

1200
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:39,327
So maybe he'll quit and I can just stop talking about it I'll be able to have time

1201
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,143
Time to think of something better I have to defend myself

1202
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,959
From the assertion that I didn't talk about this

1203
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,031
And I don't want to make a definitive claim perhaps

1204
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:53,919
And so the way to defend myself is to be like aha I didn't talk about it cuz I'm too smart about it

1205
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,759
I do it rings.

1206
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Yeah it rings A Little Falls

1207
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
Because

1208
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,927
What he does is just trying to shift the conversation

1209
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Record

1210
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
Alec can I say something now

1211
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,063
Okay

1212
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,391
As one that Alex read

1213
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
It's exhausting

1214
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,559
This conversation and he's insisting of collars called him a liberal social

1215
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:49,471
This is the effect of taking the argument off of the territory where Alex really is nothing to say

1216
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:53,055
Into a framing where the caller is going to have to respond to strawman

1217
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,199
You were saying we're liberal social that's for being against the war but most conservative person in Congress Ron Paul's against the war

1218
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,527
Are you against Ron Paul and thoughts about really conservative

1219
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,135
It's a cheap game but I found a prospective it's a super effect

1220
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
Debate tactic that Alex

1221
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,535
Constantly personal insult will help keep people from

1222
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Weasel

1223
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:22,495
Alex has presented it to this caller there's a yes or no answer he can give the takes

1224
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,799
Conversation nowhere productive

1225
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,847
It's essentially meaningless if it's

1226
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:32,735
Conservative or liberal to be for or against the war but this is the water Alex wants to swim in because that water is f***

1227
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
In shallow

1228
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:37,343
To be honest Alex is going to win this argument no matter what if it goes

1229
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
Keeps going this way because

1230
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,719
This guy is going to have to defend the war and now it's going to yell over but that point

1231
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,535
Those are 22 kills this caller has

1232
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,631
The climb and no one who thinks it's a good idea to call Infowars is up for that kind of work

1233
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,679
You bet it's just not good although

1234
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,519
This caller gave me some glimmer of hope okay because

1235
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,079
Alex is really trying to Rattle him

1236
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:58,847
And

1237
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
D2e credit

1238
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:05,503
Whether intentionally or not this caller does the one thing you can do in that situation

1239
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,999
I'm talking about you did you ever did you serve the military

1240
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,311
Mercenary Army

1241
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
Good work

1242
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,935
You don't have any

1243
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,031
So you can see something really remarkable I have in there and I'll bring sharp Focus

1244
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,895
What else is doing is trying to Rattle off as many as he could and attempt

1245
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
The Foster the color

1246
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
The goal was too overwhelming with things that he's a

1247
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,319
Expected to respond to and avocado tries to respond to any of them

1248
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:17,183
Well there's that response pre-loaded

1249
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,583
And and and even if somebody he doesn't and the caller response to something Alexandra say like you didn't respond

1250
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,375
Find all these other points that I made

1251
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
Yeah discolored

1252
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:31,519
Exactly the thing that Alex couldn't handle and that's what he ignored all of Alex's destruction

1253
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,079
The point he was kind of trying to make

1254
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:40,735
The color never brought up Ron Paul or whether the war was conservatives that was all Alex trying to put a position on him

1255
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:45,855
From everything I can tell the color seems like you just want to argue with Alex about him being the coward

1256
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:51,231
Weirdly didn't cover the story about Saddam son

1257
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:56,095
Though I'm certain he's a complete a****** I applaud this color for not taking Alex's bait and you can

1258
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,887
Kind of see what happens at that point

1259
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
How it's essentially deflate

1260
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,495
Like okay

1261
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,287
Points which really just mean

1262
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:09,151
Disappointed that he didn't get to bicker about Alex's chosen points

1263
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,759
Alex Goes many dokkan which is the most insulting the shows

1264
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
Weston Democrat

1265
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,047
Really brought up political labels at all almost everything you see going on is a piece of window dressing

1266
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,071
Alexa setup

1267
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:32,447
In order for this argument to play out how you want to do is color isn't playing ball with that

1268
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Fascinating

1269
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:38,079
Iic sucks though I think it's fascinating that it seems as though

1270
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,127
He did settle

1271
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,175
On one position which is

1272
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Ron Paul is my shield

1273
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
Alex

1274
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:50,367
Yeah so it's like I don't even have you I don't have to get through this rhetorical barrier

1275
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:56,767
Ron Paul is the most conservative cell I don't even need to think about my position right now I've got rampal

1276
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Pause the shield

1277
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
And then tomorrow I can come up with a good kid

1278
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
Conspiracy theory right now rampal is

1279
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:08,031
Blocking my shield and then my distraction is this laundry list of all these other talking

1280
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,175
I don't know if maybe was assuming like I assume you talked about Blackwater or

1281
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,479
I want to go to 54 Nadeau or you at

1282
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
Yeah

1283
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
Collar stays on point

1284
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
And besides

1285
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
What dude

1286
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
The sob story

1287
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
Wait what about that

1288
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,999
Come on man you got to talk about sucking let's do this

1289
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,559
Gettington

1290
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
Utah

1291
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,655
Grown out with Millions

1292
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,215
I know here they are in back.

1293
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,391
Well this time they have the party

1294
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Now

1295
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,191
Okay

1296
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
This is humiliating for Alex

1297
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:14,848
You can tell the positions on

1298
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
The caller

1299
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:22,016
Alex really isn't making much sense with his insisting that the deaths of Stomps kids must be fake because there's been misreporting Antipas

1300
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,856
So he decides to ascribe to the collar of position he didn't take

1301
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
That the government never lies to us

1302
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:33,280
This is another instance of Alex he's in the same trick he tried unsuccessfully by appealing to Ron Paul

1303
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:38,400
He wants the conversation Beyond his term so now he's trying to force the caller to make one of two stamps

1304
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,264
He confirm the position Alex's forced on him and say that's government never lies to us

1305
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,872
Alex guilty off about time the government lied and then claimed victory in the conversation

1306
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:54,528
Or you can reject the position and Alex will have an inroad to say so you admit the government lies to us and I'll prove that this one isn't Delight

1307
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,880
Exchanges like this are really interesting to me because

1308
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,696
It's actually really rare to see Alex's brain working

1309
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,256
Micah in this in the sort of Arena

1310
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,328
I passed a lot of the colors you would get would be as fans or

1311
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
Sometimes it just be annoying like the Republic of Texas people have all declared themselves president of Texas

1312
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Really mad about it

1313
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,664
In the present-day this stuff never really happens at all and if there's disagreement about something from a collar Alex

1314
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
7 hang up

1315
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,088
It's rare that is actual debate techniques are on display if you pay attention to them you can see that almost all of them

1316
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
Easton misdirection

1317
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,720
He's trying to avoid any underlying argument and I suspect it's because

1318
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,536
What the points is color brings up or a bit threatened

1319
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
To him

1320
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,960
41 it is true that Alex never brought up Saddam son's being killed which seems like a mark against him as a journal

1321
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,264
Even if he thinks it's all fake

1322
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,360
Seems like someone who talks about geopolitics on his show so much and

1323
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,408
A lot of thoughts about the Iraq War

1324
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,248
Bring up people saying that saddam's kids are dead but he thinks

1325
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,832
Bulshit if that's his position I mean on the day that's probably the

1326
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Most

1327
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
Important geopolitical news

1328
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,208
You better do that which is weird

1329
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
Weird

1330
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,584
Secondly it is true that Alex never serve the cont

1331
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,680
Which could be a sore spot for a lot of the military obsessed people in the audio

1332
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,008
I was born in 1974 so he would have been a

1333
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
18 + 1992 + 8

1334
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,384
What about knowledgeable to go fight in Somalia or in Bosnia

1335
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,992
I understand that he wouldn't have wanted to or might have even been philosophically opposed to it

1336
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,088
But he wasn't even in something like a ROTC in high school or when he was in Community College

1337
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:39,232
Is audience is particularly focused on the military but only a part of that has to do with service to the country

1338
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:45,888
The other part is kind of a cultural thing where there's a distinction between the people who would sacrifice and subject themselves

1339
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,960
Do a thing to require such a heavy amount of discipline

1340
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,056
It kind of sets you apart from people who didn't go through an experience like that

1341
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:59,200
If I were Alex I probably would prefer that this was brought up Israeli as possible and this color does seem

1342
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
To be hitting some softbox

1343
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,040
And not taking Alex's distraction bait

1344
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:06,880
What are my point here is that Alex really actually isn't good at

1345
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:13,792
He's a bad debater if you're aware of Justin Bieber's really basic tricks he's trying to pull and really most of the things he had

1346
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,608
Hasn't his toolkit are just yelling and hanging up on people

1347
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,936
It's really it's really interesting to see this

1348
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
This is this

1349
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Is empathy

1350
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
In terms of

1351
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
I like

1352
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:28,128
A back-and-forth yeah I mean it's impotence in the sense

1353
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
I'm a

1354
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,248
The conversation itself was to have any meaning what

1355
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,320
I mean it is also one of those

1356
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,440
Demonstrations of how stupidity

1357
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:46,048
Can appear to be Authority you know where it's like the fact that he

1358
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
He is the one in power

1359
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,376
Despite having nothing to say

1360
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
He gets

1361
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,936
To say the last word every time

1362
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,776
No diffuse both of these points

1363
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,360
Easily without talking about Ron Paul

1364
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,664
You can say like

1365
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,688
You can talk

1366
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:07,552
Lie about his opposition to the war is conscientious

1367
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:11,648
Nah-nah-nah participation in war right he could do that

1368
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
And that would be fine

1369
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,208
That would

1370
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:18,560
Possibly alienate some people in his audience for his military service is so important

1371
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
Right there maybe that's

1372
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,632
Part of the reason why you wouldn't want to do that

1373
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,424
I don't know but he could do that

1374
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,520
Simultaneously with the story about saddam's kids

1375
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,176
Look I think obviously that's the biggest news story of the day you would expect the next show like his would lead with that but

1376
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,736
He could defuse that instantly by just being like

1377
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Look

1378
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:45,440
Overload to lay out the editorial structure of my own show the way I want to and I understand that you think that they should

1379
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,232
I've been brought up at the beginning of the show

1380
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:53,632
But I have a method to how I'm doing things are going to get to it I appreciate you bringing this up

1381
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
To the Forefront

1382
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,752
He could have done that very easily and diffuse this point entirely

1383
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,336
If you wanted to be full of s*** he can even meet like we have internal metrics

1384
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:06,688
Most people tune in around Deccan.

1385
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:12,064
Yeah if you could do something like that sometimes we like to warm up at the beginning of the show

1386
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Maybe

1387
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
Even how about this

1388
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,928
A lot of Affiliates don't pick up the first hour

1389
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,232
That would work perfectly

1390
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,280
Eddie

1391
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,328
This mess of just half

1392
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,352
Half-assed

1393
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,400
Go to debate tax

1394
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,984
Grim I mean if you wanted to really be like

1395
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
Fine f*** you let's go into my world

1396
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,848
Just just be like oh you fought in Vietnam

1397
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,128
How did that work out

1398
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Was that a good idea

1399
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,736
That's about it that's a bad move cuz this guy probably would

1400
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:44,064
But he wouldn't he wouldn't back down

1401
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,136
Think about how that turns from

1402
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:53,536
You know if your service or any of that s*** and takes it all back onto him it would but then Alex

1403
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:57,376
Would end up having to engage in some substance with a guy comes back at him

1404
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:03,264
Crimes that the government lied about in Vietnam

1405
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,384
Engage with those animated bunch of

1406
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,712
Vague pieces of information that he kind of remembers

1407
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,784
Goodnight scattershot way that he did with

1408
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,184
I bet the instances of rest reporting stats

1409
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,488
How to do it there a million different ways to die

1410
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,792
He just doesn't have a sword

1411
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:30,144
Honestly the better way I was to do this shock-jock s***

1412
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,544
Like you should just be like you have the queen on your money I totally totally

1413
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Bulshit

1414
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,896
Yeah because engaging but also not

1415
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,432
Is transparent

1416
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,040
He a job he's doing and that is

1417
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
Piano

1418
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,136
If you're paying attention to the show Alex does not come off well he know

1419
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,440
Could come off really funny

1420
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,744
And also dismissive of this person

1421
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,280
If you were just to like

1422
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:02,400
Alright want to fight boy

1423
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,984
So the long nose like WWE Do-Right

1424
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
You're m***********

1425
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
Yeah I think that it's the

1426
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,408
So

1427
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,456
911 comes up

1428
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
Sure

1429
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,272
What happened

1430
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,880
Well Alakazam ideas about what happened okay so I Diaz he would not

1431
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:28,256
Admit he supported the present that I didn't say that

1432
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,048
You know that whole pentagon

1433
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,072
911

1434
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,120
Story that's what you claim never have

1435
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
Call remote

1436
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,080
Control

1437
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,480
Melon Portugal

1438
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,880
Good Wife watch online

1439
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
Murdered

1440
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,296
Cease using that trick again total

1441
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,576
Please adjust a long list

1442
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,368
The tenuously connected talking point

1443
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
Alex is able to pull out of his memory

1444
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:32,768
In order to try and overwhelm the collar and make it appear that he can't answer any of this stuff

1445
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:39,680
All this is 9/11 truther stuff which isn't really relevant to Alex didn't

1446
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Join the military

1447
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
For how Alex didn't talk about Saddam son's being

1448
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:48,384
I will blame the caller for bringing up a 911 stuff though

1449
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
Exactly

1450
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:56,320
Make sure the caller has nowhere to go and his boss

1451
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:00,672
The only thing that can really counter this is ignoring it all

1452
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,488
And staying focused on the point that you were discussing to begin with

1453
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,816
Is the solution to this kind of attack.

1454
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
Just kind of brush it aside

1455
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
It's because

1456
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,960
Did well substance wise all Alex did was go

1457
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:18,080
Baba baba baba baba baba baba baba

1458
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:22,944
Great. You just ignore that distraction can only really be countered by staying on target

1459
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,552
But all too often responding to the items and Alex's laundry list is just too tempting

1460
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,112
The color doesn't actually do

1461
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,136
Either thing

1462
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:35,488
11th stay on message and at the same time he doesn't really respond to something Alex said

1463
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
It's did you choose has a new road to go down which I found a little bit confusing and I think he's lost the three

1464
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
Okay

1465
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:50,848
Canadian troops United States

1466
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:56,224
We don't have any Canadian troops in your country

1467
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:27,456
This color was doing okay at dodging Alex's shift for a while but I think he lost the plot now

1468
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,528
You didn't get distracted by something Alex said though which is weird

1469
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
He distracted himself

1470
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,624
Basically over now

1471
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
Alex is pimp

1472
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,976
The caller into a bunch of positions he didn't take in the actual point of the call

1473
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:45,632
Been long forgotten by anybody casually listening to this show

1474
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:52,032
When do the couple times you probably legitimately wouldn't remember why this call was happening

1475
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:58,432
1812 when Canadian soldiers burned down the White House is that what he's going though I think he's talking about Alex

1476
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,760
Theories about florist proofs

1477
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,344
The UN bringing in foreign troops

1478
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,392
Side of the country

1479
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,184
Alex's audience will just

1480
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,584
Hear this exchange is a time what a Canadian who thought the government was always truthful couldn't handle

1481
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,656
Any of Alex's going to thought Alex was a socialist called in

1482
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,936
And Alex school then

1483
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,984
And that's the goal of these debate actor

1484
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
Fix that Alex use

1485
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,336
They create the impression if you're not paying attention

1486
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,128
But Alex's

1487
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,152
Killing it

1488
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,712
Most of his listeners are paying attention

1489
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:35,040
So they'll probably come away from that thinking like I'll name you nailed that

1490
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:41,440
I mean it's always it's always a unfortunate truth that debates are

1491
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
Despite

1492
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,792
Supposedly being about words and ideas almost entirely about emotions

1493
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,072
Save-A-Lot of Optics

1494
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:47,840
Stop

1495
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,216
A lot of it isn't really worth engaging in

1496
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
So

1497
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,616
I thought this girl was pretty much over cuz I felt like well we've completely gotten off

1498
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
The point

1499
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
At hand

1500
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,712
And both of them are kind of

1501
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,480
Gotten

1502
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,528
I'm confused on their own

1503
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:10,112
But also if there's some insults that need to go around good

1504
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,976
You hate America you're a trailer

1505
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
You will hate your country

1506
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
New World Order

1507
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,336
Context Mars I had every one of his books

1508
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:33,152
You know what I did recently I threw them all in the

1509
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Trash can

1510
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,552
This is pretty f***** up for a number of reasons

1511
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:15,136
The first is that I was saying that he goes to text Mars's Church

1512
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,928
And attacks performed as wedding

1513
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
I would have thought that text would refuse to do that weddings and Alex's first wife was Jewish and text is a huge

1514
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,192
Alex going to Texas Church

1515
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:33,312
A Texas a giant anti-semite there any sermons were often it really anti-Semitic

1516
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:38,432
I want to go to ride on a technicality though and I was writing books

1517
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:42,272
Going back to 1983 which would be 20 years prior to the show

1518
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:45,344
But his first book that he wrote with was with his wife

1519
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,624
I found was titled quote

1520
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
A perfect name for your pet

1521
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:53,280
This was not an expose I'll do World Order

1522
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
Legs

1523
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,144
Four of them a couple years later Texas output with change

1524
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,264
And he started releasing books with titles like Rush 2 Armageddon and dark secrets of the new age

1525
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:08,896
1987 only a few years off but strictly speaking Alex is right

1526
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:12,992
I'm not necessarily bring that up to Pat Alex on the head I'm putting

1527
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:17,856
Illustrate that I think Alex knows a whole lot about text Mars and it's a big fan of his work

1528
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:22,976
What I say the text Mars was a career I mean that

1529
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,768
He was a bigot early and

1530
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:28,096
Two of the books You released in the years before his death were titled quote

1531
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,656
DNA science and the Jewish bloodline

1532
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,680
And quote

1533
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:36,032
Holy Serpent of the Jews the rabbi secret plan for Satan

1534
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,616
Crush their enemies and voltage Global Dominion

1535
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,712
Yeah he was an anti-semite and he's about 16 feet also

1536
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
And he was a

1537
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,552
Like the he's heavily influential

1538
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,880
In a lot of the lot of them

1539
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,440
Definitely will not admit

1540
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Nowadays

1541
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:59,328
Alex would not talk about how influential and important xmars is in

1542
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,352
2022

1543
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:06,496
No I don't think many of them want to lay claim to their intellectual forbear

1544
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
Cuz if you will it was a little bit less problematic for Alex to be upfront

1545
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,712
About these bodies Association dragons like

1546
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,016
Sort of places where his intellectual lineage go

1547
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Couldn't get kicked off Facebook

1548
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,464
Text Mars is a disgusting bigot and I appreciate how much more forthcoming Alex is that being one of his followers at the

1549
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,864
This point I'd get into this more deeply but I have some thoughts about doing a larger series on text so that might be

1550
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,400
What we deal with at that point

1551
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:40,288
Also I sure hope that Alex doesn't ever find out what text Maurice thinks of his buddy Ron Paul

1552
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:43,104
The most conservative member of Congress

1553
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,152
Frenchie's

1554
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
Overall things

1555
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,528
You can talk

1556
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,744
Hell

1557
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Pandora

1558
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:29,184
Okay LOL Ron Paul

1559
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,280
Text Thomas from what was the title of that sermon

1560
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:39,936
Ron Paul is a takeaway my tax-exempt status rampal is a pro-homosexual

1561
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:42,752
Will pervert the title of that song

1562
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,288
Yeah

1563
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,824
Text Mars

1564
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,872
Yeah yeah little hater

1565
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:55,040
Both the sense of

1566
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:58,624
Yeah so after the call Alex

1567
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
Debrief

1568
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
Because

1569
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,208
I think he went through something

1570
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
Compartmentalize

1571
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
Name-calling have an emotion

1572
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
That is just

1573
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:27,808
Projection

1574
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:34,464
They both called each other a bunch of names that definitely was not one-sided and for the most part it was Alex who refused to stay

1575
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,000
Stay focused on anyone topic

1576
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,656
He was the one doing the shotgun blast of a million topics I'm talking points and you know what I think that Alex was also the one who was acting

1577
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Emotionally

1578
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,960
His emotional outburst

1579
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:49,824
Might not have been his theatrical is they are the present-day but this caller

1580
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,152
It brought out something from Alex and it wasn't analytical

1581
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:59,552
There was composed person just methodically going over the fact that was a guy lashing out

1582
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,368
But doing so using Shady rhetorical tricks

1583
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,184
To make himself seem composed while doing it

1584
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,744
Right now what happened was the guy said something

1585
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,536
And he was like

1586
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,352
I'm not ready for this so he was he was afraid

1587
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
Right

1588
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,400
And then that fear

1589
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
Let him to feeling angry

1590
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,240
And that anger

1591
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,520
Leads to hate

1592
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Alright

1593
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
And that hate

1594
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,920
That's the dark side baby on the dark side of the Minecraft story

1595
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
So

1596
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
Alex is

1597
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,368
Kind of focused on this call for a bit

1598
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
Left right

1599
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Ron Paul

1600
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:53,824
Alex is building up this way for his audience to remember and Havoc

1601
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,384
Experience the call that doesn't match up with

1602
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,664
What the call actually was

1603
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:02,784
Kind of a Telltale sign that Alex recognizes that he kind of whist

1604
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,112
Kind of kind of dropped the ball on that one

1605
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:09,696
Yeah I mean generally there was this book

1606
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,512
That really had a lot about that cuz

1607
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,048
What would happen is

1608
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,400
You know something would happen in the government didn't want you to remember it the way that it happened

1609
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:25,056
They wanted you to remember it the way that it should have happened sorry I was distracted there or you talkin about Men in Black

1610
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:34,528
Real dystopian kind of tactic if you will if you know what I'm saying

1611
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,832
People would have written about

1612
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,112
So we

1613
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:42,720
Most of the rest of the show is Alex interviewing his friend George Humphrey

1614
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,024
Movies talked about in the past

1615
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,560
He's a weirdo but

1616
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,352
Kind of boring

1617
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,656
Not really

1618
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
That

1619
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:58,080
How to describe the kind of boring he is

1620
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Not really

1621
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
No and it's

1622
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,920
Kind of just another Alex

1623
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,784
Kind of like a less interesting Alex being interviewed by Alex and Hell

1624
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:12,416
I don't really care all that much but there are a few clips of things that happen

1625
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
Auburn the first is

1626
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:16,768
Hypothetically Alex has to start off the interview

1627
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,328
By complaining about that last caller

1628
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,864
Georgia

1629
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Alex

1630
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
Good to hear your voice and

1631
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
You and I both

1632
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,480
Charge

1633
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,320
Patriotic

1634
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,648
Didn't I call her do me dirty George

1635
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:49,792
Comfort me about this caller who

1636
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:56,192
So can he fight. Anyway he hasn't for a long time

1637
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,240
There is a lot of that to be said

1638
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:04,640
Obsession with trying to do after care about

1639
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:09,760
So this call it's just bizarre tell me how good

1640
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:13,088
So at least they take some calls Alex and George

1641
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,672
This caller brings up something that I think Alex

1642
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
Say

1643
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
You need to get help

1644
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:23,072
Whatever you're imagining you're experiencing

1645
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
You're not

1646
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
I'm guessing Alex does not

1647
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,192
And are also like

1648
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
To make another point

1649
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
Just real quick

1650
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
Hawkins

1651
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,288
Making out in my air

1652
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
New World Order

1653
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
No because I was in the

1654
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
And I've been calling

1655
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
Elastic

1656
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,504
Black

1657
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
Flying a flying a

1658
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Come up to me

1659
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
How does the owner

1660
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:46,880
Supermarket

1661
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
Hey

1662
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
Need to stop talking

1663
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
We know where you're at with

1664
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
Can I come home

1665
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,560
Another day and they were putting

1666
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Anthrax

1667
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,608
In my house to USB

1668
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Guns or something

1669
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,032
Like that

1670
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,568
Those two have thing I had

1671
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
That I wasn't

1672
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,664
My house

1673
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Let me breakdown

1674
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
What

1675
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
They have

1676
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Wow

1677
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
Yeah

1678
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
Sir please there

1679
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,768
It sounds like

1680
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:29,120
Outside of your mind people are concerned about you

1681
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:33,472
And I'll maybe you are somebody who has some military service in your past

1682
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,008
And maybe

1683
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,288
You have some illegal weapons

1684
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,080
Baby

1685
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:44,480
You're telling people all about Alex Jones and black helicopters flying all over your house which only give you need to calm down

1686
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,016
Hoo-boy man

1687
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,552
But yeah the military

1688
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,832
Put Anthrax in this house

1689
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,880
And everybody

1690
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,464
Is gang stalking him that is so like

1691
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:59,328
I mean can you imagine if they read it it's like I've Ken Kesey Road

1692
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,144
One Flew under the Cuckoo's Nest and Nurse Ratched was like

1693
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,544
Yeah man

1694
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,384
I mean to some degree

1695
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,176
What he's doing

1696
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,016
I feel like you have a responsibility towards

1697
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,040
Towards folks

1698
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,880
Especially when it's public

1699
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:25,184
Like a private conversation

1700
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,536
I think you still have that responsibility but publicly broadcast

1701
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
I just

1702
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,120
I think that what you're doing is

1703
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,400
Modeling

1704
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,984
That it's okay for people to experience these delusions

1705
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,032
And not to be like

1706
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,616
Not to recognize the people around them might be concerned about them

1707
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,664
There might be good reason

1708
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,200
No it's s***

1709
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:50,016
It keeps real trap it's giving a blackout drunk

1710
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,064
The gift of a gallon of whiskey

1711
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,856
And being like hey man

1712
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,648
You're more fun when you drink

1713
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,720
And it's like you're if you're killing this person

1714
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:04,352
Alex has some news also on this episode

1715
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,120
About

1716
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:08,192
Spain bombings nor about saddam's kids

1717
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,984
But it is about some

1718
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,544
Proposed amendments to the Patriot Act

1719
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,384
How old is really really excited about this

1720
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
At the end of this play

1721
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,064
Pahrump cell

1722
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,256
I wrote

1723
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
We just take the time out to

1724
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Please

1725
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,232
Modification

1726
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
And I

1727
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
Library

1728
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,712
It's so weird

1729
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:00,320
That you can ignore someone socialism when it's convenient

1730
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,088
I mean

1731
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,160
This is just another one of those things where you're like

1732
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,952
Everybody likes

1733
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
Do you know why

1734
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,280
Cuz if you maintain good

1735
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,632
Consistent ideological positions from start to finish and you act

1736
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,168
In accordance with those

1737
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:18,496
Regardless of whether or not people are lying about you

1738
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:23,872
Because if you do this chances are you actually kind of are above the left-right paradigm

1739
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:27,968
Everybody winds up being like wow that's right

1740
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,992
Good call

1741
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:33,088
It's so weird for Alex like constantly be going on about like

1742
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:37,696
Cows socialists are the devil and left-wing people are the devil

1743
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:41,536
The person in Congress that is to

1744
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,584
Side with Alex's s***

1745
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
A bit

1746
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,656
More than anybody else is Bernie

1747
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,448
Whether it's through this

1748
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,264
Third Lake

1749
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,848
Basic Allied things

1750
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:57,408
Should be able to recognize like

1751
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,224
Hey this is socialist seems to

1752
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,504
I mean I think

1753
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,784
The most ironic thing

1754
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,344
Is that earlier on he's talk

1755
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,368
Walking to Canadian

1756
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:08,416
And he's assuming that the Canadian is

1757
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,976
Calling him a socialist because he's against the war

1758
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,560
References that one thing

1759
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,120
4 is a socialist Center

1760
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,960
Who is against the Patriot Act so it's kind of like

1761
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:21,984
You know

1762
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,200
I'm at the store fits

1763
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,016
Another bit of a little bit of a pattern on this episode and that is

1764
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
Is dumb predict

1765
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Bushes

1766
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,856
Approval rating

1767
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,648
About 8

1768
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,696
They've been cut

1769
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,000
Coming down

1770
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
I think they're it about

1771
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,520
So whatever the number is

1772
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,312
The number get

1773
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
Down

1774
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Below the

1775
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,128
Magical number

1776
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
45

1777
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
Start initiate

1778
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:04,992
Getting and they've already got the

1779
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,296
I do not

1780
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
That they will do

1781
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,856
I think that there is

1782
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
Some sword

1783
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,416
What is called

1784
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,376
Amber will be here

1785
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,448
The fact is

1786
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
People operate

1787
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,520
Off the

1788
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,288
Beer

1789
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,312
The Americans

1790
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:30,848
And it would be

1791
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Zoe's

1792
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,176
I think that they will wait

1793
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,200
Until

1794
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,224
The end of this year

1795
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
Early neck

1796
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
Here

1797
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Institute

1798
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
Another of

1799
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
They didn't

1800
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:48,000
Go f*** yourself with this is a operate off-field

1801
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,536
You do that

1802
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
Let's do it like

1803
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,096
Constant

1804
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:54,656
Obsession and preoccupation with this

1805
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
Imminent

1806
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
Fake

1807
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:01,056
Constant everyone's about everyone's about to die.

1808
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:07,200
It's not like they're going to blow up the building or biological attack of smallpox

1809
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:13,600
Fox getting released

1810
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:17,696
This is this is fear run roughshod is is the way

1811
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,512
Operate Mucci constantly

1812
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
It's just it's it's a it's effective

1813
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,912
Yeah and there's so many people that you really do

1814
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
It's like

1815
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,752
Oh you actually do believe that but not because

1816
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,336
And it's true it's because that's the only way you think

1817
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:40,992
You can't imagine somebody operating in any other facet cuz that's the way you operate so if you operate that way

1818
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,040
And you're the smartest person in the world

1819
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,832
Obviously didn't clearly

1820
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,880
Your enemy must operate that way

1821
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,160
Because if they're smart

1822
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,208
Then that's the way you do it

1823
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,768
It can't be that I'm a big dumb dumb

1824
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,816
Manipulating exploiting people

1825
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
And in fact

1826
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,144
Hurting the people

1827
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,216
Are exploiting people and they think you're dumb

1828
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,800
Yep I think there's a lot of projection

1829
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:10,688
I mean it's the exact same thing that I stayed in the aftermath of that fateful call from Canada then project

1830
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
Eating all of his own

1831
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:15,296
Deficiencies and in bad behavior

1832
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,344
Helen Keller was guilty of a few of them

1833
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,904
I don't know

1834
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,976
To be a really rewarding

1835
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
Nothing to hear

1836
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,048
Alex's

1837
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,072

1838
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:33,472
2000 fun to get those in the present-day anymore

1839
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,240
Gold like that

1840
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,800
Even though you got to sit through hours of

1841
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,080
Nothing

1842
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
To get there

1843
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,480
I think it's breaking in the past was

1844
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
Learned

1845
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,296
Dialysis present

1846
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:53,696
0 transphobia not even on his mind no I know of course it's their under

1847
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,512
But he doesn't have to say it

1848
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:02,912
Probably not aware that same people exist

1849
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,728
Old to be mad about it ain't that the truth right

1850
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:08,800
So much of it

1851
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,848
Inferi be

1852
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:16,480
Like long-standing things that he says they are

1853
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
Whether it's

1854
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,832
Klaus Schwab or fauci or

1855
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:24,160
Right like there's a there's so much of that whether it's

1856
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,720
People who are supposed to be villains or

1857
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,304
Cultural issues that he's decided r r

It doesn't matter it doesn't that stuff doesn't exist Eric he's mad about neocon

1861
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:41,568
I mean he is right though I do remember that in 2003 the Cubs

1862
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,848
Went to playoffs

1863
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:47,968
Yeah they didn't make it to the national championship

1864
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:53,344
