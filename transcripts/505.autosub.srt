Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
We're going to do but sit around

6
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
Technology Beverages and talked a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Giordano Giordano Giordano

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

9
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
My bright spot today

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Paradox

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,104
Sickly very strange the thing that you

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,736
Left soon as you've probably realized after eight months that you should have been gone from it

13
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Mutations

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Because I find

15
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
But it's just us

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Match with

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
It's the way my brain works

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,584
Not no shade on people who do enjoy it or or like Twitter and Facebook

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Can stuff I I just did it

20
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
It's not for me

21
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
I've gotten older Iraq

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Recognize that it's

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
It's confusing

24
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
I don't like

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
I was running the knowledge fight Twitter account

26
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
And it became a thing where it's like I know I'm using

27
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
This

28
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,320
Everybody listens to the show knows I'm using this Shore

29
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
So if I post

30
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Promo stuff

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
It feels dirty

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah

33
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know

34
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
Reversion to self-promotion

35
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
Anyway the reason that I

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,168
Turn on the bright spots

37
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
What are ways that social media can be used

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
In ways that are fun

39
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
And not

40
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Dumb

41
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Everyone keeps asking for pictures of my plants

42
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Started an Instagram account

43
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,528
Caldera plant underscore fight

44
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Forever post pictures of plant

45
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
I like it so like

46
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,560
I like periodically feature different plants

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Dan's Wild

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Kingdom

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
It's not connect

50
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Did the show he's not

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Do intrusive on my personal life

52
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,408
Nice sweet spot and some of the people enjoy people like seeing

53
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
I think so maybe this is a function that social media cancer

54
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
I still think most

55
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
Here's what we'll do I'll make an

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Instagram account

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Parts for my two dogs

58
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
People have asked

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,608
Pictures of Bulldogs I'll go with Westies underscore fight

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Will compete to see who's

61
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
I guess

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Growing things are better

63
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm afraid that your dogs are

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Cuter than most of my plants

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
I think I probably was

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
That is true underscore fight

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Popular

68
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
I don't know about that

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
About how it but it is

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
What specific reference

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,768
In Valhalla that I particularly enjoyed

72
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
That came out of nowhere

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
Which was a reference to one punch man do you know about one punch man

74
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,776
Vaguely yeah about a

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Very depressed guy who can defeat anything and anyone in one

76
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
You told me about that

77
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Essentially destroyed by that

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
Like how bored and awful it is to to be the

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Ultimate power in the universe

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:16,000
That he's just a real bummer all the time and there's a perfect referee

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Prince2 that

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
In Valhalla where you have to fight a girl

83
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Spoilers

84
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,775
Okay the real bummer about it could guess that was going to be more alert

85
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
So it's very very very funny

86
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
I have a great

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
I don't know what the deal is

88
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
But I lost a bunch of

89
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Time

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Corrupted save

91
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
But I ran into problems that happens when you play games when they first come out

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Not really used to

93
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,775
But I I had there's a mission at a certain point

94
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Spoilers

95
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
You talked to a guy and then you've got to get

96
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
To another city

97
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
You got to take a boat to

98
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
To get to the other City

99
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:15,135
Every single time after I talk to this guy the boat would spawn

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Like in the middle of land

101
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
As if it were a horse

102
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
So I had to go back

103
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
To buy most

104
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Resent

105
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Auto save file

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Anahit autosaved

107
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
So many times

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
Wow that boat was chill there you restarted like 50 times in all your auto-saves

109
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
Back to where the boat was last saved before that was

110
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,671
Great Towers

111
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Is very frustrating but it is what it is

112
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,095
The same thing happened One mission all the sudden every time I load

113
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,447
To save the entire screen would just start shaking and veggies and then

114
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
My character would just fall directly through and then

115
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Fall Forever Until It

116
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Until she died

117
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
Even even great games sometimes are a little problem release bugs

118
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
It's really exciting for me to is that like

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
I have I know that

120
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Age of calamity

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
The Zelda game

122
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Hyrule Warriors

123
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
I haven't even

124
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Touched it

125
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
Oh got it I haven't even thought about it

126
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
No and that's a

127
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Nice feeling

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
To know that that's there

129
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
If I ever ever

130
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
We may not ever happen

131
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,455
Are you got another 80 to 100 hours later

132
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Calamities they're working for

133
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
That's a nice

134
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Comforting feeling

135
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,231
How do I add second bright spot back

136
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
I was one down to Georgia

137
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
People

138
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
Made audio version

139
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,543
My parodies on which is level of

140
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Oh yeah

141
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,943
Quite frankly uncomfortable with but I think his delightful that's a lot of people

142
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
Put put my music

143
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
I don't know if

144
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Is there a sequel to The Devil Went Down to Georgia

145
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Charlie Daniels version

146
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
But there's a million

147
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Mine was a sequel that's true that's true

148
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
I know there is nosql

149
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
I figured they know it can't force it

150
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
But Alex said he went down to Georgia.

151
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Kids was

152
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Knox

153
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
What I wanted

154
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
It lacks a lot of the charm

155
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
And the fun of the Caravan

156
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Because the Caravan allowed me to

157
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
To paint a picture

158
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
As in this case it's kind of Alec

159
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
The pictures

160
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,143
You realize every time we get excited for something we're talkin about

161
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
People who turn every good thing into s*** yeah yeah we're at we're getting excited about the potential

162
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
But never gets realized

163
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
F****** Lucy

164
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Charlie Brown

165
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Every time they set up that football more like

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
We're going to f***

167
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
Can do it this time

168
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
It's going to be a caravan field goal

169
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,487
Going to be amazing and then they slide it out from under as a guy

170
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
It is

171
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,727
Some fun to be had along with a number of interesting things that I want to bring up and discuss it.

172
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
The course of this

173
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
But we're just going to be talking about November 18th 2020

174
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Is 120

175
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
Oh you're still told you we're still alright with it

176
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783
Accepted I also want to say that when I discuss this on the last

177
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Episode

178
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
I was actually the stuck in my craw a little bit

179
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
I said that you were

180
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Submitting

181
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
To the B

182
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,023
And I don't actually that was not the right choice award I meant surrender

183
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
Surrender is that was the word I was wondering

184
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
You come up with that work

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
In your crawl

186
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
I was laying in bed with a

187
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Surrendered

188
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
The real name of this one

189
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Because I am I take the

190
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Trip to George's pretty unimpact

191
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Actual I think that

192
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
It's it's repetitive

193
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
In nature what Alex does when he's on the road

194
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
And at the same time

195
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
There's enough stuff that happened during this episode

196
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
That's worth

197
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Talkin about that

198
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Headed to try and force it and do like

199
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679

Close to 150

205
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
We are currently on day 4 of The Scourge

206
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,399
Gun-toting Daleks running around the streets

207
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
To keep an eye on

208
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,591

221
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623

Next fella asked

223
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Give me to say how I thought his last name was pronounced

224
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
I know this was just because it

225
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Looks like weiner sure

226
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
Maybe maybe

227
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
His weiner

228
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
It's I think it's rarely

229
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,407
I mean like a Matt Winer is new the guy who made Adventure

230
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
The first name wrong

231
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991

00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,719

Thank you so much to our Representatives

248
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895

Hammond Louisiana

Thank you very much to the both of you

251
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
It's pronounced quokka

252
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
I probably

253
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
So if you're out there listening to take a nap

254
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Website

255
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
If you are experienced any kind of malaise or perhaps existential

256
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Prices

257
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
What do

258
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
You should do is fill yourself with

259
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
The generous spirit

260
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,871
Channel that Chi energy all the way up into your fist

261
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
And punch

262
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,735
Local charity or bail fund but metaphorically

263
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Alright that works

264
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Jordan

265
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
This is the reverse

266
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
The Caravan

267
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
This is and I don't know why I didn't

268
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Didn't see the novel Rock

269
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
I don't know why I didn't see this in advance

270
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm so blind

271
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
I'm Snowblind to like

272
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
What actually going to happen

273
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
Because like Alex going down to Georgia

274
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
But I forgot that that means that I wouldn't

275
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Is going to be hosting the show

276
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Anna and like yep

277
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
I forgot

278
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,111
The flip of the dynamic from the Caravan wear Owens out on the road and Alex's

279
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
Throwing to him in the field now he's got it

280
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
God

281
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
And I was just like

282
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,071
As soon as you get into it you're like oh no

283
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
How does a how does Owen try and really pull off 3

284
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,263
Lazy does it is he mostly plays a live feed of Alex

285
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
And Ally Alexander yelling in Atlanta on this episode

286
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Hopefully there's

287
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
And the episode starts with Alex doing a little bit of a mess

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
This is the mark of the beast of Revelation

289
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Which is not coming this year

290
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Can you show me the

291
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Baptist churches and Catholic

292
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Directions to plug in the QR codes

293
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
So Alex is God

294
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
Fear of QR codes QR codes are

295
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
15 years

296
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
It's been around for awhile

297
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Advancement of the same idea behind

298
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Which is used by many retail outlet

299
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
I say many

300
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,207
Because if you don't want to use barcodes and UPC scanners to ring up products

301
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
You don't have to

302
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
No you do it compelled by the mark of the beast

303
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Compelled by the market

304
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Efficient

305
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,519
The main reason I pulled this Clippers to illustrate how deep into the nonsense Alex's

306
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Start the show off

307
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,359
The second reason I glued this live is probably boring for

308
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
It's to use this as an opportunity to explain how people like Alex or broken records trying to make everyone afraid of everything foreign

309
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
No reason

310
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
QR codes or something that Alex is trying

311
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Pescaraz audio

312
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
It's about an interesting Lee if you look into the history of the thing I proceeded QR codes

313
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
The UPC barcode

314
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
You'll find a sterical people doing the exact same thing

315
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
50 years of

316
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
According to an article about you PC history and wired quote

317
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,239
When the first UPC scanner has arrived in the early 1970s

318
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
According to various IB Evers who worked on the

319
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
The project

320
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
There were protests at grocery stores

321
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
Even though the codes appeared on Coke cans and jars of applesauce

322
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
That's not right

323
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
4 heads

324
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
I love

325
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
End-of-the-year that followed

326
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
An urban legend a rose Ward

327
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Gullible types of the number 666

328
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
It was hidden in each barcode

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
Some of these paranoid types noted that there were often

330
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
10 sixes in the barcode which were in fact Arabic

331
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
But it doesn't matter

332
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Again from the article quote

333
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
Early test films of the scanners were labeled with the letters f g and H

334
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,823
And some saw this is proof that the code would wind up on more than just Coke

335
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
Assisting the eighth stood forehead

336
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
And the app

337
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Her forearm

338
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Sure people do this

339
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,783
It's inevitable because James at the future are both scary things

340
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
The more complex the system is the greater possibility it has

341
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,463
In terms of productivity and Effectiveness inability to help people live Better Lives

342
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
But as that

343
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Complexity increases the theoretical damage that

344
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Make a calls go up to

345
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
A simple example is just the internet

346
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
The ability for people to

347
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,519
Communicative digitally interact over great distances its revolution

348
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Canary in terms of information

349
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Inflow directing

350
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Charitable assistance

351
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Places that need it

352
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
But it's created a gigantic Tinderbox they could

353
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Exploded anytime

354
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,575
For instance back in 2013 the Associated Press has Twitter account got hacked

355
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,415
And a fake tweet was posted about two explosions going off at the White House

356
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
That injured President Obama

357
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
This wasn't

358
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
True but the effect on the stock market was

359
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
Is real and it's the byproduct of evolve

360
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
Volatility that would not exist

361
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
Without the ability for information to travel

362
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,335
Almost every technology could imagine could be slotted into this kind of ballet

363
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,919
Having a centralized Power Company in your town relieves you of

364
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
The burden of having to run a generator yourself

365
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,367
But also if there's like a bad storm in your area in your whole block might end up losing power for a while

366
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
The complexity of emerging Technologies provide

367
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,767
B benefits but also increases the problems when something goes wrong

368
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,911
Alex is just one in a long long chain of hysterical idiots yelling about how some new ish

369
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
Not even that new

370
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
Is the end of the world

371
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Rambling about QR codes

372
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Just like his forefathers

373
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
You protested barcodes outside grocery

374
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
It's a real bummer that

375
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
John of Patmos

376
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
Really maligned more efficient

377
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
Consistent like maybe if Satan were less of it like God is kind of a Luddite in this scenario right so the Antichrist

378
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
Hey let's give everybody a mark so we can do the whole thing

379
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
You can do Commerce

380
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
You can do all this stuff

381
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Yeah I get that can be abused

382
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Splitsvilla boruff

383
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Alright

384
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
God is out here like look everybody free will f*** that

385
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,383
That gets everybody complicated see what we're talking about what Twitter people are jumping out there lying

386
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
In the stock market in 2 seconds

387
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
What the mark of the beast on everybody forehead

388
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Call it a day

389
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Right

390
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
I lost myself entirely the message

391
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
All right let's do that

392
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,863
You have a hypnotic power today Georgia that worried about it

393
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
So

394
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Alex's on

395
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
The seeing in Atlanta with Allie and

396
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
The beginning of the show is

397
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,431
What appears to be a pre-recorded or I could have been live I'm not entirely sure thing of them

398
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Disorder yelling

399
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
An ally has

400
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Some big news to break

401
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Just one example of Georgia radar

402
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
Morning Georgia Republican party chair please pick one of our monitors

403
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
9626 are in DeKalb County that is in Atlanta

404
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,951
And 13 for trunk

405
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
Biden would have gained enough votes from this one back to loan to cancel out

406
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,679
Vulcan we have to audit the vote

407
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
That's why Alex Jones and I are here

408
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
So Allie is reporting based on a tweet that was posted by David Shaffer they had to

409
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
The GOP in Georgia

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
But it's a very misleading

411
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Think we've designed to be used by bad faith actors like Alex

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,391
Some alley to fuel their machines that they're trying to use overturn this election

413
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Basically what happened was this

414
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:18,303
They're conducting his recount in Georgia and during the recount someone made a recording

415
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
That is the same thing mistakenly put down over 10,000 votes for Biden

416
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
When in reality the total was just over 1,000

417
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Providing at 13

418
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Never Trump

419
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
His mistake was caught in the recount

420
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
That's what Shaffer is yelling at

421
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,711
Discounting error was not made in the initial automated count

422
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,807
So it does not actually affect the total for the state at all

423
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,415
But that's the impression that Schaeffer's and Alex's coverage resigned to leave the audience

424
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Sure

425
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,071
The ideas supposed to be there sleuths uncovered 9000 votes from the actual election for Biden that were erroneous

426
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
When reality someone involved with the recount made a mistake and

427
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
In the process caught it

428
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
Before it actually was a big mistake

429
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Yeah that'll happen

430
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
The DeKalb County CEO released

431
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
The statement the basically said that they were unable to verify the

432
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
The claims of this error

433
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
But to put it in my words

434
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Even if everything Schaefer said is true

435
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
It doesn't matter

436
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,831
Quote Twitter storm

437
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
A little surprised by the tone of this week

438
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
It was more about

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,584
A Twitter storm the alleged

440
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Discovered reported

441
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
DeKalb elections officials and correct

442
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
Did prior to the transmission

443
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
How the official audit report to the Georgia

444
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Georgia Secretary of State's office

445
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
If the scenario occurred is Jeremy Shafer Legends

446
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
This is evidence

447
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Subutex imbalances established by Georgia Secretary of State Brad raffensperger to ensure the accuracy of the election results

448
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Performed as designed

449
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
As is always the case with Alex and Ali this is a dud but

450
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,256
It's a dud that they're probably going to use as a piece of evidence of fraud

451
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,072
Yep

452
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
It's not

453
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
Somebody during the recount accidentally put an extra zero

454
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
And then they found it

455
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
And now it's all over

456
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
More or less

457
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Stop yeah

458
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Okay cool

459
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
But it's not just Georgia

460
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Thanks America

461
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Delton Michigan

462
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
Breaking news on the situation that is just explosive kind of Hollywood gangster movie

463
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,536
Wayne County Michigan that Detroit other Republicans to Republicans

464
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,352
Did you Democrats it on the board

465
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:33,984
Republicans decided not to certify the election but under duress and threat from hundred

466
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
Get the secretary of state would do an audit we are in legal and cost

467
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
What all you saying is inaccurate but let's pretend for a moment

468
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,752
That would mean that the Republicans on this Council he's talking about we're willing to certify an election that they felt was fraudulent

469
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Because people were mean to them on

470
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
On Twitter

471
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
Alex Haley is saying that like it's an understandable thing like the leftist

472
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,736
Just to meet on Twitter they had to certify the results

473
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,320
Will when you see mean things that's how it does that's how the

474
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
American Revolution started

475
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
Sure there's the taxation thing but George's like these guys are a bunch of

476
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
The Dixon

477
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Yeah yeah

478
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
It's like

479
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
In the Declaration of Independence cyberbullying comes up a lot

480
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Ellie singer

481
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
The people

482
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,848
Tweeting the stuff this mean stuff is like the equivalent of having a gun to your

483
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Ridiculous

484
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
If it's your job to make sure the election is fair and your decision-making process is in any way affected by would someone on Twitter

485
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
You proven

486
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
Exactly one thing and that is that you're not qualified for your position

487
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
The Wayne County Board of canvassers met

488
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,280
To certify the election results broke down on a party-line

489
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
With the two Republicans William Hartman and Monica Palmer voting against certification

490
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
Have the Democrats voting

491
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
For

492
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
At issue was the number there's a number of Precinct ahead and onyx

493
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Explain discrepancy

494
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
The info total

495
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
According to the Detroit Free Press

496
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Quote most of them recorded discrepancies of

497
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
3 votes or fewer

498
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:26,368
In 2016 there were similar discrepancies in voter totals in Jill Stein's campaign it pushed for a recount

499
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
This recap was ended by a court order before it could become

500
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
Completed but after the election was over

501
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
The state of Michigan did do an audit

502
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Headed found that a vast majority of the

503
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
Explain discrepancies were easily explainable by human error

504
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
And the quote many of the problems encountered in

505
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
Detroit are attributable to a lack of proficiency

506
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Using

507
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Epi

508
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Cpb software

509
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
Or the mishandling of provisional envelope ballot

510
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,576
They found their audit that votes were accurately counted but that there were mistakes made in terms of being able to correctly match

511
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Devote with its pallet

512
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
Because of these various human error

513
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
It's incredibly likely

514
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Almost to the point of certainty

515
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
The same phenomenon is present here in the

516
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
20 election

517
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
Ultimately Palmer and Hartman agreed to certified the Wayne County results with the Democrats on the board agreed to do an audit of the

518
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
The vote but apparently Palmer and Hartman didn't realize that the audit would

519
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,408
Be literally impossible to do prior to the certification of the election

520
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Head so they tried to

521
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
To work a certain

522
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Invocation witches

523
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
That's worth

524
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
I think Stan right now

525
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
The certification after the letter

526
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,792
The cynical minded fellow out there might to think that the real reason to Palmer and Hartman decided to recant their decision

527
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
The Trump called them personally but

528
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
What do I know

529
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Not Ronald McDaniel V

530
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,008
Republican National committee chair is calling from Michigan to adjourn their board for 40

531
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Teen Daze

532
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,360
The bottom of these very serious or possibly wildly overblown issues

533
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
At the point of us recording this episode we don't know how this is going to shake out

534
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
Because the board in Michigan is set to certify on Monday

535
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Does in the future from us right now

536
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
All signs appear to indicate that like

537
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,928
Georgia they will certify the results

538
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
But this world

539
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Who's f****** insane

540
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
So I'm not going to take

541
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Anything for granted

542
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Why not

543
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Is there a word

544
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Precinct Andrew Johnson in there to hell

545
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Johnson to come back

546
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Their issues of voting

547
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
Discrepancies that

548
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
AR

549
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Norwalk

550
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
And that is something is being weaponized

551
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Bialys

552
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
And one of the ways that he's doing it is just outright lying

553
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
They're still calling but they did go ahead and say they're going to certified because

554
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
That's just categorically not true

555
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:58,944
Alex and Allie are making this stuff up knowing that no one in their audience will question that Margo consult attorneys

556
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
16 audit which I would bet anything I own

557
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Even these two dudes

558
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Don't know exist

559
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856

2016

579
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
Approximately 392 Precinct

580
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Appear to be out of balance

581
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
If you combine the in-person and absent

582
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Multi-county boards

583
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
2020

584
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
You have a decrease of

585
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
230

586
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Teen out-of-balance Precinct

587
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
In this election

588
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,432
Compared to 4 years ago not double but that's

589
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
By 10000

590
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Each time

591
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Sure every single one of those is

592
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Is it an accidental adely adding of

593
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Thousand

594
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
Stop these numbers probably sound high and they kind of are but these are almost

595
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,328
Entirely indicative of minor human errors that do not actually affect vote

596
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
But they do lead to accounting problem

597
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Princeton

598
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
The audit report discusses the case

599
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
In 2016 a Precinct 15

600
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Have to wear these sealed ballot

601
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Container

602
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
50 volts and at the end of the night

603
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
But the rules indicated that the

604
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
306 votes

605
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
7 cast

606
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
This was because poll workers that accidentally left the rest of the ballots in the tabulator

607
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Failed to put them then

608
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Container Store

609
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
It's a problem and it will lead to a

610
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,768
Discrepancy but it doesn't actually have any bearing on the vote tallies are being there was any fraud

611
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
Most problems that you'll hear people like Alan

612
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
What's y'all about fall into this category and I would be willing to venture a guess

613
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
The in a few months

614
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Whenever there is an audit of this election

615
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Which Alex will ignore by that point

616
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,104
You'll find a lot of similar human

617
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Have you ever

618
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Counted to 1000

619
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
And then

620
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,320
Counting to 1000 with two people over your shoulder

621
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
6 ft away from you going like

622
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
No

623
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
That's one more for the other team

624
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Lego course you're going to get

625
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,816
We're all I meant look in Mario Party 6

626
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
Thought there was a little mini game where you had to remember the order of fruit

627
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:35,360
Number for fruit and sometimes my friends got it wrong

628
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
We were high as hell when we were playing

629
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
But still

630
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Sure

631
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Untie my buddy Swearingen

632
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
Grapes to remember

633
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
I think it was great

634
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
A pluralized it

635
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,584
And I wrong

636
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Is it 4 a.m.

637
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
It was that

638
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
Scattergories argument

639
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:06,848
Everybody got into weird. Where the I think it was the GameCube had a microphone

640
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
That you could have like

641
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,480
Couple voice command it would recognize you.

642
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
Banana

643
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Break

644
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
You got it wrong even though you had the right

645
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
I think so yeah

646
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Lives on in my memory

647
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Forever

648
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Anyway my point is

649
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
The people can make

650
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Mistake people make

651
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:31,936
The larger Point here though is that Ally and Alex are completely wrong and absolutely just making up but there's record levels apriso

652
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Since being out of balance

653
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
They have no idea what they're talking

654
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
About the actual numbers are the exact

655
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Consider their narrative

656
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
There wasn't record discrepancy

657
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
If you go by the

658
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
District numbers there was a

659
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
54%

660
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
Decrease in precincts reporting unexplained to scrap

661
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Is this Alexa

662
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Incycle

663
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Seems like a progress

664
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
Yeah that would make sense considering up for the like 3 months up to

665
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
To the election everybody Wisconsin

666
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,584
Silly screaming about how there's no possible way that this would be a fair counted election so everybody wet

667
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Overboard

668
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Because of those

669
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,776
Discrepancies that happened in the 2016 election there were probably a lot of conversations about

670
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,592
Little things that could be done to limit

671
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,688
I mean obviously you'd like to see that number even lower but

672
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Stop much of a decrease

673
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
From one

674
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
Presidential election to another

675
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Seems like

676
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Pretty good

677
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
I don't know

678
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
I mean it let's say we've got

679
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
What is it

680
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,840
Almost 150 million votes Caster over 160 million now something along those

681
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
And we have

682
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
It's

683
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,264
50% of the County's and wash in Michigan

684
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
In 2016

685
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Reported

686
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Fewer than

687
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
3

688
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
3 or fewer

689
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Like that

690
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
That's a boat

691
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
Tally of discrepancy less than 1000

692
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,344
Well Michigan

693
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,720
Yeah reading over this audit they were discussing that like the really bad

694
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
1

695
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
R1 Fathead / 3

696
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
And that

697
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
You know

698
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:08,704
It leaves you to recognize that these ones that are out of balance aren't out of balance by like 1,000

699
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,496
That would be egregious

700
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
Yeah that would be like National alarms

701
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Yeah yeah it's

702
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,736
Severe when there's three or four

703
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
Piano in a recount and it got caught before anything

704
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
Have any impact on anything

705
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
These are kind of a big

706
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
Sort of election fraud narratives that they got and both are just like the real story I understand

707
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Flies are coming from

708
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
This pain you're putting on but it's

709
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
It's flimsy

710
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
As is this

711
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
Ali is a

712
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Complain about the

713
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
Pennsylvania Supreme Court

714
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision it doesn't matter that there were no Republicans

715
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
It's fine

716
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
That is not

717
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
True well that's

718
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Here's what's going on here

719
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,328
Trump's legal team had argued that their pool Watchers in Pennsylvania we're not allowed to close enough access

720
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,912
The voters Evoque counters excuse me in the Philadelphia

721
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Ocean Center

722
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
Because of many factors perhaps

723
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Most important

724
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Play covid-19 related social distancing

725
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,176
The poll Watchers were kept behind a barrier approximately 15 to 18 ft away from

726
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
On the first row of camp

727
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,272
So the workers would have a safe area too,

728
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,832
Mango is needed to go to the bathroom or whatever

729
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,904
The Trump campaign argued that this was not appropriate

730
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Lower judge

731
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,232
The compromise where they can sit the barrier at

732
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,400
Then Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit claiming that the votes that were counted before the barrier were moved where I they shouldn't

733
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
The Watchers didn't have appropriate access

734
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,848
The matter reached the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the initial distance was appropriate for the requirements of the election

735
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
And to mandate that the disc

736
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Since was too great would be the

737
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
State encroaching on the County's right

738
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Run selection

739
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Through the

740
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Philadelphia County Board of Elections

741
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
I don't sound right

742
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,160
Vacated any previous order and denied the Trump campaign there were

743
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
This is not what a lie is

744
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Report it

745
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:14,144
He's saying that the court decided that it was fine that the Republicans had no poll Watchers which is not at all the issue those before the court

746
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
He's lying about it because it sounds better for his side

747
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,824
Cuz he's a liar employed by Trump's legal team

748
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Included

749
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,664
Including noted weirdo Jenna Ellis who said quote

750
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:31,552
It's inexplicable than five justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would conclude that Watchers observing from distances

751
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
Up to 100 ft away is reasonable

752
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
And then she pulled out her

753
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
Slide whistling

754
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,744
No downward

755
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,632
There's no evidence that this is gate at all in the only reference to 100 ft of the Court decision is quote

756
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
The campaign contends that

757
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Keyboard setup and Posen

758
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
In the barrier

759
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
And having some tables in the area over 100 feet away from the edge of the sea

760
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Security Fence

761
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,968
Effectively deprived it's representative of the ability to be truly present and effectively eliminates the representatives ability

762
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
Perform his or her role in ensuring open this

763
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Transparent

764
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
And the electoral process

765
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,952
That idea only existed a thing of the Trump legal team

766
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Claim but isn't

767
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Substantiate

768
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
I like that the Trump legal team

769
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Could just be like

770
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,704
Yeah we're claiming that 30 Different Drum bombs kill all the Republican in the United States and nobody is talking

771
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,080
Think about that nobody said in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court isn't even going to certify that the election was stolen

772
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
Since all Republicans are dead now

773
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Sure

774
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
If you look at

775
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
The findings of the suit

776
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
You can find out what the max

777
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Strawberries in the Watchers

778
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,368
There was a 15 to 18 ft divided between the Watchers

779
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
The first row

780
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Do tables

781
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,280
A designated area of the convention center was divided into discrete sex

782
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
Each of the various aspects of

783
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Dupree canvassing in campus

784
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Process

785
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
Each section contain three rows of folding tables

786
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
Each table separated by 52

787
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
Even if you assume that like

788
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
Each table takes up sick

789
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,712
Sweet on its own and use the high-end of 18ft for the initial barrier

790
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
You still having it end up only with the distance

791
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
54 ft

792
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
For the barrier to be for this table

793
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
But of course

794
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
And I also people could observe

795
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
From different angles

796
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Anyway my point here is that you can easily see how talking point

797
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Landscape created out of this

798
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,888
For someone like Jenna Ellis she can claim in a suit the people are 100 ft away

799
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,496
And then when the suit gets thrown out you can claim that the court determined the people on her feet away is totally fine

800
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
And that's not nice

801
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Now they can make any claim they were

802
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Now you can

803
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Spin this case

804
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Rightly being reject

805
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
That's for someone like Allie

806
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
No

807
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,832
He doesn't have to worry about things like getting disbarred or anything so use free to just make up anything

808
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah why not

809
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
What he's doing

810
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Great

811
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Google

812
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
There's just no way

813
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,560
I'm a blown away that at no point in time do any of these courts

814
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
It's just be like

815
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
We're holding you in

816
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
In contempt for this dumb argue

817
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
One time

818
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
Copa America

819
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
It's pathetic

820
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,152
Shameful thing to have. I can't imagine being a judge

821
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Reading one of these things and being like

822
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
My job is valuable

823
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
How could you possibly feel

824
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,648
It took two like this bar Larry klayman though

825
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,280
Suspended do anything to avoid telling each other that they're doing a bad job

826
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Plan

827
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
In Georgia

828
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
But Ali is this plan

829
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
I'm going to lay out all right

830
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
He's one of these guys who really like

831
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,872
I think he fancies himself a bond villain sure really likes

832
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
To lay out his plan

833
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Here in Georgia

834
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
High noon at the Georgia state capitol Alex Jones myself another Patriot

835
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,232
These are here and we are Marching and we're telling the Secretary of State

836
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Don't certify the chances of that happening are zero but we might stop the deadline

837
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
24-hours after that and that's what Governor Brian Kemp

838
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
Certify the election from his office

839
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
So

840
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
Various

841
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
The other times.

842
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,416
There's no chance but maybe we won't fail later

843
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,536
Even though it seems like planning to fail from the beginning with suggest that we are going to

844
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Continued

845
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,400
Everyday at noon we're going to be Marching for something that is not going to work

846
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
You have then

847
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Maybe after that

848
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
The governor will do some

849
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
And by the way

850
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Kappa

851
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Did certified

852
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,432
Sucks that also at 0%

853
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:48,832
F****** LARPing pieces at work going

854
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
Guns-blazing

855
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
F****** job you might have to because

856
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Even Ali recognizes hear that

857
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Is Brian Kemp

858
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:06,240
He's certified even Brian Kemp isn't on our team

859
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:12,896
When he signed a piece of paper through find the election they put they Democrats place of electors to the Electoral College

860
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,832
Well that's where we are now

861
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Therapy is lost Georgia

862
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
Move Along Philadelphia or something

863
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Getting in a fight with Grady

864
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Yeah

865
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
These f****** guy

866
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,216
I wonder what the next day will be Alex went to Arizona

867
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
You went to Georgia

868
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,568
This isn't going to work in Georgia now what's next

869
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
What's the next state you going to do another one

870
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
I don't know with the with the weakness of all of these

871
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Legal

872
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Colleges

873
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Lego

874
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
They're not going to get less desperate

875
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
Like these are already incredibly pathetic

876
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
What happens when all of these

877
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,304
They have to do something they have to do something and it's going to be even more desperate than got to be GoDaddy

878
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
You see again or something

879
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Yeah

880
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
Or maybe like a Lexington in

881
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,520
Concorde lie cuz you know how much they love the

882
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,152
Maybe maybe try and recreate that good out of Boston and I'm waiting for them to be like okay

883
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
We're going to have to South Carolina

Be great lake career change for Alex

891
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,616
Living Museum display

892

Giving a little talk over the the footage

00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
Sure he gets

Alex Jones is

00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Right there on the screen

904
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Horning the state

905
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Capitol building in Atlanta Georgia

906
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,880

Electrical

914
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903

Call for new elections

918
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Is in the states that your hero lost

919
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,983
It is really stupid but for the first time in a long time Alex makes sense

920
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
He's back

921
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,103
Opposition role to the rest of reality

922
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Appeals

923
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Yeah

924
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Yeah

925
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
They just they just know they want fashion

926
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:37,183
Your son had to be blunt about it

927
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,255
Election results in Michigan like okay okay

928
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
I got you

929
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
What if we just

930
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
Throw out all black

931
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
How about that does that count would we still have an election there

932
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,727
Good so good

933
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
Alex seems right

934
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Out on the street

935
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
What I'm talking about

936
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
I compare things to wrestling a lot but that's because there's a lot of similarity to the

937
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,343
Distorted reality that exists on Infowars and in the WWE

938
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,951
Did you really basic with things there are good guys and bad guys in wrestling

939
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
The good guy is the face

940
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Bad guys

941
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,119
The ultimate goal of a few days to have the bad guy anger the audience Weatherby B

942
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Cheating and matches Oregon

943
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
Machete personality or whatever

944
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,751
To the point where the audience wants to pay to see the face

945
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Kick his ass

946
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,591
There variations in some middlegrounds but this is the bass

947
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Dynamic

948
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Their character types

949
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
Only work as a heel or a face

950
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
And trying to make them work in an opposite of lineman

951
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Does not

952
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Play

953
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,159
Ithaki Showboat who thinks they're too hot works as a heel but not as if

954
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,511
Because the things that they have to do to play their character are inherently annoying

955
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:51,167
The exceptions Bisbee Shawn Michaels but he was a once-in-a-generation talent rules don't apply to people like a stone-cold to the Undertaker

956
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
We can move on

957
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Similarly

958
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,055
The scrappy try-hard wrestler who refuses to

959
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
Quit does not work as a heel

960
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,151
The audience watching a person take

961
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
The horrible beating and still kicking out of pins

962
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,527
Makes them cheer for the underdog Who Won't Give Up

963
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
The giant there fighting

964
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
Throwing everything they have against them and they just won't stay down

965
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
People love that s***

966
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,255
To the point where it's such a powerful thing that it was used to Turnstone

967
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Coldface

968
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
In his match against Bret Hart WrestleMania 13

969
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
Brett went into that matches the face

970
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
And the two had a brutal

971
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
That resulted in Breton Stone Cold submission hold

972
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
The Sharpshooter

973
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
Stone cold is bleeding profusely from the face and he refused to tap out

974
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
To the Sharpshooter

975
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
With Brett ending up winning

976
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
When Stone Cold

977
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Passed out

978
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
In the hole

979
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
He left an iconic image

980
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,391
And that performance where he refused to give it made it impossible for crowds.

981
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
To cheer for Stone Cold and nuts

982
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
He had to be a fake

983
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:52,607
Consider the previous to this is giving it been that he was a homicidal redneck that was inspired by the emotionless

984
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Serial killer

985
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Richard Kuklinski

986
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Less than a year prior

987
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
He'd broken his former tag team partner Brian pillman's ankle and then was trying to invade his home to

988
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Are you attacking him

989
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
Would you let the pool man pulling out a gun on television to protect itself

990
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
Which was super f***** up and really scare people

991
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Appetite because

992
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Well

993
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,535
The feed cut out right is pillman with pulling his gun

994
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
No it's still cold was rushing into the house

995
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
That's not good

996
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,447
Anyway the point here is that there are characterizations that only working certain

997
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Contacts

998
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
And Alex Jones only works

999
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Outside any connection

1000
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Power

1001
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,127
Everything becomes incoherent once he's trying to make it

1002
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
Excuses for the president who supports but everything is still look

1003
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Conspiracy

1004
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Jessica

1005
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,551
Involve the president in emerado blindly

1006
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Sportsaid president

1007
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,159
It's nonsensical like trying to boo a wrestler was too much heart

1008
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
To give up U2

1009
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
It doesn't make sense

1010
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,303
This I think more than anything else has made me feel substantially better ascend

1011
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
When's the election

1012
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,399
And I wanted to take a moment to address that levity that we probably have them

1013
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
This life couple episodes

1014
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,799
He'll be easy to get the impression that I don't think that Alex has a series of problem anymore

1015
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
Or that I feel like the work is done now that Trump is out of office

1016
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
Make sure no one

1017
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Strongly disagree

1018
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,223
I want to make sure no one thinks that that's where I'm coming from

1019
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
It's my job to watch Alex Jones

1020
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,599
And critique event for a long time he's not made actual sense

1021
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
From the standpoint of what his

1022
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Character is supposed to be

1023
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
Which is infuriating

1024
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
He's supposed to be the only person who can see through the elaborate communist plot to take over the country but he's apparently also supposed to

1025
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
Be the guy that has a president's ear but he's also the guy was mad that

1026
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
The president isn't doing everything he says

1027
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Convoluted

1028
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
The truth-teller Persona needs to be someone who is they

1029
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Signor

1030
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Or is Liz

1031
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,175
Listen to by people who are perennial losers like Ron Paul

1032
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
If you don't do it that way

1033
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Too many unanswerable

1034
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
Has come up that penetrate the

1035
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Passat

1036
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:53,439
I'm grateful to be able to study Alex Jones raspberry words Persona was completely out of sync

1037
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
With the reality

1038
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,047
He's trying to present but I'm also incredibly relieved to re-enter a world where

1039
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
He's back where he belongs

1040
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,679
Time will tell if he's able to pull off the transition back to that place

1041
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Where he gets

1042
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Yellow on the street and everyone

1043
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
El Chapo

1044
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
And stuff

1045
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Tattletale

1046
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,687
I have a hunch there's a lot of money to be made off semi redpilled folks

1047
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
Who find themselves unsatisfied by Fox News but

1048
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Thank you and Aunt

1049
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
I think that Alex could have a

1050
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Brady

1051
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,439
F****** profitable time he's able to thread the needle back

1052
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,583
I can't believe that we're positioned in a place where it seems like all of these right-wing people are just

1053
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Just going to slide back

1054
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Into their

1055
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Positions butt

1056
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
With a we're going to have a higher tolerance

1057
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
You know what I'm saying yeah it could be a situation where some people are going to come out of this more sanitized to Norm

1058
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Reality

1059
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,527
Yeah people like Mitt Romney Barco Rubio might come off with Certo

1060
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,087
I sure she knows

1061
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Sensibility

1062
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
Because they're not saying Trump

1063
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,231
Should

1064
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
I meant

1065
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:05,119
Other people might think there's going to be a drastic reorganization in terms of like

1066
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
MediaFire

1067
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
I think I've

1068
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
I think of that

1069
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,031
I think it's so much radicalization and so much

1070
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
You know

1071
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Nonsense

1072
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Has happened in the last 4 years that

1073
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
I don't

1074
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,271
I don't think most people are going to be satisfied by Fox

1075
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,855
Snooze the audience that they have catered to

1076
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
I think I might have

1077
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
Progressed past

1078
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
The point of what they're able to

1079
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
Yeah they radicalize them beyond the point where they

1080
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:39,167
Control4 satisfy it feels like that's a real possibility could be an amazingly huge

1081
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
Market

1082
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
More people like Alex

1083
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,799
If they're able like I said it

1084
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,895
And I think he wants to I think he would love to cuz he loves money

1085
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
Yeah and also seems to be having just a blast

1086
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Yeah

1087
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
You this is his this is Alex like

1088
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
You know I don't remember

1089
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
How Free Willy end

1090
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
But I imagine that it ends

1091
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,279
With that whale getting to swim in the ocean

1092
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:13,215
2 cm like a universe which is kind of like

1093
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,599
We love you

1094
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
Excited

1095
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
He never gets to hear cheers whenever he's on the

1096
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,239
Michelle do any good just yell catch phrases people get excited

1097
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
I don't want to salute all your

1098
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,463
Alex Jones

1099
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
Aspen lights

1100
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
About everything

1101
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Ahmad Ali

1102
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,447
You don't need a job right now

1103
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
Even Alex doesn't want to hear that

1104
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
Ninety-nine percent of the time

1105
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,335
He says that you don't tell him that

1106
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:27,711
These catchphrases people get really excited and then when he runs out of breath

1107
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,039
He'll have someone like Allie there to tag team the bike with them

1108
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,111
Alex swimming

1109
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
Free in the ocean

1110
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:42,047
It's a little you know I can understand that it's a little bit the difference now between like doing an online comedy show

1111
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
People watching a screen versus

1112
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
He's going into a locked and upset

1113
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
You're not going to get those same laughs man

1114
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
That's the juice that's the way it feels good

1115
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Yeah perhaps

1116
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
What's perhaps

1117
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:01,759
So Nick Fuentes is there that's the downside of that is a huge problem daddy alive comedy

1118
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
I think he's there and he seems like this

1119
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
This dude scary as hell because

1120
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,231
I can kind of see what his program is right now and that is

1121
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:17,887
Earlier he did his thing where you brought like his his groyper movement sure and they started trying to embarrass

1122
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Charlie Kirk

1123
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,727
Turning Point USA at all these

1124
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
Live event

1125
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
I mean

1126
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,567
I don't know I feel like

1127
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,967
1

1128
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
I don't know how how effective

1129
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
Turning Point USA

1130
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,879
And also another point of that is also that like Charlie Kirk

1131
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Just getting older

1132
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
And his hole

1133
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Appeal as a

1134
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
College Ambassador should rephrase maybe a little bit less sensible at this point

1135
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,839
Whatever the case

1136
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,167
I do think that you know he set his sights

1137
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
On demand weather

1138
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,799
He's responsible for them having the waning influence

1139
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,871
He's now I think moving on to the other GOP

1140
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,663
Sure I think that there's a

1141
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,479
Target on like the actual

1142
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Republican

1143
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
Compartir

1144
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
And I know that a lot of people there mentality would be like let him fight

1145
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Stand that

1146
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,951
But also I think if you let them fight

1147
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
You run the risk

1148
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
Of like

1149
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Okay

1150
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,095
Well any games made by people like Nick

1151
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
Yeah make this a even more

1152
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,703
Nazi party

1153
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Anyway he's not happy

1154
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,055
Republican Party

1155
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Spell.

1156
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
We know there was

1157
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Reach Out election day

1158
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
There is no question about it

1159
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
Election day

1160
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,343
We have heard from our Republican rep

1161
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Sedative

1162
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,975
Nikki Haley

1163
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
Cartoon

1164
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
Exact

1165
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
Oregon

1166
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
Feeling this election

1167
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
You have here is more or less

1168
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,359
Getting ready for Biden to win the election

1169
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
And then their focus will turn to

1170
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Interred

1171
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
GOP conference

1172
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,039
Like right this is sort of the model of the

1173
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Booty party

1174
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
Y'all with it where the

1175
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,671
Fringe inside taking over the party

1176
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,975
Seems like there's doing it again but

1177
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,047
Start even more t.i.

1178
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
And great I look forward to that

1179
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
Because this cycle doesn't seem to

1180
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Just repeat itself

1181
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Get worse as it goes a lot

1182
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
It's a testament I think two

1183
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
True level of can

1184
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
Apps that the GOP party

1185
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
Operatives have towards

1186
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,175
Their voters

1187
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Is just like

1188
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
We're going to lie to them

1189
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
Essentially

1190
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
Take them captive to are b*******

1191
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
And then we'll be able to control them forever

1192
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,951
And then we'll leave them sitting ducks

1193
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
To demagogues like these assholes

1194
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,935
To you and you're like no we don't even need to worry about them the mob is

1195
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
So stupid

1196
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
You know Nick Fuentes is going to remain On The Fringe

1197
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
Never going to come in here

1198
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
And in 20 years ago

1199
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Supreme leader Nick Fuentes is going to be great for us

1200
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
I'm worried about Nick Fuentes in the sent that like

1201
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,159
This guy's a real s*** head

1202
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Used

1203
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
Young

1204
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Clearly

1205
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,887
His box has fewer are holes in it than Alex's Alex got rid of all of his plan

1206
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
You know that's

1207
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
But that's what makes him

1208
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
Worrying to me

1209
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:36,287
Though I will say that sometimes he has ideas that just don't make

1210
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
I'm not sure if Nick understands his political

1211
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:55,999
Very well but he should realize that it makes absolutely no sense for him to be calling for a strike of any

1212
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,303
He's either rub paleo

1213
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,911
Conservative or a Libertarian depending on when he's answering the question

1214
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:07,519
Philosophies are super anti-union and super anti-strike

1215
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:13,919
We hate unions and we want every trucker in United 541

1216
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
They're horrible oppressors

1217
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,575
Typically Libertarians reunions is an extortion racket

1218
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,367
Trying to get in the way of the freedom opening

1219
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,439
Employer and employee freely agree to terms

1220
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
Trading money for labor

1221
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,559
They would likely support to workers right to withhold their labor if the

1222
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,119
The terms were unfair but they would definitely

1223
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
And I mean definitely

1224
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:40,799
Be way more passionate about supporting a business's right to replace that worker with someone who would accept unfair terms

1225
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
That's what freedom is about

1226
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,175
After all according to libertarian

1227
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:52,063
Acknowledging that in the face of an overwhelming governing but government entity the only method of

1228
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Fighting

1229
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,719
To unite together at all of us utilize our power to neutralize

1230
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
Is there power

1231
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
And that's what we call

1232
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
Libertarianism

1233
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
Great

1234
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,399
I don't see any possible way for Nick Winchester

1235
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
Coherently call for a trucker strike in order to force

1236
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Trump into office

1237
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,615
If the truckers were to strike over their disapproval that an election Nicks political beliefs that should

1238
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
Require that he support

1239
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Trucking companies

1240
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Breathing in

1241
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,247
Scabs to do the work these truckers refuse

1242
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
It doesn't matter

1243
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,367
Because this isn't the state but that's bad to make political sense

1244
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
Nor is it even something you can pretend would be effect

1245
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
This is a line he's throwing out in hopes of insight

1246
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:36,351
He's trying to pump up the crowd and piping images in their head of their side throwing the country into

1247
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
The chaos with truckers refusing to work unless trumpism

1248
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Installed as president

1249
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Sure is exciting

1250
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
It's exciting

1251
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
So

1252
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
The classic

1253
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
F****** takeover

1254
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,127
Play book though is today to utilize all the

1255
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
The power of

1256
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
The stuff that you hate

1257
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,783
To get yourself into power and then close the door behind you as fast as

1258
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
Could you possibly can so other people can

1259
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
You sure

1260
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Like that's that's

1261
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
How you do it

1262
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:06,047
Yeah that's a gay man out there and it's fun enough but there's also Lowe's

1263
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
Lowe's Owens got to talk

1264
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
I already said something very on

1265
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Surprising

1266
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:14,239
Looking at the crowd here as they begin to March into the building

1267
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,359
People who were on the Caravan with me last week who are still

1268
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
Part of this

1269
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,967
Americans are ready to go

1270
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,527
Not going to let this election be stolen from them

1271
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,111
They're people you recognize when the Caravan cuz you were in Atlanta

1272
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
I don't understand

1273
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,999
They were in the cars the whole way

1274
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,559
People who are info Warrior types

1275
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,631
Atlanta are very likely to come to both of these

1276
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,679
I don't know if they have that

1277
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Rescheduling

1278
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,543
Most of them are unemployed

1279
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
That's not fair

1280
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
Get stuck in a bathtub

1281
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Dominion

1282
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
Conspiracy

1283
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,039
Bad here he believes

1284
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
Just the dumbest version

1285
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
There's no record

1286
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
It can all be done off location

1287
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
It can all be done remotely

1288
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,327
That's why they run with these system that's why they tested it with Hugo Chavez

1289
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,399
In Venezuela and then went at work to steal elections for the

1290
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Communist

1291
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
In Venezuela it with Nationwide

1292
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
You don't think that had some

1293
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
To do with nevermind

1294
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:32,831
For the record Hugo Chavez died in 2013 and won his last election of 2012 so I guess the theory here is it

1295
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,951
This company stole the 2012 Venezuelan election is a test run than eight years later paid it all off

1296
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
With the u.s. election

1297
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,303
It's naturally raises the question of why the globalists didn't

1298
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
Just use it at 26

1299
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,863
16 but we're playing with

1300
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,447
Conspiracy so let's not bring real questions

1301
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,847
Chavez had just died in 2013 they weren't sure if it was going to work down in Pryor

1302
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,687
Have you not read about Internationals and Intergalactic contract law

1303
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,991
So the conspiracy that Owen is spinning

1304
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,807
Is made out of combining details about to differ

1305
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
Print companies in

1306
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
Instead insisting you proving something

1307
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,207
The two companies that issue are dominion and smartmatic

1308
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
At Parkway this

1309
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:16,607
Conspiracies presented as to claim that these are the same company or that Dominion own smartmatic

1310
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
But that's not

1311
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,399
Case they are unrelated

1312
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
Smartmatic is a company that provided Alexa

1313
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,311
Technology in Venezuela but they actually have a history of calling out

1314
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,127
Problems like they did in August 2017

1315
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,967
When they found that the results of the constituent Assembly Election had been altered

1316
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,783
Which they do because their system is tamper-evident

1317
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
Inset to quote self-report

1318
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Any attempt

1319
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Kefir with it

1320
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
Dominion has nothing to do with Venezuela

1321
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Directly

1322
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Competitors

1323
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,447
It's important to remember here that the game of these people are engaging in his not to make a coherent point

1324
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
Their goal is to create a purse

1325
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
Reception where they're right and everyone's out to

1326
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,871
In this case the connection to Cuba Hugo Chavez is really

1327
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Telling

1328
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:05,503
Because it's not about a connection that's real it's about time this whole thing to or right-wing Boogie

1329
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
The anti-communist right wing

1330
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,599
View Hugo Chavez's one of the world

1331
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Greatest evils

1332
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,183
Call the name of this conspiracy is essentially

1333
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,839
I don't know if a.m. service weird right-wingers

1334
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,143
The different left-wing government America's tried to

1335
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Topple over the year

1336
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,263
High profile

1337
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,103
Either figure that most

1338
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,455
Like Fox News Watchers or would be familiar with

1339
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
Idris Elba

1340
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:43,135
So it's almost the perfect person to use as as almost like a

1341
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
The signifier

1342
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
So it's not like he's going to come

1343
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Matcha

1344
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Sure

1345
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,583
I don't know how you would sue anyway but I don't think he was interested

1346
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,351
Ensuing Dan

1347
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
This is where I just kind of lost my

1348
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
My patients without

1349
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,639
The livestream from the capital again in about a half an hour I got Avenue

1350
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,919
Going to get you as well as

1351
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
Video

1352
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,455
Courts

1353
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,247
In the meantime

1354
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
I mean it's just so

1355
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Do I go down

1356
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
Pandemic and everything they're doing

1357
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Torture

1358
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,695
Psychological

1359
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Go torture

1360
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,511
I'm speaking as a producer here

1361
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,839
Infowars is currently in a no-win situation

1362
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,167
You basically have to Main Event players in the entire come

1363
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,447
Company with Alex and Owen

1364
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,007
Owen sucks and all that but compared to rest

1365
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,567
The recipe zeros he's basically Dominique Wilkins

1366
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
Because I was in Atlanta

1367
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,431
They are two roles that currently need to be filled

1368
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,735
What is in studio and what is remote

1369
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,063
And because they're only two people who can reasonably fill those roles

1370
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
They have to do those jobs

1371
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:49,439
With two rolls and two people there are only two possibilities of how to organize things

1372
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
And they're both trash

1373
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
In terms of

1374
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,327
What option is having Alex and studio in Owen on the road

1375
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,703
This is good because Alex is much much better is a broadcaster and he knows how to move the Prada

1376
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,543
And he can say nothing passionately for an hour

1377
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,615
The downside however is that Owen is not a draw

1378
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,943
So you end up with really lackluster disappointing remote event

1379
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,783
Even on his best day Owen can't get a crowd revved up like Alex

1380
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
Alex is old-school on a bullhorn

1381
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
And Alex

1382
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Pretender

1383
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,487
The other option is what we have here where Owen isn't studio and Alex's on the road

1384
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,583
The upshot here is that you probably get more compelling video from the rug

1385
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
Cuz I was probably drunk

1386
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
And he knows how to get People Pumped Up

1387
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
More people are also gone

1388
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
Show up

1389
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
Naturally if Alex Jones is somewhere

1390
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
Compared with Owen Shroyer is there

1391
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
The large crowd you really need out

1392
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,759
At the same time you run into problems with the show itself

1393
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Because I want

1394
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,319
Just not that good at as a house

1395
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
It's so goddamn boring

1396
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
And I can't imagine he's moving

1397
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Any pills

1398
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:56,767
He said something like we'll get back to the feeds of Alex & Allie in half an hour

1399
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,839
And all I can think is wow here comes a shity half hour

1400
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
This is a substitute teacher showing a movie

1401
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,703
You know like is Alex

1402
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
Yeah yelling into a bullhorn

1403
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
And sometimes that movie stop

1404
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,639
And you're like what do we do now that was play heads-up 7Up no

1405
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,967
Let's listen to Owen talk forever

1406
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,575
It's a tough situation if you're in charge of enforcing have to figure out how to assign roles

1407
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,111
But if it were me

1408
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,927
I would never have Alex out of Studio

1409
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
He may draw a bigger crowd

1410
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:32,607
But they're going to be a ton of people in Atlanta no matter what isn't as exciting as Alex

1411
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,679
Combined with Allie Alexander and Nick Fuentes

1412
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
End up not being as poorly attended as

1413
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
The Caravan

1414
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,079
You need Alex in studio for multiple reasons

1415
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383
The first is that he's the only person

1416
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,991
An exciting enough to make this dumb show watchable and that's make people more likely to buy the pills

1417
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,319
There's a financial reality that Alex is better for business

1418
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
As the host

1419
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,207
Then on top of that the whole point of Infowars right now is that shooting super dangerous

1420
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,279
Antifa black lives matter or trying to kill all the

1421
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Conservative

1422
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
Remember a few months ago Alex of the China and MS-13

1423
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
15 duck with the Democrats

1424
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
The takeout conservative talk show hosts

1425
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,727
Legitimately

1426
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
No

1427
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,847
Narrative makes a lot more sense for me to imagine that Alex

1428
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,919
Out-of-control stimuli data

1429
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:23,295
To lean into this whole thing and make the studio feel like Alex's bunker

1430
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
The whole point of his career supposed to be that he's the oracle

1431
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,207
The only person in the world who can see directly through the globalist plan

1432
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:36,351
But literal devil has been trying to enlist him since he was a child because the devil knew that Alex was special and he was a psychic

1433
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,167
If you expect me to believe any of that

1434
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
You have to

1435
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,727
Check that person at all costs

1436
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:48,383
The psychic who's the only person who knows what the globalist are going to do before they do is way too valuable to have out on the street yelling

1437
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,503
Into a bullhorn with a couple of young enterprising bigots that's not the best military tax

1438
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
No

1439
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,135
Now that Infowars become something so comical and Hyper important

1440
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
It's time for them to get right with the script

1441
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,975
Alex is supposed to be this all import

1442
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,023
Guru so you need to start acting like it

1443
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:11,423
The Studio's already established as having guns everywhere and being super well-protected so Alex would only be making appearances

1444
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
From there

1445
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
When is the Young Gun the warrior in the fold

1446
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
So he needs to be Alex's proxy on the streets

1447
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,967
Willing to risk it all because he knows that his muscles and physical former all that he has to give to the infowar

1448
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Astro

1449
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:31,135
I'm going to move on now because I'm getting lost in Flights of Fancy about the ideal directions reinforced to go in the future and again as we touch down at the beginning of the show

1450
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:35,743
We keep coming up with better ideas for them and then they just don't do it I've got you

1451
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:41,631
Beats by mile Harrison

1452
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
Smith is like the

1453
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,751
Smart research guy

1454
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,031
F****** time you're on camera

1455
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,615
You be peeking out from behind a comically large book

1456
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
Really what are we doing here

1457
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,343
Like why not

1458
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,999
Bring Joe Biggs back in and I have him always have grease on him somewhere cuz he's like a mechanic time for something

1459
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
I look like a monk

1460
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,863
He's a monk in there

1461
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,983
Fixing cars turn this into an episode of

1462
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:23,871
That's what I want Danny DeVito should be hired

1463
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:30,271
F****** like nothing that they say is real jet why not make all the characters actual fun characters

1464
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
Christopher Lloyd could be involved

1465
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
Alex

1466
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
I know you're listening

1467
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,927
I don't think you're listening

1468
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
If you're listening

1469
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
I will quit doing this show in order to

1470
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
Produce

1471
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,631
I've got you beat by tomorrow then and it's

1472
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,703
I'll bring you in as a producer

1473
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
It's easy

1474
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
How

1475
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
Can Alex

1476
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
Be in both places at once

1477
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
You ask yourself

1478
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
Why are you wasting money on a f****** tank

1479
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,479
When you could have a hologram

1480
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,575
Yeah that's Harrison Smith comes with you

1481
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,903
What's the little hologram Alex on the floor

1482
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,743
He's got a fake bullhorn he does the whole thing remotely

1483
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
Maybe just a little moonwalk

1484
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:20,447
I assume that they're going to mix the Michael Jackson hologram with his to look a little bit but with a record you still need a record

1485
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:27,359
Is time would still be strained that way for a while

1486
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,711
IBEW.

1487
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,527
About the 8th Friday

1488
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:39,135
SoJO Spa

1489
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
I could see it

1490
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:49,375
Yeah I just think that there's intrinsic problems with people in the roles that they're in like they can do specific

1491
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
6 things

1492
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,703
To a certain level of competence

1493
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,031
And unfortunately Alex can do multiple things

1494
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,335
But the other people he had

1495
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
Can't

1496
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,383
Right

1497
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
And the only way to really like

1498
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
To maximize everybody

1499
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Skill sets

1500
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
Is to have them all start playing

1501
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,879
In order for this to Feel-Rite Alex can never be out of

1502
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Studio

1503
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:18,047
I know that he wants to be and it is like I said is Free Willy natural environment to be up there yelling into a bullhorn

1504
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
But that's not his

1505
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Is Play sign

1506
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:25,471
I mean it's it is a little bit though that none of them really understand

1507
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,519
Who they are because they all fit

1508
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Think that they're way better than who they are

1509
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,455
You know like a reviewer associate

1510
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Is Lance Stephenson

1511
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
They think

1512
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
That they're f****** Kevin Durant

1513
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,367
You're still late

1514
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
San okay

1515
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
You're going to blow

1516
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,487
In LeBron's ear that's your job that's all you've got

1517
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,023
You're not going to score 20 and night

1518
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
It's just not going to happen

1519
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Batman

1520
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,351
You're a dick

1521
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
Play your role

1522
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,471
It would be better I think for everybody

1523
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
If they did play their roles

1524
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,311
Totally

1525
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
And

1526
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,127
Thought it would be more funny

1527
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Play for me too

1528
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
If everybody put it in that goes back

1529
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,295
Everybody would have to have a base level of comp

1530
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
What's that just simply does

1531
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,159
Will it in Toto

1532
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,951
Could if they focus

1533
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,815
Everybody requires a base level of focus.

1534
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,375
The reason that Owen probably hasn't gotten

1535
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:31,007
Better at going out doing these Road thing is because he also has to do the Wardrobe

1536
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,079
Yes do this against where these multiple hat

1537
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
Obviously

1538
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,663
If he spent all his time Focus

1539
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
Sing on

1540
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Alright

1541
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
How do we manipulate crowds

1542
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
To the best of our belly

1543
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,343
Is that shots work best in

1544
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
Winfield pieces

1545
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,695
He really studied his craft and really tried to hone that

1546
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,279
He could be an amazing tool for Alex to use

1547
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
While Alex is

1548
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,607
The guru in studio

1549
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
Doing what he does

1550
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,703
If you had other employees

1551
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
That he had just work

1552
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
In specific areas

1553
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
To be like

1554
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,591
You are the person that I need

1555
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,175
To cover text yet cuz I don't understand text stuff right

1556
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
You Harris

1557
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,247
If you have glasses you look like a dweeb

1558
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,527
We need you to do that

1559
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:20,927
Step into it to do with like Mike Adams whenever there's a health storywood

1560
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Ranger

1561
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,535
You know this could be the reliable voice on that front

1562
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,815
He needs that

1563
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,351
He needs the people who fit

1564
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,911
Cool are the tools

1565
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,959
For the jobs that need to be done

1566
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
Yeah but that would require Alec

1567
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:38,335
What's to have any interest in in-house Talent Development which is

1568
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
It seems he

1569
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:44,991
Has strenuously avoided because I think he's trying to go for these cheap

1570
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
Pops

1571
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:49,599
Alexander Nix

1572
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
Like all right you're trying

1573
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,927
To capitalize on whatever audience

1574
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
They already have

1575
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,023
They're also using you

1576
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,351
And it's not going to work out in any kind of long-run

1577
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,399
Yeah it's it's

1578
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:06,239
It's a bad strategy to keep giving him advice but yeah

1579
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
You need to develop some Talent

1580
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:13,919
It's too late probably has anybody he's had on camera in our entire time. Improve

1581
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:20,831
Do you know what I'm saying like in terms of Isaac super greed

1582
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,903
I mean other than other than a more increase

1583
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
I suppose

1584
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
Professionalism as opposed to be in like

1585
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,119
Although at the same time he was like bucket and hammer and sickle or not

1586
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,191
But I've been okay baby Millie Weaver but that's also

1587
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,311
Just because the first time we saw her she was rainbow snatch and that's top

1588
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
Yeah I know I don't think

1589
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,151
There's a lot of proficiency in

1590
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
Skill development going on

1591
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
Add Infowars

1592
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
Here's what I would say

1593
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
Is one of the main problem

1594
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:58,975
It's such a singular Alex Jones focused world that you have people like

1595
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Owen

1596
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,535
Trying to host the show

1597
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,351
And he's clearly trying to be Alex

1598
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
I feel that

1599
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
You got Democrats you know

1600
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
I try not to yell

1601
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Screaming get f*****

1602
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,175
Democrats are the most disingenuous

1603
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
I've ever seen

1604
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,807
And it's just so sad

1605
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:30,463
That's just a bad Alex impression no kid one of his fake breakdowns with long pauses for dramatic effect

1606
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
He's just doing the exact same thing that Alex does but

1607
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,071
Come so far

1608
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,911
Yeah it let way less believable

1609
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,471
Needs to find his own lane his own voice

1610
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,287
Like a comic doing someone else's delivery

1611
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Basically

1612
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,871
Tragic because

1613
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
You have stuff like that

1614
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
And that just Falls

1615
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
F****** flat

1616
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
It goes to commercial

1617
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:59,391
And Alex is back and he's doing s*** like this in your like Holy Chic you're running circles around people

1618
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,767
Do you think something that flip over

1619
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,327
Brian stelter

1620
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,359
Working what are you going to do

1621
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
What's everybody's

1622
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:27,807
F****** dirigibles at Mama's watching everything whatever

1623
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,087
You cut the Alexander

1624
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,487
Disingenuous

1625
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:42,911
God is in the blip shitted on all of his right now I mean what do you do with it like

1626
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:50,591
Is like watching Michael Jordan.

1627
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,663
Sit out here not your Horace Grant you're not even

1628
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,479
Get the f*** out of here

1629
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,759
Like kind of

1630
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:04,159
Like I mean Alex is wrong and he's a monster but there is a part of me that like if he's frustrated with his staff

1631
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
I get it

1632
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
They're not good

1633
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,303
He can do all of these things better than them

1634
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:16,703
Hippie should be able to

1635
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
16

1636
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,591
It makes sense that he would be better but it's embarrassing the level is better

1637
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,175
It is and he's doing a really bad job of fostering

1638
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,759
The mentoring diabetic terms of

1639
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,783
Whatever skills

1640
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,807
They have

1641
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Not being a size

1642
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,927
He told me it was created by the fact that I wanted

1643
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,207
Just doing at Alex and pressure

1644
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,071
Well I mean it's it's like a it's like Trump and his whole Administration

1645
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Enchanted psychic

1646
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
I just

1647
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,703
You bear the responsibility

1648
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
For hiring

1649
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
You do

1650
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,055
That's part of your job

1651
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,663
Yeah that's the administrative responsibilities

1652
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
Not improving them or even seemingly attempted

1653
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:06,879
Performance reviews in a lot of normal work environment

1654
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
Buck stops there

1655
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
In terms of

1656
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,791
Pretending this is a chaotic environment

1657
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
It's just

1658
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
Just perform

1659
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
Alex's

1660
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Just running circle

1661
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
Just ate

1662
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
Almost outrageous

1663
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
Watching this episode

1664
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
The diff

1665
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
But you see

1666
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
I want to give a round of applause

1667
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,855
Remix Brian stelter is stalking a balloon

1668
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
That's really funny

1669
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,439
Not as good as a Dalek with a gun butt

1670
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:47,839
No it's still good huh I do like the image though because I knock Euler

1671
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,935
I see like the the Hindenburg level where it's a giant

1672
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
When he's down in music

1673
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,751
You f****** he's got a ships

1674
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
Captain

1675
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:03,199
Doing that whole thing looking out the window just leaning down to the like that motherfuker again he's bought the Hat

1676
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:08,063
Alex wore on Halloween

1677
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,135
Play Flight of the Valkyries while

1678
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,183
Beside one of those

1679
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
A sextant

1680
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:16,767
I don't know

1681
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,327
Well as we all do

1682
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Bread shelter only David

1683
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,703
I mean like Alex is coming in with this

1684
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,727
Like just

1685
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
Dunking on ons

1686
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,055
Brian stelter stalking me

1687
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
And then

1688
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Like

1689
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,431
He's so good at this that he's even doing commercials

1690
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:38,015
From the road from god dammit

1691
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
Georgia

1692
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Guidestone

1693
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
Covering all this

1694
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Trying to stop

1695
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,119
Cover all this

1696
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,703
Is your financial support

1697
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,287
T-shirt books

1698
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Film

1699
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,895
Are these are the highest quality High

1700
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,967
I really feel it

1701
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,831
He just goes into a net

1702
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,463
It's remarkable he even recognizes that probably Owens not doing a good enough job of pushing

1703
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
Sing the product selling

1704
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,535
Selling things to keep things afloat

1705
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
So he knows that it's his job to not only

1706
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,935
Go out there to draw a crowd to make the optic

1707
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Fix that they need

1708
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,519
To push this argument that the people are demanding

1709
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
Georgia flip

1710
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,639
But he also needs to get on air and

1711
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,663
Add pivot

1712
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
To try and sell Palisade

1713
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
It's

1714
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:47,391
The weight of the weight of the Infowars is squarely on his shoulders I really don't understand

1715
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
See that's the other thing that I do

1716
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,743
How is Owen not-self inbred like

1717
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,071
Just do you think he watches clips

1718
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,143
Like what I was doing stand-up

1719
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,727
Do you know I would listen to my sets over and over I would watch myself

1720
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,287
Doucette's and I would critique my performance

1721
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,335
You know he doesn't do any of that s***

1722
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,127
Like what's the incentive

1723
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Exactly

1724
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,943
I just I have

1725
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
Good at your job I feel like that's a good

1726
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,271
Incentive

1727
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,319
I feel like I'm going to probably make a

1728
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,135
A pretty decent argument that he's as good as he needs to be

1729
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:24,511
He hasn't show on Infowars the top of the

1730
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
Commercial

1731
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,351
Conspiracy b*******

1732
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
World like

1733
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,959
In terms of that media sure it's a job

1734
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,495
I'm get paid

1735
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
You're on

1736
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,567
Infowars about

1737
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,383
But that's like somebody saying like a man

1738
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:46,015
I have always dreamt of playing Triple-A ball and I made it and now I'm done

1739
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:50,367
Why don't you want to don't you want to get to the show man come on

1740
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,183
But the dark reality is for him this is the show

1741
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
That's true

1742
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
That is a

1743
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
Cuz they like

1744
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
For us we're looking at it so

1745
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,399
You can work for a real outlet that would be like the equivalent to

1746
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
The majors

1747
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,191
But that's

1748
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
That's not the way he looks at

1749
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,543
Astro got the way the people in this room look at it

1750
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:12,639
The only place to go up would maybe be Breitbart

1751
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:18,783
Probably not even work for drugs but drugs is out-of-pocket now they can't do that

1752
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,599
Play Anna maybe but that's kind of a lateral

1753
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Probably not

1754
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
Their hosts are boring but in the

1755
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,767
Different way they might want Owen but not Alex

1756
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:32,351
Rebel media but then again that's another lateral though

1757
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
Is about is bad

1758
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,471
That's at the top of the mountain

1759
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,287
That's really really really sad

1760
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
Bunk'd

1761
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Yeah

1762
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
I can't wait to have him

1763
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:50,015
And to your question about like why doesn't Owen get better

1764
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,343
One of the issues is whatever you accept becomes except

1765
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:58,207
And if you can get away with just doing this

1766
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,255
Why not always do this

1767
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,375
I still sometimes like wake up in the middle of the night and I'm

1768
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
Thinking about

1769
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
It's that I've got

1770
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
I've been like how can I improve those

1771
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,519
I'm probably never going to do stand up again

1772
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
There are stories

1773
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
All across the nation

1774
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,872
Including where I found this story today

1775
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,920
Deep-diving this where the headline is

1776
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,736
Black lady Goodwill Ambassador

1777
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
Who hates white people with the headline

1778
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
Should White Boys still be allowed to talk

1779
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
That's in the

1780
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
Dixon Dixon

1781
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
Dicksonia

1782
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
Addiction College

1783
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
In Pennsylvania

1784
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,024
Route to be racist against white people

1785
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,608
Oh and did on this

1786
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,728
This essay that Owen Sound

1787
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Today

1788
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
Baby student newspaper at Dickens

1789
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
Colleges with enrollment

1790
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,248
Just over 2,400

1791
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:59,136
It was written by a guest writer and it's obviously making the point that conversation and classes in the writers

1792
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,696
Experience are dominated by white male voice

1793
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
From yesterday

1794
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:07,840
Quote in my time at Dickinson I've listen to probably hundreds of white boys talk

1795
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
It feels incessant

1796
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:13,984
From classes and lectures to the news and politics there's an endless line of white boys

1797
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
Wait to share their opinions on the

1798
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
The state of feminism in America

1799
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:21,152
What does lgbtq plus population finally has an upright

1800
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,944
The merits of capitalism Etc

1801
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,528
The list of what white boys think they're qualified to talk about his endless

1802
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,416
Something very few of them seem to understand is that informed uncritical opinions do not constitute

1803
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Truth

1804
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
It's kind of funny actually because the essay itself

1805
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,864
Explains why Owen being offended by this essay is nonsense

1806
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:47,008
The second thing most white boys seem not to understand is that they do not exist separate from the rest of the world

1807
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,288
You do not speak alone

1808
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:52,640
You speak with the weight of every other white man who is spoken over a woman erased

1809
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,200
Contributions of queer people from history

1810
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,480
Or denigrated broken

1811
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
English's

1812
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,600
Know know when a black person does something all black people response

1813
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:07,744
As we all know a white person is an individual and cannot be held against

1814
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,584
Policies and laws meant to forever to find intelligence by how it measures

1815
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
Is up to the Bros of America

1816
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,984
As was made clear in the final paragraph of this essay this is about Black History Month

1817
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,520
And how the writer doesn't approve of

1818
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Overvaluing

1819
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Particularly

1820
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,616
22 the exclusion

1821
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
Other quote

1822
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
Buried or ignored voice

1823
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,248
Speaking as a white boy I don't take any offense

1824
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,272
At this perspective

1825
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:36,928
The style of writing seems to me very intentionally to be confrontational because it's an opinion piece about how her perspective and

1826
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:40,000
Her being relegated as being less important than others

1827
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
The rhetorically at work

1828
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
For the writing to be kind of brush

1829
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,120
Stylistically sensible

1830
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,936
Now that's somebody with a partner who teaches High School believe me

1831
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,960
Boys talked

1832
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,544
I don't I don't

1833
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,104
Think like obviously this isn't

1834
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,896
This person making the argument

1835
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Did white people

1836
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
Should never be able to

1837
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
The Talk

1838
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
It's just that it's

1839
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,760
The perspective of

1840
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Of

1841
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,856
All this conversation on campus seems so much

1842
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,952
About issues that are unrelated to their experience

1843
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
To seem to

1844
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Take priority of president

1845
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
About the other thing

1846
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
I would say

1847
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,096
Is that the

1848
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Headline of this

1849
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
He's

1850
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,680
Should white boys be allowed to

1851
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,984
To talk and I know from my time

1852
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,800
What I used to write for my campus paper

1853
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Generally

1854
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,360
Editor's right the head

1855
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,920
This person who wrote this article

1856
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,712
Probably didn't write that

1857
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
And she's being

1858
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,576
Lambasted

1859
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,136
The headline is more extreme than the actual

1860
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
Article

1861
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:47,072
I am trying to get more than you would make an extreme headline so people would grab them

1862
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,864
Yeah yeah yeah

1863
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,472
I don't know it so it's a willful misunderstanding of

1864
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,288
The point that was being made in this student newspaper

1865
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,664
Media did a cycle with this back in 2019 they already did that

1866
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,224
Yearly thing

1867
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,760
41 months

1868
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:10,368
It wasn't last year who said it wasn't

1869
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,976
It speaks volumes that Owen Shroyer decided to spend time on the show complaining about this

1870
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
College Newspaper opinion

1871
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,072
A form over a year-and-a-half ago

1872
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,376
Cuz he wants to whine about how bad it is

1873
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,960
Tough it's tough to be white just very sad

1874
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,984
Just want to throw things

1875
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,008
It's very

1876
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
It's

1877
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
It's remarkable

1878
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,360
That length needs

1879
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,128
To be gone to

1880
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
Wood art

1881
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
I bet the person who is

1882
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,016
Furious

1883
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
About

1884
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,112
An op-ed piece in the student newspaper

1885
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
That is

1886
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,208
Thousands of miles away

1887
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
Is the saddest

1888
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,024
Very sad

1889
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,304
Now we go back

1890
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
Alex

1891
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Out there bullhorn

1892
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
He's changed

1893
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
Sure there's some stop the steel chance I'm going to do any Locker Outsider like lock her up never know I don't think there's any Locker ups that I heard

1894
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,104
There's definitely some USA

1895
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,896
If you agree

1896
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
And then we get another surprise

1897
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
Guest appearance

1898
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,808
Let's go back to the state capitol in Atlanta he's outside now

1899
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,344
With a big crowd bullhorn

1900
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,024
Special session now

1901
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
Enrique tarrio inter

1902
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,688
The picture

1903
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
With Alex and

1904
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,784
Nick Fuentes

1905
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,344
Real

1906
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,648
Is the Washington generals

1907
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
Conservative propagate

1908
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,560
But so Alex is out there he's got this special session now champ going

1909
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,840
And I've been pretty

1910
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
Miano

1911
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,680
A few sevigne my praise

1912
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:03,520
For Alex out on the street and his ability to rile up a crowd

1913
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,592
But here is the point where I have to point out that he is only

1914
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,896
I need to not get any chance

1915
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,736
Because things fizzle out a little bit

1916
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,784
And so it goes back to him

1917
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
And a little bit of a different

1918
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,392
Let's go back live now Alex Jones on the

1919
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
EPA

1920
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Who

1921
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,872
Do you think he's trying to

1922
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,664
I think he was

1923
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,712
A long thing to chance

1924
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:47,808
Well yeah yeah no it's not

1925
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
Did I think he was

1926
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,160
IPad

1927
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Like this Thursday

1928
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
Did it's flat

1929
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,512
Anymore

1930
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,560
The rally is

1931
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
Is over

1932
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
It's true

1933
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
Owen wants to make an analogy here you sit

1934
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,800
Nice talking about these global

1935
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:10,848
I don't like Bully

1936
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
Steal your lunch

1937
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
All right right

1938
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,224
But they don't want you to talk about how they're bullying them because then people

1939
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
Their analogies RC

1940
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
Analogy

1941
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
I try to make an allergy

1942
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
You try

1943
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
Can understand

1944
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Understand what I'm saying

1945
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,888
I get it just in my head this makes sense or is this

1946
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,168
Translating on air

1947
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,240
If you're in the

1948
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,568
High School

1949
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,848
Lunch room

1950
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,176
And there's a guy going around

1951
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Feeling everybody

1952
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,320
This is weird

1953
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,880
And then you're like hey

1954
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
Steve over there

1955
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,280
Has been going around stealing everybody's lunch money

1956
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,816
I got to pause it real quick

1957
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
Because

1958
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
I didn't realize

1959
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,168
The first time I listened through this

1960
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:11,008
That he's imagining a scenario where this guy is stealthily

1961
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,568
Steel

1962
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,640
This is a high school Tik-Tok

1963
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,480
High school bully cat burglar

1964
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,904
Me

1965
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
That can lead to violence against me

1966
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,232
Well hold on a second

1967
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,352
Back to the globalists are

1968
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,632
That's the Democrats are

1969
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,912
That's the mainstream media

1970
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,520
They stole in your country they stolen your integrity

1971
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
They stolen your reality they stolen

1972
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Everything

1973
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:52,736
They stolen your future they stolen your children's future they stolen our education system

1974
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
They have taken

1975
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,600
Everything except the very breath

1976
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
4 miles

1977
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,440
And now they're coming for that too with a stupid

1978
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,328
And so you just pulled that keep the breath in your mouth

1979
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,864
You committed these crimes

1980
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,912
You committed these atrocities

1981
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,728
You're trying to make us a slave you were lying to us

1982
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
You are dividing us

1983
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:22,176
Doing it

1984
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,504
You know what you deserve what's coming

1985
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,064
Waiting for it

1986
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
That's why they're so scared

1987
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,208
Did you really think we wouldn't hate this on our fans

1988
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,584
You really thought you could control the moms

1989
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
No

1990
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
No

1991
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,312
That analogy that Owen used is not great but I think I get

1992
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
The point

1993
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,664
I want understands but his position in life and his career is to be a stochastic

1994
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Terrorist

1995
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:58,272
And work really hard to inspire people to enact violence on his enemies

1996
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,576
But he doesn't feel like he's wrong to do that

1997
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,136
Because he's decided that is animes deserve it

1998
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
Is imagined

1999
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,696
That's not surprising

2000
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:10,048
Here and honestly the thing the kind of runs underneath a lot of Infowars programming

2001
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,144
But it's weird here Owen be so blunt about those feelings of wanting Bob viola

2002
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,936
Yeah seems like a bad move

2003
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:22,336
You guys stole everything and I want everybody to solve this problem and you deserve violence

2004
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
I think we all know how it went

2005
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:28,736
It seems like a really bad move particularly because we've done this enough times to know that

2006
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,320
Should anything happen they'll call it a false flag

2007
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Also

2008
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,160
It's almost impressive to me how much of that rant felt

2009
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,696
Four star so bad

2010
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,280
Ocean felt ungenuine but in a completely different way than

2011
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,816
The falseness of Alex's outbursts

2012
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
Alex's way over the

2013
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
The top growling

2014
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,448
Fake crying almost like a clowns take on

2015
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Performing an emotion

2016
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,264
When Owen gets rolling

2017
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,568
It feels way too much like he's thinking in his head

2018
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,360
Alright now it's time to get intense

2019
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,432
You could almost hear him trying to figure out what to talk about next

2020
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,736
It's a really boring version of in

2021
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,016
Sincerity and I just don't

2022
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:06,368
Enjoy it that much as a style

2023
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,672
I'm sorry to say this but his voice

2024
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
Gets real whiny

2025
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,256
Emma in the higher pitches he cracked

2026
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,304
Texas voice gets real whiny and so his

2027
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
He's in

2028
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:19,168
Just doesn't sell it

2029
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,752
I try not to be too critical on those kinds of

2030
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,312
The fronts because I think the postman with a gold

2031
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Open Voice

2032
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,664
Yeah but I also have you know.

2033
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
Types

2034
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,248
Emoting that I can do wear my voice

2035
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,552
To folks as well

2036
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,112
People don't hang out at

2037
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,416
People don't have as much

2038
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,696
Control over like

2039
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,280
Tonal qualities of their voices they want

2040
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,912
Understanding on that front

2041
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
I mean

2042
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Just bored terms of be like

2043
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,520
The things that are very easily

2044
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,544
Controllable

2045
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,872
You would think after four years you get a little bit better at fake

2046
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:00,640
Getting an emotion

2047
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,944
If your job is basically to

2048
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Create

2049
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,992
And present emoji

2050
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:10,112
But I mean if your job though as you see it is really just to do an Alex impression

2051
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,392
You know that's

2052
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
The problem

2053
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,768
Fanfiction

2054
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
About Trump

2055
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,840
He's up to while he's hiding

2056
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Sure I just listened to this clip

2057
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,008
Ask yourself how is this any different than what people online do with qanon

2058
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,312
But you know what I think

2059
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,384
What President Trump is doing right now is he's giving these people

2060
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
The one last year

2061
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,224
What he may have even given them

2062
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,016
And just said you know what

2063
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,648
I'm going to go away I'm going to be

2064
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,416
Quiet

2065
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
And you guys can

2066
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
I can see this election

2067
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,352
And

2068
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,400
You can stop lying to the American people

2069
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:02,080
And you can stop making deals with the Communist Chinese and stopped working for the UN in the World Health Organization

2070
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,896
And let me be president

2071
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:09,760
Or you can continue to take off the Americans

2072
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
You can continue to

2073
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,832
Take off the Republic

2074
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,184
And all unleash this Beast

2075
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,976
Island least it's cracking I'll let

2076
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,256
This lion roar

2077
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,304
And you can deal with that step

2078
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
Cuz that's where this is going

2079
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,288
Yeah it's a million Marchers in DC peacefully now

2080
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Yeah but

2081
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,640
It's going to be thousands of people peacefully in Atlanta this weekend but let me

2082
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Me tell you

2083
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:41,504
If you steal this election from us and you put in a u n

2084
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
Communist

2085
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,904
Corrupt criminal Joe Biden the White House it's not going to be a million piece will

2086
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
Marchers in d.c.

2087
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:57,632
Okay okay so if I'm is inaugurated we will kill

2088
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:04,032
Fictitious imaginary scenario where Trump has given a deadline

2089
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,824
For the globalist

2090
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
Step back.

2091
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,128
And stop pissing off the

2092
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:12,480
The Patriots

2093
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
Good guy

2094
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
You have to give him that chance

2095
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,832
To do the right

2096
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Thing

2097
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,160
Oh this is where this idea

2098
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,256
Bedouin is just creating out of his own

2099
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,280
Stuff to do

2100
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,304
Hey

2101
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Interesting

2102
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,632
Thought because tails

2103
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,936
In this next

2104
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,496
Trump

2105
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,288
And of course they're not

2106
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,872
But she just like they have to have that

2107
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,896
Metaphysical

2108
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
Comfort

2109
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,736
Just like they have to have that

2110
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,016
Metaphysical comfort of

2111
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,344
You accepting the Matthew accepting the vaccine

2112
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,512
You accepting the Tyranny you inviting The Tyranny that gives them the metaphysical comfort knowing they didn't force it on you you accept

2113
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Trump

2114
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,144
We have to have the same metaphysical

2115
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,680
Comfort knowing that we

2116
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,752
One last chance

2117
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
DebtStoppers

2118
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,592
Stop with the enslavement of mankind

2119
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:13,664
Stop with the lies that you're telling mankind

2120
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,200
Stop.

2121
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:19,040
You can stop at all right now the censorship you're coming after all of us

2122
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
And they won't do it

2123
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,136
Even given the metaphysical opportunity now

2124
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,464
Will be no excuses

2125
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:27,744
Okay this is problem

2126
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,352
Look for me on a couple levels

2127
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
The preemptive justification

2128
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
Asian / murder

2129
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:41,056
Owen is telling the audience that wants Biden is president that means the audience's enemies have turned down this imaginary last

2130
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,592
Chance the Trump is offering them

2131
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
To give up their Wicked Ways

2132
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
Can we talk to

2133
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,968
To eat your neighbor but take comfort in the fact they deserve it

2134
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:53,088
Cuz Trump

2135
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
The function of the

2136
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:58,720
Yep the second issue I have is with Owens understanding of Alex's bizarre moral system

2137
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,280
Owen seems to think that it's about the globalist

2138
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
Leading the field

2139
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,584
Comfortable that they gave you a choice

2140
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,632
But that's not what Alex believes

2141
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:12,288
Alex believes there are literal Cosmic laws that even the devil cannot break that involve you not being able to act count

2142
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,824
I heard someone else's free will

2143
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,360
It's not that it's a comfort

2144
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,432
To know you didn't force people to do something it's a belief system

2145
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504
Karma coming if you do

2146
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,272
Chestatee

2147
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
I worry that Alex

2148
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,088
Mainata Feliz

2149
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,648
Explain this whole system of how the cosmos work to Owen

2150
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,696
Which is troubling

2151
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:36,352
I get the sense that maybe what happened is that Alex got pretty drunk couple times and ramble did Owen about their sin

2152
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,936
Elizabeth Comfort not be

2153
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:44,544
The immutable laws of the universe

2154
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
Why are you

2155
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,408
Saying that you have to do the same thing as the Clone Wars

2156
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
We'll see

2157
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:56,576
Shouldn't you be like we don't have to do the globalist cuz we're not going was if you're saying we have to do the same thing as the globalist

2158
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,904
You're actually Global it's not the same thing it just has sort of

2159
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Similarities

2160
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,744
Like The Witcher

2161
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,768
Globalist

2162
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
Vert

2163
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Bear Lake

2164
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,840
They have to

2165
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,632
To trick you into doing something

2166
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,400
That's

2167
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Deceitful

2168
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,960
Trump this is straight-up

2169
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,008
Cuz this isn't being like

2170
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Hey

2171
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
Everybody knows everything

2172
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
This is your last check

2173
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
No he wouldn't

2174
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,384
Be straight up if you sent that

2175
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:26,784
He's doing these weird legal challenges to the globalist behind the scene

2176
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,808
Oh okay

2177
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:31,392
According to Owens imagination

2178
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,768
Do you have a better chance you heard Owen

2179
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,424
I did have you heard I would imagine this thing I apparently times to get it

2180
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,728
I had my absolute acquiescence I guess

2181
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:51,360
I think that this also highlights the other thing where Owen is doing a bad Alex impression like

2182
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,944
Totally his version of Alex's stupid moral system isn't

2183
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,248
Even more stupid and less

2184
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,296
It's not interesting where is Malik

2185
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,856
It seems like it's based on some kind of

2186
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,392
Real f*****-up yeah

2187
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,928
Belief system

2188
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:08,512
I'm interested in unravel I'm not interested

2189
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,048
Listening to Owen

2190
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,352
Community

2191
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,144
That nonsensical

2192
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,240
Of course. He doesn't share it and I don't think he actually understand what Alex

2193
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:21,056
Just trying to convey

2194
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,360
But he is doing an hour to

2195
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,920
Suppression and apparently

2196
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,456
Mythology that

2197
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,992
Nanavaty feels like he needs

2198
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,272
Also included

2199
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
It's just

2200
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,832
Black tap

2201
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,392
I was about ready to say f*** all this

2202
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,416
But

2203
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Every time

2204
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
I think I'm out

2205
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
He pulls me back

2206
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
Coming up in the next

2207
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
Segment

2208
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,144
We're going to be joined by Alex Jones and

2209
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,704
Nick Fuentes

2210
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:53,568
And apparently Alex has a big announcement that he is going to be making

2211
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,152
And he really wants me to emphasize that so Alex is coming up

2212
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,944
Huge announcement

2213
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Segment

2214
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:06,112
I am not positive there is a huge announcement but when I hear that

2215
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:09,440
That would be cool if he was like going to sacrifice Nick Fuentes 2

2216
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,976
Did Trump in like eat his heart

2217
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,280
Who's in public Alex has

2218
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,656
Inclinations towards cannibalism

2219
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:23,264
Alex eviscerated Nick Fuentes 1/8 his heart live on air

2220
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,312
The only thing that I think is kind of

2221
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:29,920
Live close to like maybe this is his huge announcement I don't know if I've heard

2222
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
Birmingham before

2223
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
Was he does

2224
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:39,392
Say that the austro-hungarian empire did nothing wrong in the lead-up to World War 1

2225
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:45,792
Issue for me it is about today

2226
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,144
Cuz I don't think that and I got confused

2227
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:58,080
Straight Talk

2228
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,104
Braids on it

2229
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,896
He said it's all the British

2230
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,456
Sure that sounds right

2231
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,480
Anyway

2232
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,528
That's not his announcement

2233
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,808
It could have been

2234
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,600
Maybe it's that Nick Fuentes

2235
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
The speech of the day

2236
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,184
Best speech out there it in Atlanta

2237
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
And I'm like I said he's

2238
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,792
Just hits for 25 minutes but you hit

2239
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,400
In the right direction and that is. Who are backing up drop

2240
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,168
Again

2241
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
Is

2242
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
The guy who has a

2243
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,776
The project is Project now seems to be focused

2244
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,848
On being anti-gop

2245
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,152
McConnell has said nothing

2246
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,688
Nikki Haley said nothing

2247
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
Print Shop Madison cawthorn

2248
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,552
All the people hailed as the future of the GOP

2249
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
Have remain silent

2250
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
Well

2251
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
People like myself

2252
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Open Alex

2253
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,928
Patriots like you coming out

2254
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,952
State capitals

2255
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
A doing all the work

2256
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
And fighting for this

2257
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,072
Take the fight to them no matter what happens

2258
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
And let's be clear

2259
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
We know

2260
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,448
China Joe's

2261
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
The robot

2262
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,568
When you got

2263
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,360
Marco Rubio

2264
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:05,920
A pirate

2265
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,688
Crenshaw

2266
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Aldi's

2267
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
Only fake pee

2268
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,016
Julie Mall

2269
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
Call Dish

2270
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,064
They are literally worse

2271
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,088
The man the enemy

2272
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
Because they act like

2273
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Like they're with us

2274
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
When they're really

2275
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Established

2276
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,000
I mean it seems like this is the direction

2277
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:25,632
That they will probably want to go next their targets

2278
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:30,240
Like obviously you can always keep Soros and all that s*** in the back burner

2279
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,264
But

2280
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,080
Ineffective cowardly

2281
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:38,432
Republicans in name only can be the new

2282
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:41,248
Sue didn't support Trump in his hour of need

2283
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
What guys

2284
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,832
I agree with you they were lying to you the whole time

2285
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
But in a different way than what you think

2286
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,184
Relying differently than you

2287
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,280
Like it would almost I wondered sometimes I wonder like what would happen if

2288
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,048
The murdochs

2289
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Just like

2290
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,352
One day we're like hey

2291
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,680
We don't want everybody to be

2292
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
So

2293
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
We're just going to announce

2294
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,312
Fox News has been lying to you this whole f****** time

2295
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,848
It was alright DIA

2296
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,128
We wanted to get you guys

2297
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
To do the b******* that we wanted to

2298
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Now

2299
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,968
We don't want you to K-Love

2300
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:19,648
Someone would find some investor in new score

2301
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:23,232
Conspiracy

2302
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,352
I think that Alex is really into this too and I think

2303
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:31,680
It's probably a really sound decision on his part

2304
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
In terms of where to take

2305
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,240
The rhetoric

2306
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,264
Eyewear

2307
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,288
To take the narratives

2308
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,568
If you want to try and shift

2309
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,104
Into some Direction

2310
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,384
Going against

2311
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,152
V

2312
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,944
Ineffective

2313
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,736
Turncoat Republican

2314
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Or whatever

2315
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
He's probably going to be your best

2316
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,576
Because then

2317
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:51,136
You'll probably get a little bit of the slack

2318
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,928
People on the road

2319
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,768
Caring about what you're doing chores and you're attacking the people they don't like

2320
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:00,352
You'll probably like less mean comments on Twitter or going

2321
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,376
Be calm and

2322
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,960
And you saw it exactly this model play out

2323
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,240
With Nick Fuentes

2324
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
That's when he started attacking

2325
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
Turning Point

2326
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,848
There was a lot of people who like a letter

2327
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
Sunfire

2328
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:15,456
Or there are a lot of people who are like haha look at this is Miss funny

2329
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
And in the process

2330
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,040
They passively or

2331
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,112
Die amplifying and laughing

2332
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,136
Them making

2333
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:23,904
Funneh

2334
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
Charlie Kirk

2335
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
Eat it

2336
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,024
Pushing and furthering Nick Fuentes

2337
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
So I think

2338
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,328
This is probably

2339
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
If you were

2340
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:36,960
Just trying to craft like what do we do next now that we know there's no chance shirt

2341
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:42,080
This is going to work out it's probably a sound thing to do

2342
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:47,712
Say going back to their terrible military strategy and then update it for for us here

2343
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,272
When your enemies are in fighting

2344
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,320
It is a bad idea to just let them

2345
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
Watch or just watch it

2346
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,416
That's when you destroyed both of

2347
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,256
Can't allow them to regroup after

2348
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:05,120
Defeating their inner power struggle in order to become even worse

2349
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,168
Parts of it probably intren

2350
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,216
During that inside

2351
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
Then we saw that in

2352
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,032
2009 onwards

2353
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
The Tea Party

2354
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
We are going to

2355
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,896
To probably see that

2356
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,176
I don't I don't know what you

2357
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,736
You do like I don't know I don't like to talk about

2358
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,504
Crushing

2359
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
Because I think

2360
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,296
But that's kind of

2361
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,832
I don't know

2362
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:27,648
Imagery and I'm not super into that

2363
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,696
I don't know what you do to push back against

2364
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:35,072
But I do agree with you like watching and laughing like haha they're destroying each other

2365
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,352
Is not good

2366
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,400
When one of the parties that is doing

2367
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,960
The destroying is far more extreme

2368
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:45,568
That's not to say hey we should defend him GOP

2369
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
It's just that

2370
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,408
Neither of those is a winning strategy

2371
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,968
Do is what the right has always done so

2372
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,248
Successfully to the left

2373
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,528
In the center which is

2374
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,832
Exacerbate whatever differ

2375
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
Prince's they have

2376
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
Force them to destroy each other instead of just

2377
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:02,208
The right never sits back and watches us

2378
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
Fight

2379
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
Fair enough

2380
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,608
The GOP

2381
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Which is what he said

2382
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
Years ago

2383
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,424
And then he said he had

2384
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
And then

2385
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
Trump dead

2386
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
And now I guess they're doing

2387
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Sing it again

2388
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
But

2389
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,824
This is so lucky

2390
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,664
Nick starts talking about is view of America

2391
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,944
No

2392
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
Cuts out

2393
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,016
Exactly the right guy

2394
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,832
We're taking over the party

2395
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
We are the people we are the pop

2396
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,392
Populist movement

2397
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
Describe

2398
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
The new Reich

2399
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,792
Not well I call it America

2400
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,608
Distinguishes us from

2401
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Is orange

2402
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,912
Interpretation of what is America

2403
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
America

2404
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,496
Is the American people

2405
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,824
It's not America as its economy it's not America

2406
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
As its government

2407
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,872
It's not going to talk

2408
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,784
We are

2409
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,856
Live right now we have Alex Jones and Nick

2410
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,136
Wenches are

2411
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,720
Transmission there are connection has been interrupted we will get

2412
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Imparted

2413
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,096
If I were producer and I were watching this and I knew who Nick Fuentes what

2414
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
Exactly

2415
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,984
I'm not saying that's what happened it's not America the Republic

2416
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:25,664
If you talk about what he believes the American people are

2417
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,456
It's going

2418
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:33,856
To become a little blunt what his beliefs are did hit the red button or anyting

2419
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:37,184
Equally possible that their Tech issues just suck so much

2420
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,488
If I were there I would have done exactly

2421
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,792
Because I can't risk

2422
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:42,816
Like

2423
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,120
That game getting blown up

2424
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,680
And a bridge waiting for them to be like

2425
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,216
And we're going to

2426
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:55,360
All the people with mental health issues and put them in the

2427
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,176
Immigrants have to go

2428
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,712
And okay

2429
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
Well

2430
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Step

2431
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:04,320
Anyway I thought that maybe that trucker strike

2432
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,112
Nick was talking about was Joe

2433
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
Just trying to rile up the

2434
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
The crowd

2435
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,696
It turns out he really

2436
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,976
Is in support of this

2437
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,768
Which is weird

2438
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,072
It's weirder that Alex is to

2439
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,168
Okay fuckout tell you I really like what I'm seeing with this trucker strike

2440
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
If they're planning later this month

2441
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,008
For a week

2442
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
If the trucker strike

2443
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,592
Especially on the East Coast shutdown

2444
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Thanks for shutting

2445
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,688
You shut

2446
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,248
You down and I should come to Georgia another state

2447
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
I just drive around

2448
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
The whole time

2449
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,600
I'm calling for you

2450
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
On Thursday Friday and Saturday here

2451
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,672
At noon everyday

2452
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,696
Drive

2453
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,464
Around

2454
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,232
The

2455
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,792
Honking your

2456
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,328
Horn

2457
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,168
Nick is a child so I'm less interested in his political philosophy make

2458
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
Incoherent sentence

2459
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:56,288
Alex on the other hand should definitely not be in favor of a strike just

2460
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,056
Because he likes

2461
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
The goal of it

2462
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:02,688
The means that's being used to achieve the goal is the withholding of Labor in an organized fashion

2463
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,224
Which he totally hates

2464
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:09,600
It's interesting and kind of ironic why this plan that Nick is so keen on would never work

2465
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:12,672
The biggest reason is deregulation and Union Bus

2466
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
Thing in the shipping and trucking

2467
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,536
According to Snopes there used to be two million Truckers

2468
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,816
Members of the teamster

2469
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,352
So now there are only seven

2470
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,120
35000

2471
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:24,960
Great the institutional power the trucker's had in the 70s from Banda

2472
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,520
Getting together and keeping those Union strong has disappeared

2473
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,312
Largely due to political influence

2474
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,640
Hope people who naked Alex would be largely in agreement with

2475
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,944
At least as far as labor issues go

2476
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,992
There is often Big Talk

2477
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
About truckers strike

2478
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,064
Because it brings to mind

2479
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
Complete shutdown of food

2480
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,904
Distribution in the Myriad issues that come along with it

2481
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:47,488
But the sad reality is that these strikes don't really end up having

2482
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,280
Any real impact because they can

2483
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,864
If you're a trucker and you want to strike are you going to get the

2484
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,936
Teamsters to strike to install Trump as president

2485
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
You really think that's going to work

2486
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,520
That's probably never going

2487
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:02,080
To happen so if you're working in a union shop

2488
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,640
That's not going to be a strike that's going to be you quitting

2489
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,176
If you're an independent

2490
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,736
Penda truck or maybe you work for a smaller outfit

2491
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,528
It's theoretically on board at this strike

2492
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
You probably can't afford to do it

2493
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,600
Because there's no protection

2494
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,368
For you

2495
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:17,440
You have no wait to throw around by withholding your labor

2496
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,976
Since whoever is hiring

2497
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,256
Could just hire somebody else

2498
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Does tomatoes need to get to Kansas

2499
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,608
And you're on strike to install your fantasy

2500
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,400
Great good for you

2501
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,168
You're fired

2502
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,728
And this other truck is going to get paid to haul those tomato

2503
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:34,080
The only way this kind of strategy could work is ironically

2504
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,384
If the world was exactly how Alex and Nick

2505
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
Don't want it to

2506
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:42,528
If the truckers union was strong and everyone in it could vote to stop work because they felt the elect

2507
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,296
Action was stolen

2508
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,368
You be super f***** up but they could make a pretty huge statement

2509
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,904
The political movement

2510
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,720
The Alex and Nick are apart of his actually insured

2511
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,512
That this can never really happen

2512
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:58,912
It is because it's clearly them being like well we would love unions if they agreed with us and for some reason week

2513
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:01,984
Can't get unions to agree that we should destroy Union

2514
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,008
Then I just don't get it

2515
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,568
Honestly even if it did

2516
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,872
Could possibly happen this idea

2517
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:12,480
It doesn't matter on this day when this episode recorded November 18th

2518
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,528
The guy who organized this strike

2519
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,296
Called it off

2520
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,648
Cool probably because it was an absurd idea that would only hurt the participants

2521
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,696
Send a cheese literally nothing

2522
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,768
Yeah I'm fascinated by this like

2523
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:27,584
Application of their political beliefs though

2524
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:33,216
Like I don't understand it believes are we will do anything to get what we want

2525
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,240
So if that's

2526
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,264
That's why it always

2527
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,800
It gets to me whenever somebody's like

2528
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:39,872
Mitch McConnell's hypocrite or any of that b*******

2529
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,920
They're only political belief

2530
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,968
Is here is the thing that I want

2531
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,016
And I will do anything to get it

2532
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:49,088
So there's no possible way for them to be hypocritical in this

2533
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,696
I understand that you know I understand that

2534
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,464
People like Mitch

2535
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,232
McConnell

2536
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:00,608
I know that Alex isn't any better but his brand is supposed to be that he's

2537
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,728
And that

2538
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,520
Just kind of weird to me that like

2539
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
I get it

2540
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,128
I don't get how you don't

2541
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,504
I know right away Alex's traffic is way up

2542
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,344
Because of course it because of course during these sorts of. Alex ends up getting

2543
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,672
Much more traffic I think a lot of the time people want to see him drunk

2544
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,208
Crying or something

2545
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,768
There's a lot of potential for

2546
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,816
Something a couple times

2547
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
In the last

2548
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,352
Last couple weeks

2549
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,912
The traffic is way up and no one's buying it

2550
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,752
Total characteristic of either artificial traffic

2551
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,056
Or people tuning in to beat like

2552
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,456
Aziz like traffic is so it would

2553
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:51,040
Triple the size but people are buying anything and I just don't

2554
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,344
We are seeing 45 times

2555
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,624
Homicide

2556
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,672
The Bible say don't know what

2557
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,208
Sad

2558
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:58,976
FBI

2559
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,256
Restaurants sit down

2560
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
They put CIA sticker

2561
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,912
And I just want to know they're watching

2562
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
Course we know

2563
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:08,704
That you're helping

2564
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,240
Died in the end of America

2565
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
History peaceful

2566
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,080
I'm good but it's not

2567
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
Sterilizer

2568
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,640
Are coming with 5G

2569
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,016
I just remember

2570
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,808
Unicron

2571
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,576
Into the wind

2572
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,136
You're destroying

2573
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,720
You're destroying everything so I feel good about what I'm doing and I'm

2574
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,816
You are

2575
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:35,840
You don't stay

2576
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
Campbell.

2577
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,424
Two-faced God real

2578
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:41,984
Wow

2579
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,008
Wawa

2580
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
That's antenna

2581
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:49,152
Alex is traffic is way up and

2582
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,688
The feds are following in the pudding

2583
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,456
CIA

2584
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:55,040
Stickers on his car and I'm confused as to why they would do

2585
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,112
Is that a just a like

2586
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Gentle remote hey guys we're watching

2587
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
Just to let you know

2588
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:04,256
We can put a cigarette in your car anytime we want

2589
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
I don't

2590
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
Know if

2591
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,864
The CIA isn't

2592
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,912
Pranks

2593
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
Kids

2594
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:18,080
It certainly could be I mean I think or I could be people who used to like Alex and now decided he's a shill or

2595
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:21,920
During the CIA we're going to label your car

2596
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:28,320
I ain't worried didn't happen at all and Alex's imagine

2597
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,904
These things are possible if what I think is not possible

2598
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,184
Is the defect

2599
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:39,328
The following him around Atlanta

2600
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:45,472
To be going around and putting CIA stickers on Alexander

2601
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:46,752
I don't know if they exist

2602
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,824
So Alex gets in this next clip to what I

2603
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,592
Pinkbike

2604
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:54,944
Maybe possibly his big news but it just makes no sense that this would be the big news

2605
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,480
We're here I've got

2606
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:59,296
Big news I said the austro-hungarian empire

2607
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,112
The freedom screen

2608
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,392
Of those of us that were

2609
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
Will go away justifications washer

2610
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,536
Fighting

2611
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,328
The fraudulent election

2612
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,864
Deposition

2613
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,424
Trump

2614
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,192
Put a big

2615
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,032
We're just getting started

2616
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
So I guess

2617
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,360
These big news is that

2618
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,640
Trump isn't the

2619
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,176
Which is not

2620
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:32,576
Doesn't sound like news at all big hit in 2016 before Trump won the election

2621
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:36,672
I was like listen here's the major victory for us

2622
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:39,488
Step along the way

2623
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,768
Yeah I don't know

2624
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,584
If there was some sort of actual big news

2625
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
It's not gotten

2626
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
M2 at all

2627
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,680
It's just that we'd keep on fighting

2628
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,704
And what have you

2629
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,080
Weird way but it's actually not that weird

2630
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Really revealing

2631
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:58,176
What they've done is they've disenfranchise 70

2632
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,456
3 million Trump

2633
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:03,040
The president gained 10 million voters but

2634
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,064
Between 2016 and

2635
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:06,368
There's more Trump supporters than ever

2636
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,648
Is more patriots than ever

2637
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,928
Dinnerware of globalism

2638
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,232
The idea that stealing the election

2639
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,000
From us

2640
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,024
Canceling our vote

2641
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:16,096
In disenfranchising 70 some million people

2642
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,912
There we go away after all of that if they just

2643
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,752
Through you know they speed through the process they see Joe Biden

2644
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,312
We just disappear Into Thin Air

2645
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:28,384
Losing an election is not the same thing as being just

2646
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
Franchise

2647
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:32,480
But this is actually a really neat Moment of clarity for Nick

2648
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,528
Because it is the same thing to him

2649
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,088
He believes that he's entitled to win everything

2650
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,880
Dang Weatherby do to the color of his

2651
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:40,160
Scanner is radical

2652
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Catholicism

2653
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
This is the same mentality

2654
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:46,048
You hear in that tape of Richard Spencer Milo

2655
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,584
In his rant

2656
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,864
Spencer said quote

2657
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,144
Like this is never over

2658
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,728
I win they f****** lose that's how the world f****** work

2659
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
Little f******

2660
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
Kay's

2661
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
Weed

2662
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,080
They get Rules by people like me

2663
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,360
My ancestors f****** in

2664
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:01,152
Enslave those little pieces of f******

2665
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,944
I Ruled the f****** world

2666
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,968
Those pieces of f***

2667
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:06,784
Kinship get ruled over ruled by people like me

2668
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,112
They look up and see a face like mine looking down at them

2669
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:15,488
Who's audio was allegedly recorded the day after the unite the right rally in 2017

2670
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,256
Teen witch

2671
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,024
Nick Fuentes

2672
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,304
Pardon

2673
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,632
It's not hard to understand that underneath whatever slick presentation

2674
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:24,192
Kinfolks like Nick have that Rage of entitlement

2675
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:25,472
Is just below the surface

2676
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:31,872
It makes total sense for him to claim that losing an election is disenfranchising his side because he's entitled to

2677
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,456
What do you ever think that all the people who voted for Hillary and 20

2678
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:37,248
SeaWorld disenfranchised

2679
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
No course

2680
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:41,856
Cuz they're entitled to lose to someone like him there globally

2681
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:46,720
And they're evil and they should be the lie I know it's very very f*****-up

2682
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,488
Exactly what they

2683
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,328
Yeah they want a while I mean if you want a homogenous Nation

2684
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,608
The idea that

2685
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,656
Losing an election is false

2686
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,680
Possible is kind of silly

2687
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:56,960
True

2688
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:59,264
And I mean like

2689
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:05,152
He's not going to be pressed on this on Infowars cuz Alex doesn't want to open up this box of worms butt

2690
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:08,480
I mean he believes that people who have like immigrated

2691
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,248
Here

2692
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,272
Shouldn't vote

2693
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:13,600
And stop knick-knack I have a couple of quick questions for you

2694
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,136
Do you want a white Nation

2695
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,696
Wow okay

2696
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:18,720
Follow-up question

2697
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:22,048
Have you ever heard of what happens to people who don't have quote

2698
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
Pureblood

2699
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,096
In a white Nation

2700
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,376
I've heard

2701
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:30,752
I've heard you are heard what happens to people who do not have

2702
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,032
Sore blood

2703
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,848
That's a point that comes up in a number of discussion

2704
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
That he's had that

2705
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,456
I'm seeing the point about his last name being Fuentes

2706
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:45,600
I don't know I don't really deal with that

2707
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,904
Now anyway

2708
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,696
I think it's interesting

2709
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,048
This is all very revealing

2710
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,352
This the conversation that they're having

2711
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,632
Whether it be

2712
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:59,168
Owen being like

2713
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,704
Yeah my violin

2714
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,032
Okay

2715
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:08,128
Trump gave them an ephemeral chance that they had no idea what's happening

2716
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,176
Because he put it in a quart

2717
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
Filing Fleury said that

2718
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:17,088
Demons were flying in from Stargates to s*** on our shoes

2719
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,136
All of their specific point

2720
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,416
It's the third making about

2721
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:22,464
These are the various States

2722
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,232
Nonsense

2723
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,280
Nick is just

2724
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,560
Talking about

2725
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,376
Taking over the GOP

2726
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,424
Probably is the most singular Focus

2727
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,264
And I don't know if he actually believes this or he knows that Alex

2728
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,032
It's believed that

2729
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,568
And therefore it's best

2730
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:42,176
Play into Alex's believes that he's presenting himself as also

2731
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,712
Fighting the literal devil

2732
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,760
Spiritual war

2733
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:47,296
You know don't forget it's not about

2734
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,576
On some level even

2735
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
Looking to Democrats

2736
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,416
Globalism people although it is in some sense

2737
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,440
It is about

2738
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,232
The rulers and the principal

2739
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,280
Of other Realm

2740
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,816
Evil vs. good

2741
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:06,496
So I don't know if Nick actually believes that if he's doing the

2742
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:09,056
This to manipulate Alex either is possible

2743
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:12,384
But also use the Republicans Or democrats

2744
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Globalist

2745
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,176
Scorpio

2746
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,736
Economy there

2747
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:20,320
Stream he's genuinely one of those

2748
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,856
Truly terrifying cycle

2749
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,648
You know

2750
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:26,720
Like he's he's a guy who provides you

2751
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:30,304
I would say that ninety-nine percent of the people

2752
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,584
In the world you can act

2753
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,120
The reason

2754
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,424
But guys like nipple

2755
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Hazard that argument for like

2756
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,752
You can't talk to this

2757
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,800
Either terrifying psychopath

2758
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:44,896
What can only be handled by a larger power

2759
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:49,248
Federal

2760
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,576
Obviously a level of something

2761
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:56,416
Somebody needs to step in because this isn't a like one-on-one

2762
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:01,792
Conversation that you can have with Nick later if you were someone in his life you might want to try and let get him help

2763
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:06,400
Get me like a couple months ago he got he posted a video of him going to lie

2764
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,704
Electro love black lives matter protest

2765
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:11,264
Larry like I had one of his friends had assignments

2766
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,288
But I can't read

2767
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:16,896
Yeah like parroting I can't breathe these the type of person who does s*** like

2768
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,992
It's just like you take the political stuff out of it take the

2769
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,784
Take anything out of it

2770
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,808
It's just

2771
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,600
Antisocial

2772
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
Disgusting Behavior

2773
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,416
And

2774
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
I don't know

2775
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
Anyway

2776
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,768
I think it we saw a little bit if that's seapak

2777
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,536
Appearance

2778
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:34,304
Is sort of

2779
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,072
Continuing

2780
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:37,376
It's not been as

2781
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
Consistent or direct

2782
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:41,728
As it appeared it might be

2783
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,288
I was kind of trying to

2784
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,616
Usurping a little bit a little bit

2785
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:50,432
He's taking up a mantle

2786
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:52,224
Call here as more of a

2787
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,016
Actual leader

2788
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
Malik

2789
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:58,368
And that's kind of scary but also like what are you going to lead

2790
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392
Alex's

2791
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,672
Kingdom is a loser

2792
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,208
Really exist

2793
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,256
The thing that I was

2794
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:10,144
Wondering what you want to be the next Owen Shroyer good luck I mean we saw this on his ambition is clearly

2795
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Fallout pie

2796
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:16,032
Yahweh way higher than being a second-in-command

2797
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,592
Kind of why I receive project involves

2798
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:20,128
Using Infowars

2799
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:26,016
Not being a part of it is almost even embarrassed that they are

2800
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:28,576
The sort of people he has to

2801
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,880
As soon as he gets outside of their level he's not

2802
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,928
He's not a ladder up guy

2803
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:41,632
What was the what was the name of the event that they wanted the RNC

2804
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:43,680
Remember

2805
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:48,288
Went out got super drunk and couldn't

2806
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,872
Yeah

2807
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:56,992
Really drunk and peed on a tree

2808
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,016
Spell good time

2809
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,344
No it back whenever Fuentes

2810
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,368
Showed up and

2811
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,904
And clearly stole the show from him

2812
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,464
Like even then my first thought is like

2813
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,488
Alex Bisson

2814
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Not somebody that you can

2815
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,048
Use

2816
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,840
This is somebody you should watch out

2817
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,632
This is somebody who's gunning

2818
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400
For you and

2819
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,424
And if you can't see that

2820
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,448
You're insane.

2821
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,472
You know

2822
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:22,336
Yeah but Alex and him can co-exist as long as he follows Nick

2823
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,128
Yeah like I said

2824
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,920
It's big next season

2825
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:27,200
The next project

2826
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,992
Is destroying the GOP

2827
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,016
Do you want then

2828
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:33,344
Extremist tea party will

2829
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,880
Then the two of them couldn't have,

2830
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:37,440
Macaws and coexist perfectly fine

2831
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
It's just

2832
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:38,976
Wants

2833
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:41,792
Nick when Tyson is like larger project

2834
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:45,120
Leaning towards Catholic fascism

2835
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,680
It becomes more apparent that's where he metallic

2836
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,728
What's my come to loggerheads

2837
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,264
Yes but that's

2838
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,312
See that's the thing though if you're Alex

2839
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:56,896
You have to see Nick Fuentes and realize tooth

2840
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
1

2841
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,200
It's it

2842
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,992
He's never going to bend to you

2843
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,528
That's never going to have

2844
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:05,344
And two there's only two ways that go

2845
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:07,392
You been to him

2846
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,416
Or he

2847
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:10,464
Those are the only option

2848
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,000
And when he's gone

2849
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,280
But he disappears haha

2850
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:18,144
He's planning something against you what don't you understand about who

2851
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,448
People who their friends are

2852
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:26,848
Everybody who's run afoul of Rodger Stone Rodger stone is tried to destroy

2853
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:31,456
You don't think you sent me that you think he's going to be like well I have some sentimental

2854
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:36,064
Metallic friends with Larry klayman

2855
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,088
We saw that

2856
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,904
Exactly it's not don't

2857
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,928
Don't

2858
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:41,952
Get involved

2859
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,512
Seems like

2860
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,328
I mean like just

2861
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,608
Quite frankly

2862
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:49,888
Switch

2863
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,168
IntelliJ

2864
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:53,472
Able to

2865
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,800
Guess yes razor Focus

2866
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:59,872
Nazi General Lee with people who are in the Infowars here

2867
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:04,992
Like obviously I agree with you if I were Alex I would be terrified of him

2868
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:05,760
And work

2869
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,808
Trying to destroy

2870
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,600
Either that or pretend he doesn't

2871
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:12,416
Toto

2872
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
Because

2873
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,208
Knickers

2874
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:18,048
Fairly popular in these right-wing worlds he has

2875
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,144
I do know whatever amount of juice that he doesn't grow pers

2876
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,680
And stuff and Alex wants a piece

2877
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,240
It's just so weird to be watching a

2878
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:28,544
Greek tragedy happen and not have them

2879
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,312
Like

2880
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:34,432
If you're watching a play and you're watching a Greek tragedy or like man those characters have no idea what's coming

2881
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:37,248
Well here's where I would take issue with that

2882
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:43,648
It's the same thing with me saying that like Alex should only be in studio in owensby is proxy

2883
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:46,464
Is what they should do and what it could play out

2884
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,000
Can be disappointing when it doesn't

2885
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:50,048
You looking at this as a Greek tragedy

2886
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,584
Is also probably not how it's

2887
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,888
Going to play out it'll probably drink

2888
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,656
Interesting

2889
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,960
Then it is

2890
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,496
Cuz people develop

2891
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,032
Open people change over time

2892
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,592
And honestly I think the most likely thing

2893
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,616
What's going to happen

2894
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:04,384
Is

2895
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,408
That

2896
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,456
Alex

2897
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,224
And Nick

2898
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
Will have

2899
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
Some sort of in a lion

2900
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,832
And be able to work together

2901
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
Attacking the GOP

2902
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,392
And then

2903
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,416
I don't know

2904
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,952
Nick can't help himself

2905
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:22,560
He's also a f****** extreme Troll he's alone is going to do something that ends up

2906
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,328
Getting him

2907
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,912
Kicked off whatever streaming platform he's been relegated to now

2908
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,704
Or whatever

2909
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,496
You can't not push the envelope

2910
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
Estrella

2911
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,312
Be some sort of

2912
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,336
An extremist voice

2913
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:36,384
Next next

2914
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,432
George Lincoln Rockwell or some s***

2915
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,456
Yeah probably

2916
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:43,040
I just he's just one of those guys who it seems like

2917
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:45,088
Speakeasies that like

2918
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,112
Dark

2919
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,160
Candidate in the GOP that they

2920
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,184
Cannot see,

2921
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,256
You know that we just don't see him coming

2922
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:57,888
Completely different people now and then Nick tortoises are they realize their Nick Fuentes

2923
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:00,960
I don't I don't think I do I do that

2924
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,520
Writing a supervillain story

2925
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,312
We're only a s*** hat

2926
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,848
Like a really dangerous s*** head

2927
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,688
We have a couple last Clips here

2928
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:15,552
And just a little little chicken on how Alex's operation

2929
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
Is going

2930
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:19,904
He did a money bomb a little while ago

2931
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,952
You made a lot of money from that

2932
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:23,744
But then he also decided to send

2933
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,768
The tank across the

2934
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
East Coast

2935
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:27,584
So that was a bad idea from

2936
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:32,192
And then he's been flying all over the place and he goes like a large security detail

2937
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
And then also has two

2938
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,008
The broadcast remotely

2939
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,824
Apparently this hasn't been a great idea

2940
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,128
Break

2941
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,944
Growth

2942
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,480
Madonna

2943
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,528
What we caulk Snow crew

2944
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,112
Like why bother products

2945
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,904
Infowarsstore.com

2946
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,720
Are more cruel to be able to

2947
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
The Beyond

2948
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,304
He can't afford to do the nightly show now

2949
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,352
Just canceled it for a week

2950
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,960
He'll be back

2951
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:05,984
In Austin

2952
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,800
Like Manpower

2953
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,360
Will be able to be moved that that's it

2954
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,128
Then

2955
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:14,432
Operation there is like no

2956
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,736
If there's no one else to run the board

2957
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:20,320
You can't afford to pay someone I don't know 20 bucks an hour or something

2958
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:24,160
That you can't get someone on it like some freelance person

2959
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:28,256
Wow guess not if that is the difference

2960
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,048
It's between like

2961
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,072
I like

2962
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:33,120
We have the money for it we don't

2963
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,144
That's a

2964
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,936
That is a razor real bad

2965
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,472
That's real bad I don't know if that's

2966
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:39,264
Actually true or not

2967
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,032
Assume that it's just

2968
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:40,800
It's not worth it

2969
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,848
I would oigi that would probably make

2970
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,384
The most sense to

2971
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,968
And it turns out it was between that cancel the nightly show

2972
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:48,736
Get rid of David

2973
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,528
I just we don't

2974
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,552
The forces

2975
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,344
Run the show

2976
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,904
Infowars my shoulder

2977
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,184
The day the War Room

2978
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:58,976
Which was it

2979
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,400
Tacos way

2980
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:11,008
Force.com is it real

2981
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,544
12 round

2982
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,080
Infowarsstore.com

2983
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,104
Great products big syllabi

2984
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,152
Jon rappoport no more fake news

2985
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,176
I'm taking over

2986
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:20,224
God bless you all see it in Georgia

2987
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,504
State Capitol

2988
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,072
Oh

2989
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:38,400
Watch out

2990
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:40,448
It takes zero for us to suddenly just

2991
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,472
Start jamming a little bit

2992
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:46,080
Totally that is total

2993
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:48,896
I have no problem

2994
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:52,992
Confident to the staying power of my organization and I had to

2995
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:54,016
Fire someone

2996
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:59,904
Weatherby the nightly show or beloved David Knight hey you know what we don't get money by be gone

2997
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:00,928
The f*** out of here

2998
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:01,952
Anyway here's

2999
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,096
The show

3000
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:10,912
Very very

3001
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:16,800
They just heard us maybe I should have learned long ago and learned fairly read

3002
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:20,384
At face value with Alex's Financial

3003
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,664
Financial talks

3004
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:25,504
Meme something about everybody

3005
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,296
I don't know but

3006
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:31,136
If the nightly shows canceled for a week because Alex is in Georgia

3007
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,416
That does not itch

3008
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
Byron cop

3009
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,208
Put into terms of

3010
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,512
Mini trampoline just sucks

3011
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,816
I mean she does

3012
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:42,144
Yeah they like Deanna

3013
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,168
You suck

3014
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:50,336
Yeah we need to find a character for her I'm not sure what I haven't watched enough of her to really know what character she would show

3015
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,104
Giant ad

3016
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
Anyway that Owen as

3017
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,920
The proxy on the street

3018
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,736
The mechanic monochromatic snack

3019
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:59,296
I see what you did there

3020
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,856
Thank you know

3021
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,928
No there's nothing better

3022
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:08,000
When making a little joke and having somebody say

3023
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,048
I see what you did there

3024
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:14,656
I just don't think that that conception of a character was any good

3025
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:17,984
The parody of the social justice Warrior

3026
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,776
Archetype or whatever

3027
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:20,800
They had no legs

3028
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:22,592
Even a good performer couldn't

3029
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:25,408
Nepal that off

3030
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,176
Such a bad idea

3031
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,712
I don't know

3032
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:34,368
Whatever we'll see what happens anyway I was a little disappointed by Alex in Georgia

3033
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,416
Just as a whole I think

3034
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,208
It was refreshing

3035
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,024
To hear him yelling in a bullhorn and people yelling back

3036
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,816
Getting people excited

3037
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,864
But you also notice once

3038
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:47,936
You watch enough of it that it's like this is really OneNote

3039
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:52,800
It's just that over and over again yelling the same catchphrases the same sort of

3040
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,104
A little blurb

3041
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:01,504
You want to fight you better get her done

3042
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:08,160
Where is on it away that like you shouldn't be in Georgia for multiple days

3043
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,952
You should just be there

3044
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Frosting

3045
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,256
And then get back to

3046
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:14,048
To the f****** Studio where you're needed

3047
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:16,864
You know

3048
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,888
It didn't work out

3049
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:20,192
No Georgia

3050
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,264
And this is coming out on Monday

3051
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,824
So we'll know for sure near the surface

3052
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,104
Application status

3053
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,128
But

3054
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,432
Oh I'm sorry I mean with Misha

3055
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:34,272
Earlier

3056
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,088
And I don't know I just

3057
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,624
I think this is going to fizzle

3058
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
And they're going to need

3059
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:41,440
Define themselves on more solid ground

3060
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:44,512
It appears to me that's all that ground if they're smart

3061
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
Is

3062
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,608
A new Tea Party

3063
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:51,424
Attacking the GOP

3064
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:53,984
Yeah

3065
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:55,776
CC

3066
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,568
What's up

3067
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,456
We're also on

3068
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:07,808
We are on Twitter is at knowledge underscore fight it at go to bed Jordan

3069
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:14,208
We are on Facebook

3070
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:15,488
People doing God's

3071
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:20,352
But until then

3072
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,888
Clerk

3073
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:23,168
Find the juiciest ice

3074
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
Alex

3075
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,360
Birthstone colors
