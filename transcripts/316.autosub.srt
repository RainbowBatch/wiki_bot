1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alex

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,264
Everybody

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,640
You talk a little bit about Alex

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Jordan

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944

00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
9 a.m.

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Play cornhole in college to hang out with my boys

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
It's all I got. An improv guy when it comes to names

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,360
No I've never been to

14
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
I have a cross eye and I think it affects

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
My depth perception a little bit darts

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,296
Bags are particularly tough

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
To figure out the right angle on

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
Madoka be wrong if I start having a few

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,024

00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
I like shuffleboard more but

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Just cuz of that fun

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
I'm saying that's

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
Aesthetically I enjoy it

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Pretty good at bowling

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,360
Only when I'm drunk

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Okay

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Drunk are an amazing at bowling throwing the ball really hard

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
One time

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
E46 must be there's only one person who can confirm this but one time I bowled a

31
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
Perfect game okay temper Lanes here in Chicago

32
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Technically

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
Because it started

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
The fourth frame of one game and then continued into the

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
But I got 13

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Straight strike

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
But it was

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
That you would be the perfect game

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
But it was carried over to game

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Set

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
I was blowing my own mind

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
What if I do

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,936
The Michael Jordan game going Joe Fernandez

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,776
Chug another beer and throw ball really hard

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
Fernandes Addison Illinois

46
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
What what

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
It was not

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Bowled a perfect game

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Episode

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
Particularly about my prediction

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Generally

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Stray away from

53
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Then I'm making any kind of

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
Declarative statements about things that may or may not

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,824
Desiigner last episode

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
It had been reported that you were supposed to go give his deposition on July 1st

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Hooks trial

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
I'm Auntie was suspicious in his absence

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,160
At the end of last week reasonable conclusion

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,768
Didn't know if it was true but I made the leap of predicted you would be gone

61
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
Monday evening

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
Historically speaking the only predict

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
That are ever true are the ones where we're like

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
There's no way that we know what's going to

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Yeah the only prediction they all the sudden

66
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
You got to give it up to the Somali pie

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
Weather going to be right around the corner

68
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,696

69
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
And I was

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Immigrant

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm preparing a completely different

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
Do you know hey

73
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
Alex has been gone we haven't done present-day episode in about a week or so

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
So I figured it is our is our duty

75
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
To cover the July 1st

76
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
2019

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Episode

78
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,832
We started recording

79
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
I think this is one of the scariest pass

80
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Messages that I've ever heard.

81
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
The show so warning

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
If you're scared of things

83
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Yeah it's

84
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,447
It's actually just three hours of him singing God Bless America on a loop

85
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
I would find that I would take her to be like a little picture

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
Butter

87
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Would like to take a little

88
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599

And they're named Lookout

98
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
There might be listening to love God

99
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
Pretty hard

100
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Finally

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Somebody donated on an elevated level

102
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471

Freakishly large

106
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
If you're out there listening anything

107
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863

108
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Kygo Tour website

So I don't know how it's

118
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
You know what I hope it turns out well

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Prayers

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,151

Zavvi

126
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Counter demonstrators were out in force

127
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
You know ships

128
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
More of the details about that

129
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
The stage for what Alex

130
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
About first episode

131
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
I sent a lot of things are going to be true all my God so Maddie

132
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
There was much more in-depth

133
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Hereafter a few Clips but

134
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
It came out of the

135
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
The protest

136
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Counter demonstrators

137
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Dum Dums

138
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Is

139
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Osho Tobias

140
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
Lefty liberal media

141
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
One of the things

142
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Became out of that was

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
A lot of accusations

144
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
That people were putting concrete

145
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,671
Milkshakes at the premise of it initially was

146
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
They were turning them into

147
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
The bricks but then they could

148
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Broward

149
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
That works right

150
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Certainly

151
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
Alex

152
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Takes it

153
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Even further

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
They're making

155
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Bricks

156
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,455
In cups

157
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Case wide open

158
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
Exclusive

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
So many angles to the fact

160
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
Today's more than 100

161
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Wards.com

162
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
The eyesight

163
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,543
People's faces were burned it with acid

164
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
AR

165
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Big League politics

166
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Yeah

167
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Little bit further down the dial-in

168
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Mainstream

169
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
MSN

170
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Me and Betty

171
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
True

172
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Because Alex

173
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Proof

174
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
The videos

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
We have the audio

176
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
The photos

177
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,471
Michelle shared videos

178
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
Concrete

179
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
People faces

180
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Dot-dot-dot

181
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
That's probably a pretty good time to point out that

182
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
The right-wing is either manufactured or been

183
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Tricked by fake

184
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,327
Antifa accounts on Twitter and Facebook

185
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Bruises like that

186
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
People playing pranks

187
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Going on TV

188
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Pretending to be auntie

189
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,847
Fever like I want to punch a horse

190
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
It is something very eager to be tricked by

191
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
Go so far as to say they're looking for that information more than they are worrying about

192
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,927
You can make that claim I feel likes for me because I'm trying to stay on

193
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
I feel like that's an assumption that would be

194
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
You know I don't want to assume

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
Who knows

196
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
New York Times

197
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Chemical attack

198
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:35,807
Let's not get into that

199
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Real Petty

200
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Newyorktimes.com

201
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Sobec

202
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
So Jack.

203
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Get sick

204
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Yeah

205
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
I get it

206
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Gone

207
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
So the narrative

208
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
Concrete milkshakes is going to play a very large part

209
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
This episode so she's probably exhausted

210
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Right about now

211
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Surprise

212
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Justin

213
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Small point I might use the term

214
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Antifa

215
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,319
The way that Alex does I do not believe that they are a centralized

216
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Antifa is not

217
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Some sort of

218
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
What is the leader of

219
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,911
I don't know of any organization

220
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,543
Nobody's like I'm King Auntie right

221
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
To play into the right-wing framing of the

222
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Conversation in and of itself

223
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
Try and book back again try convection convention is best

224
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
What if I slip up here or there I apologize

225
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Clarity

226
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
And not living up to my own

227
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
I'll get into specifics here in a couple minutes but for now I want to make a

228
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Get totally clear the knot

229
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
It's completely manufactured fascist

230
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
Smear being perpetrated by dangerous monsters

231
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Details about this narrative

232
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Wyatt

233
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Sprite

234
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
Next we get them to something we've discussed in the past

235
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
The milkshake is the perfect weapon

236
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
Against people like Nigel farage or Alex Jones

237
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Because it really doesn't

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Elicit that much sympathy from them don't ones like you're hurting them

239
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,279
Nothing you can ever do in his life will undo the image in the headline of Nigel farage worth using

240
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Leave his bus

241
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Surrounded by people with milk

242
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
These m************ are a joke

243
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Their fevers response

244
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
Help highlight

245
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
We understand

246
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
But unfortunately so do they

247
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
They realize the potential of having to put up with a constant barrage of Milkshakes whenever they're out in public is a fate that there no

248
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Not particularly interested in

249
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Because make no mistake about it

250
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
What is going to happen or would happen

251
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
There'll always be someone willing to REI

252
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Riska Petty assault charge

253
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Particularly distasteful monster

254
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
With a milkshakes

255
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
So they have to go about the rest of their day

256
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Rally covered in

257
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
I will do a lot of hours of community service

258
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Estes Road milkshake

259
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Milkshake on Pol Pot

260
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,567
I think you'll be fine

261
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Panicstream

262
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,199
Comparison I'm trying to stay on diet

263
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
Just ask for

264
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Where's there

265
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Power is really only

266
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
Supported by being able to come

267
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Control Heather followers prestige

268
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,351
Considerably if they're constantly yelling.

269
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
It doesn't work for that

270
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
The best way to fight back again

271
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,799
Places to transform the milkshake into a deadly weapon

272
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
This is honestly one of those predictable developed

273
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
Information

274
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
It's a really short

275
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
Storm

276
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
People throwing milkshake

277
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
That makes us

278
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
Even more silly and way less manly ineffectual

279
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
I got a solution let's just kill us with those milkshake

280
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Great lunch

281
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
You can't throw rocks at me

282
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Right

283
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
People say with milkshakes

284
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
You are making me look silly

285
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
Just told people that milkshakes were Rock

286
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,063
It's like a milkshake is almost adapting the behavior

287
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,415
Consideration

288
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,255
The Narrative the concrete milkshake is born out of that mess

289
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Portland Police

290
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
Who said the quote that progressed officers learned from some participants that a substance similar to quick-drying Concrete was being a

291
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
This is not evidence

292
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
But it was enough for the Department to post a tweet on their official

293
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
Twitter accounts quotes

294
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
Police received information that some of the milkshakes

295
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Today during the demonstration

296
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Quick-drying cement

297
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
Anyone hit with substance

298
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Today to report it to

299
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
To the police

300
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,719
Now at least that tweets that just received information that this was

301
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
The case not that it was actually the key

302
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
There was Concrete in the milkshake

303
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
But it doesn't matter

304
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
That was enough

305
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
Immediately the right-wing media sphere of s*** heads

306
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,311
Jack Pacific retweeted a picture shot by Shane Burleigh a people making

307
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,431
They were adding the concrete no evidence at all

308
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Just talkin to

309
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Much like the quick-drying concrete that wasn't milkshakes

310
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Humidified very rapidly

311
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,439
Article started being published with misleading headlines that implied

312
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
The Portland Police

313
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,327
As opposed to what

314
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Which is

315
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Possibly even a right-wing s******* themselves

316
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
I told them that it was

317
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
McKay's

318
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
Business Insider published an article with the headline quote

319
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
Protesters threw milkshakes

320
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Quick-drying cement

321
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
As far left

322
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Far-right groups clashed

323
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Portland recordings

324
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
That article includes

325
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
This passage

326
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:30,879
Currently there is no evidence to substantiate the claim of concrete or cement found in any milkshakes

327
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,143
What the heck

328
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,751
Oh so they didn't put the

329
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Narrative

330
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:57,759
As evidenced by his proof that he was right all along bounce back

331
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
And forth very clear to see

332
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
This is a right-wing

333
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
Mirror from the Court directions

334
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Right into the right-wing media

335
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
The goal is to make this Avenue with bacon fashion

336
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Just look stupid and silly

337
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Making it treated like a life threatened

338
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,287
So counter-protesters can't make them look silly

339
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
That is the name of the game

340
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
There was no concrete being mix

341
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Milkshake

342
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,039
Text because if there was there's literally no way there wouldn't be any physical evidence

343
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
How many people would have accidentally

344
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
Drank concrete and died

345
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,207
How many easily identifiable puddles of concrete would be strewn around the park

346
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
How many people would be able to easily produce articles of clothing with concrete all over them

347
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
How many police officers would have their uniforms

348
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Covered in concrete

349
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,983
You'll be a really easy thing to prove if it were true

350
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
None of this has been produced as evidence because it doesn't

351
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Exist

352
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
The burden of proof is not on me

353
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
Or anyone else to prove that there was

354
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Concrete milkshake form

355
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
Heads are making this outrageous

356
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Just playing the concrete milkshakes

357
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
To be used as weapons in Portland

358
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
And does it is on them

359
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
To make their case

360
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Improve it

361
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
This is being circulated by career

362
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
But pretty clear motive

363
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Talk to

364
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Line of s***

365
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Make sense

366
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Sing it louder

367
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
That's what they

368
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
It's

369
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
Because the metaphor is so apt

370
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,103
The Portland Mercury put out an article quote Portland

371
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
Police offer no proof that protesters had milkshakes with quick dry cement

372
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
But it doesn't matter

373
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
By that point the right-wing narrative

374
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Concrete

375
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,831
It was a triple to fax new revelation

376
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
The Refuge

377
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
It's even more perfect

378
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Because most common form of concrete

379
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
Portland OR Portland concrete

380
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,815
You think I was some a conspiracy out of that but I guess I will take Sabrina

381
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
To learn about

382
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
He's not really into

383
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
That sort of thing

384
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
In a release put out July 1st

385
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
The police in Portland

386
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
And why they thought there was conquer

387
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,943
We're Liars said we're on their side

388
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
41 an anonymous person said there was

389
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
I understand the police department

390
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
Anonymous tip if someone is creating a weapon surreptitious

391
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
They wouldn't be doing their jobs if they didn't

392
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
When someone tells them to people to put in concrete

393
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Responsibility to look into it

394
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
Check in with people or a milkshake

395
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
You don't make sure there's no credibility to that tip

396
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,615
If you're unable to figure out what's going on you ask people giving out milkshakes to stop or

397
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
What you don't do is take the

398
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Twitter to broadcast

399
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Is b******* ruber

400
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,527
It's ultimately at its core right-wing propaganda

401
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
That implies that maybe you as a police

402
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Police Department around their side

403
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
Email after the fact

404
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
Which control

405
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
So that

406
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
After the fact

407
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
They got that anonymous

408
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Email after

409
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Vista the rally here.

410
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Happened after they put out this

411
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,895
An anonymous email was sent to Bureau members with a milkshake

412
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Which is laughable

413
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
It's a troll job

414
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,063
If I've ever seen one

415
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
How to get a sample of a bowl of blood to put it in

416
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Right otherwise it

417
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
Otherwise it doesn't do any good

418
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Alright I get I get the feeling that that's

419
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Instead

420
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
That there was concrete

421
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
Alright I understand

422
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,128
To do really f***** up

423
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
Someone sent a troll email let's use this is

424
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,296
What is a rationalization effect

425
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
Support the actions that were taken

426
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
It only works

427
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Post factually

428
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
It's f****** stupid

429
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
For now the last thing I want to say about this is that Alex

430
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
To take on the situation is far more

431
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
Severe than most of the right-wing should heads on Twitter and fox

432
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Most of them were approaching this

433
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,032
German angle that leftist or trying to break concrete milkshakes in order have bricks to throw

434
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Mechanical idea

435
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
But not nearly to the extent Alex

436
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Alex is

437
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,760
Full-on going to argue that antifa was out there making chemical

438
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
In this sense Alex is actually smarter than most of the main

439
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Extreme dumb dumb

440
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
Because if the argument is if they're trying to make bricks out of milkshake

441
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Set theory

442
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,096
Both salt and sugar have a delaying effect on the solidifying of conch

443
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Concrete workers use sugar or similarly constitute

444
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
To the product build-up give them more time to work the concrete before it sets

445
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,360
And it doesn't really take much sugar to cause that effect of very small

446
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Percentage

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Composition

448
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Sugar will

449
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Caused very serious delays

450
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,600
You just wouldn't be able to take the ingredients in a milkshake and add concrete to it

451
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
It makes all the brick

452
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Yeah

453
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,352
Who has bigger argument isn't there's chemicals in fast-drying concrete that will cause chemical burns

454
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Enter this

455
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Technically correct

456
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
Does cause alkaline Burns

457
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
When exposed to humans

458
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
However all he's done

459
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,384
Is further sensationalize things in no way

460
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
It's always really doing when you get down to it is making things worse

461
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
Is this narrative were true

462
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
They would be even more evidence available

463
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
Consider how many people were hit by stray books

464
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
How many people had them spill on

465
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
There would have been chemical burns all over the place

466
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
Evidence will be overwhelming but it's

467
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Not

468
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Call Alex is doing

469
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,144
Is escalating The Narrative to unsustainable

470
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Is it mainstream with a right-wing media is just interested in getting

471
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Stop throwing milkshakes

472
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Alex wants

473
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Do to be able to

474
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Kill anyone using

475
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
It's for family scary stuff

476
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
Episode

477
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Like I said rank up there with the most upsetting

478
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
Things I've heard him Advil

479
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,440
They implied there's nowhere else for his rhetoric and worldview to go

480
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Other than murder

481
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
I'm not please

482
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
He's looking for a shot heard round

483
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
On the world

484
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Because

485
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,752
Exactly if you break it down

486
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
What you've got

487
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
A built-in just

488
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Certification for preemptive

489
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Attacks on people who have

490
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Could be

491
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
I mean

492
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
Literally

493
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
If anybody who looks

494
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,400
The Kill

495
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Haven't

496
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,032
To resolve those paranoias and those fears

497
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
AR

498
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Unbelievably

499
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Barry

500
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Their offensive

501
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
They

502
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Leeds

503
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Probably the most dystopian

504
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
View of

505
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Of what could happen

506
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Next couple months

507
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
I don't know

508
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,768
Alex's idea that they have

509
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
On real people

510
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Eyes are all

511
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Mugshots

512
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
Shinhwa

513
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
Literally attack

514
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
It's all about perception

515
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
Milkshake attack

516
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,304
Pictures were circulated after the event

517
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
Saturday with a picture of a hand chemical burn and another was a woman who had

518
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
Her face has some chemical burns on it

519
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
You just reverse image search

520
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
A standard picture of a chemical burn

521
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Shutterstock

522
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,784
Like stockings remember exactly but it's

523
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
It has been for a long time

524
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,440
The picture of the woman with her face was

525
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
You reverse image search woman who had her face burn

526
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Buy essential oils

527
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:16,192
It has nothing to do with it

528
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
The concrete burning

529
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
People

530
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,128
But the stakes are shocked

531
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Because

532
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
We get this next

533
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,672
I want to stress like I've been talking a little bit extremely about the conclusions that Alex could come to

534
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,280
Terms of like

535
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
I wasn't talking s***

536
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
You literally

537
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Kind of expresses that

538
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,336
Fourth of July event

539
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
So it is just like

540
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Justification

541
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,544
You're there going to throw up milkshakes full of acid at your children if you shoot them you're the bad guy

542
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
F****** hell man

543
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,224
Are Alex works for the Portland mayor

544
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
And I'm not so interested

545
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Because

546
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
That idea

547
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
Milkshake to swallow

548
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,864
But I promise that will be the last milkshake.

549
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,728
I think it is

550
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
Because the relation

551
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Clear between

552
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
The right-wing Folk

553
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Police

554
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
What are the reasons the people took particular offence at

555
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,624
The Portland Police bureau's official Twitter account being used to publicize and lend credibility to the right-wing

556
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
About the concrete

557
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Milkshake

558
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Is it in the

559
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Troubling

560
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Trend of the Portland Police take the side of right-wing protesters

561
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Even when they're doing things that are

562
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Kind of f***** up

563
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,752
In June 2017 there was a rally in Portland that turned a little bit ugly

564
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,336
And OregonLive had article about it has been headline

565
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,920
Portland rallies without major violence

566
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Intervene

567
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
Impression that everything turned out pretty alright

568
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
However here's the fourth paragraph of that article

569
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,928
Officers deployed explosives and pepper ball to scatter anti-fascist

570
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,768
Crowd gathered at Vail Square just north

571
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Pro Trump

572
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
So

573
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,424
Just explosions and pepper balls

574
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
If the cops

575
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,872
The rally was taking place a week after Jeremy Christian had murdered two men on a train

576
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,688
Verbally assaulting

577
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Attack

578
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
You don't want to tell the police

579
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
That rally was organized by Joey Gibson

580
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Explosions in Peppermill

581
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
Leader of paper

582
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,424
Incidentally Gibson could also organize the far-right rally in Portland in April 27th

583
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
Jeremy Christian wasn't

584
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
And was found on video marching around doing nothing to lose

585
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
At the June rally gives

586
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Concerted effort

587
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
The distance from cell

588
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Christian which I think is a good idea

589
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
It's good for business

590
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Stanford history

591
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,392
Australian protesters for about an hour

592
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
But a report that came out from the Independent police review division pointed out

593
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,792
That the police never gave illegal reason for their detention

594
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
Call tyranny

595
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,472
Pictures and videos came out of Portland Police wrestling a counter-protester to the ground

596
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,056
That might not have been too shocking or cause for serious concern

597
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
But the other thing that was in that video certainly was

598
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,272
Kelsey member of the American Freedom Keepers militia is literally helping the police detain the

599
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,136
Kelsey would go on to tell the guardian that the police officer who was arrested the guy

600
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Had asked for his help

601
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,720
Despite there being a ton of other cops around

602
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
Literally three of them on top of this damage

603
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Alone

604
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
Play get this militia guy and give me a hand

605
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
Well I mean he's a militia member there so

606
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
The law enforcement

607
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
There's a really suspicious theme

608
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Emerging

609
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:49,856
The police were being on the side of the right-wing folks

610
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Anticipation was

611
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Confirmed on June 27th

612
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
2018

613
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,048
When the independent police review released their full report about the police response

614
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
At that rally

615
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,168
They said quote what Lieutenant felt the right-wing protesters were much more

616
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Stream from the left

617
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Protest

618
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
And the thing that they were

619
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
Because the left-wing folks were quote

620
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
A group that was diverse in their viewpoints

621
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Syntactic

622
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
A police officer

623
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,880
Well they're not all white

624
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,304
Portland Police Department was more or less showing where their priorities

625
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
And things got worse from

626
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,472
In October 2018 it was announced that members of patriot prayer were found on the roof parking

627
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Instructure in downtown Portland

628
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
A firearm

629
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Before a scheduled protest on August

630
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Earlier

631
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
Joshua said to have included

632
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,112
No one was arrested which may be an okay decision if none of the guns were illegal and everyone paperwork was in order and all that

633
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,976
You're not going to risk when might be considered

634
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Location with a k

635
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Chiron

636
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
That Revelation should at least inform

637
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
How you behave is law enforcement during the upcoming rally

638
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
But it did

639
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,776
Police charged counter-protesters without rally with their clubs drawing

640
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
After someone told them that they've been hit by a water bottle with quote

641
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
Likely came from a counter-protest

642
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
Likely came from

643
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,624
Doug Brown photographer who is there on the told the guardian the first missile ice and hurricane

644
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
From the Patriot prayer

645
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Across the street

646
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Toward the protest

647
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,280
I don't know who set it off but it went towards the black Bloc

648
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
And then the police just warm them

649
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
The hospital after being hit by a flashbang

650
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
Joey Gibson second-in-command a man named

651
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
Was seen at the protest in a shirt that read

652
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Cool

653
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,088
After another route

654
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
30th which descended into total chaos

655
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
It was declared

656
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
There's a clear pattern here it's one where the police department is

657
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Justin doing anything

658
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Control the far-right

659
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
The proud boys

660
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
That works he stayed violin

661
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
Actions under the guise of free speech

662
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,616
2980 Shepherd of the Willamette Week

663
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Joey Gibson

664
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Andy Portland Police

665
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
The messages start to make things a little more

666
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Portland

667
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Police Lieutenant Jeff

668
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,160
Leah appears to be providing protest

669
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,000
Gibson

670
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,096
The Portland Police were not monitoring protest hosted by The Liberation

671
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Confront in an attempt

672
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Dissuade Gibbs

673
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Right-wing group from

674
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
I'm showing up

675
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
Which is to say

676
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
You're going to get f***** up

677
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
If you do that

678
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
Get your back right which is f***** up

679
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,712
No no it's not

680
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,576
The police did long been a tool of the fascist state but

681
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,744
As the Dover State but it's also tough

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
For me to fully agree

683
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,376
Mansfield

684
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
Portland Police lieutenant

685
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,520
No texting all the time with Joey Gibson giving him all of them

686
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
All Visa friendly banter and information

687
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
27

688
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,944
Ulta

689
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Texting with

690
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Someone from

691
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Antifascista

692
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Anti-fascist activist

693
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
But that situation was a little bit

694
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,840
Whereas me I was providing information

695
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
To protect his right-wing group

696
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,192
Nia was using tan as an informant together

697
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Information about

698
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,592
I feel like this is a pretty succinct illustration of the way the Portland

699
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
Engage with this unfolding situation

700
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Finding a snail

701
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
Add feeding formation to the right-wing provocateurs so they can avoid

702
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
It is a trouble

703
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:09,696
There's far more to the story than I can credibly explain to you here on this episode but it's important to remember that nothing

704
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Stomach vacuum

705
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,816
So when the Portland Police Bureau tweets about something that's.

706
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Concrete milkshakes

707
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
It often can't be

708
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Seen as a single isolated event

709
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
But rather just one more instance

710
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
City gears long pattern

711
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Of the police department

712
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Declared their allegiance

713
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,408
Deciding with a crowd that is intermittent with neo-nazis white supremacist

714
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Istanbul

715
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Giving just the Republic

716
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
This is nothing

717
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
That's

718
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
The Portland Police bureau's current

719
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Is named

720
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Danielle outlaw

721
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Ironic

722
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:55,008
Outlaw everybody keeps for voter just like wouldn't it be hilarity great

723
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,592
Call composite law

724
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
So I mean

725
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,480
This isn't to say that the Portland Police Department is 100 /

726
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Working

727
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Kathy's right

728
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,696
You know it when you look at the information that's available

729
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
You look at the stories you look at the trend

730
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
There is a clear preference

731
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,936
Differential treatment of the two groups

732
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
What is not explained by the behavior of those two

733
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Yeah

734
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Explain by the behavior of the cops

735
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Soccer America

736
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Started

737
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
The whole job of the cops

738
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
What is 2

739
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Ensure any

740
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
Counter protest

741
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,600
It's a f****** to love the status quo

742
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,184
There's there's not been any protest in America

743
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
History where the cops have been on the site

744
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
On the side of good

745
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Sodas bacon

746
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,216
It's not like a it's not like hanging out with their worth

747
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Oh yeah

748
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Which is

749
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
I guess it doesn't really change

750
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,016
Chicago

751
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Chicago

752
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
You don't have to have a universal problem

753
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,672
It does appear that way

754
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
From everything I can

755
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
So it is next

756
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Just keeps doubling down

757
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Position

758
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Applications

759
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
For violence

760
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
Killing their political enemies

761
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
Fourth of July rallies

762
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Support Trump

763
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Rally's

764
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
With chemical attacks

765
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Amethyst

766
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
I don't know

767
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
I don't think we can

768
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:17,344
Expanding

769
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,768
I don't really think anyone who is against anti-vax

770
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,352
Is anyone is describing an honor

771
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
Kind of means

772
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
But what he's doing there is

773
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
He's taken

774
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
You know

775
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Everything

776
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
You go to

777
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Be f****** scared

778
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,904
Every moment

779
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
You know what to do

780
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
You know what to do probably going to have to kill him

781
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
We know it

782
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
It's Justified it's defensible they're going to hit

783
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Kid with a f****** chemical weapon

784
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,984
You want your kid to grow blind cuz some some antifascista

785
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Through concrete

786
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Then we'd better bring your barbecue that you're going to

787
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,760
Do you know what I love him with all of my family

788
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,344
None of whom are god-loving people who all carry guns in are afraid me

789
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
The exact same way

790
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,440
Is that a lot of people together with guns

791
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
And somebody maybe has a janky

792
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Trigger finger

793
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:33,888
And somebody walks up with the milkshake maybe they fire on accident guns firing real quick

794
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Iowa

795
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,984
Guy throws up

796
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Trigger reaction happen

797
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Alex

798
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,736
To report that there were

799
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Containers

800
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
Of chemical

801
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
The Portland rally

802
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
Should be very obvious

803
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
To Alex right now

804
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,352
That what that people drinking and would be dead literally

805
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,936
Doing exactly what the lead-up to the Iraq War was

806
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,800
Who cares

807
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Is Jordan of chemical weapon

808
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Containers

809
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,448
Fox News

810
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
It would be open f******

811
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,568
That's what they want

812
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
Being like a conversation

813
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
Yeah you know like it

814
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
What are chemicals

815
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
Milkshake

816
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
No matter how much

817
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Support social justice

818
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
No matter how much you are again

819
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
White nationalist

820
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
That you are breaking

821
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,680
Your crimes

822
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,248
After 1970

823
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Becomes like

824
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
Unjustifiable

825
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
Not

826
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
That's why they want it to be true

827
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Why it is never going to

828
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
So

829
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
Anyway it was next clip Alex

830
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
Explains that people with milk

831
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Presumably have concrete

832
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,360
Apparently

833
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:59,295
Moffitt hours

834
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
They never will

835
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
You never see the

836
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
These counter-protesters

837
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,679
Anywhere other than counter protesting super right-wing event

838
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
They don't show up to you

839
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Your house

840
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
But you know who does have a bit of a history with that

841
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
The proud boys

842
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,175
I'm a 2018 video artist Vic Berger formerly of Super Deluxe

843
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,015
Making fun of The Proud boys and their leader Gavin McInnes

844
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,159
Posted in the group chat

845
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Beck singing all caps

846
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Boat let's show them

847
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
Then dude showed up at Vick's House

848
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
Speaking to HuffPost Vic Berger said quote

849
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
When I answered the door you seem nervous

850
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Like he wasn't

851
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Expecting me

852
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
It was the middle of the day and my wife was home

853
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
He said are you Vic

854
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
Your your videos are hurting a lot of people

855
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
You're really hurting the proud boys

856
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
You need to stop making these videos

857
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Probably because Victor

858
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:06,111
Chase the guy immediately this incident didn't escalate absolutely

859
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
The next level of scary

860
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
The proud boys are gang where you literally have

861
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
Have to get into a fight or get arrested for the Gang

862
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
In order to reach

863
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
The fourth degree of initiation

864
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Which is the sort of thing you know

865
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
It's the sort of thing that

866
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,031
Did the sort of s******* to gravitate toward the game where you have to name cereals are getting softly punched

867
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
In order to join they might

868
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
That to me

869
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
Act out an assault

870
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
Don't like us

871
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,967
It does feel like that might be high

872
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
Vic Berger is harf Naomi

873
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,391
The critic of the right-wing who's been docs were threatened by the proud boys

874
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,207
Nathan Bernard also said his address posted

875
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Twitter and others

876
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
Members show up at their home

877
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
This is a hugely an appropriate level of

878
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Intimidation

879
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
Consider

880
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
To be a form of violence

881
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
And they know exactly what they're doing

882
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
You also Tommy Robinson

883
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
Who recently showed up at a Critic of his

884
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
At the Olympia Bank on his doors and window

885
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
This is of course

886
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
After keeping out the dude

887
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Got a dress on social

888
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:15,487
I was doing so course the banging on the walls was accompanied by a flood of threatening messages on the guy's phone

889
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:20,095
Mike called the police and Tommy left 5 a.m. do it all over again

890
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
This is clear intimidation

891
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
Stop giving critical coverage

892
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
The phobics ball right races

893
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
Misogynistic

894
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Somatic islamophobic

895
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
But overall s******* actors

896
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Our society

897
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
Quote

898
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
Isn't doing

899
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
They're not showing up at your house

900
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
They're showing up when you have a rally

901
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
2

902
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Make it harder for you

903
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
In public

904
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
Because your views are repulsive

905
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,279
That's what's going on no one's going he's goddamn house

906
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,095
Well anything that they are because

907
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,263
That's the same thing is putting concrete at the milkshakes

908
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,871
Indefensible like it should be for the Pro Bowl

909
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
The men Beyond this has gone to

910
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Too far

911
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
People we disagree with houses

912
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
To his critics

913
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:18,207
You got to give it to that guy

914
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Anyway

915
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,303
So in the next clip

916
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Sure that's pretty bad

917
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
Worried

918
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Okay

919
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
The shooter

920
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,455
That's a great plan is that a new route

921
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
Beat acid

922
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
Acid Beats

923
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,087
Milkshake

924
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
Yeah let's say that

925
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:52,511
This rhetoric

926
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,327
Translate you can really feel that this 35 seconds

927
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
Is indicative of why

928
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
To do s***

929
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Depleted

930
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Responsible

931
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
A very day

932
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
Together

933
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,391
Dry balls out

934
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327

Please remember we need your support America is going in

938
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,991
He needs to make it so extreme because that justifies why you need to give him your money

939
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,575

Antifas making chemical weapons

We need it

943
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Right

944
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
He doesn't care that he's putting people in

945
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
Very serious

946
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:09,055
Well it's no because he needs money on a timetable that justifies the timetable that people

947
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
You know

948
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Now it looks like

949
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:17,759
In the next couple days it's the summer of Rage

950
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:22,367
Just coming up so donate till we can fight but it's like I need $100,000 tomorrow

951
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:27,231
What is coming to your house

952
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,839
Who's on your kids at the 4th with the July 4th stuff

953
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
Reiterate

954
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
They're about to make their move,

955
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
Wow

956
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Very extreme

957
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Okay

958
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
So Paul Joseph Watson

959
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Interesting

960
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Idea

961
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,055
About how we go about

962
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Skin care

963
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,127
Of this year antifa problem

964
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
That's not good

965
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,759
. they coming from him

966
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
Okay so it's coming to 11

967
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,607
With an object which is

968
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,167
Why is that

969
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,055
Is that can no longer hide their identities

970
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
So that's an interesting idea

971
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,943
It's always great to hear noted guy who cries about

972
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,527
All the time Paul Joseph publicly

973
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
The government should be the business of regulating

974
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
Clothing choices

975
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,975
This s*** is really stupid considering how many right-wing demonstrators wear masks

976
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
How the government can

977
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
Control the People's Clothing

978
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
The f****** insane thing for us

979
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
Supposedly libertarian to advocate for

980
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
Is the problem is that mask

981
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,495
Make people harder to identify your solution is to

982
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,287
I got bad news.

983
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
Paint makeup sunglasses

984
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Facial hair

985
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:24,991
I guess the states

986
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:31,647
Also pretty sure a side benefit is that Alex and Paul Joseph Watson would then be able to make sure that Muslims couldn't wear their

987
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Are the Cubs

988
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Sure

989
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,791
And the best part about this Jordan

990
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,607
If you look at the pictures of the people who are making the milkshakes

991
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
Set the Portland protest most of them were not wearing

992
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,775
If you sincerely believe that these people were fixing up goddamn chemical weapons

993
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,103
In broad daylight around everybody taking pictures

994
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
You would expect they would have been the most heavily masks

995
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
People out there and I was not the

996
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Paul Joseph Watson

997
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,551
People not be allowed to wear masks

998
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Because they want to talk to them

999
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
It's subject a targeted harass

1000
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
It's that simple

1001
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
To step in and make

1002
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,791
Easier for them to figure out who these people are steak

1003
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
Soros

1004
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
This is one of their favorite weapons of the information Warfare RC

1005
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
It is simple bandanas

1006
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,383
So they're willing to throw away all their limited government evangelism

1007
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Freedom b*******

1008
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
When they're pushed to the wall

1009
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:34,367
When they're when they're back is to the wall and people with bandanas and dessert are wreck

1010
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
Kinder shop

1011
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,791
They cry for the state it really is

1012
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,887
Make it illegal for these people to make me look silly

1013
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:52,543
Well I would be a hero I would we were fighting a war

1014
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
Milkshake at resorts

1015
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
Strongman I look

1016
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Silly girl

1017
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Did the government

1018
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
Social safety net

1019
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
So Alex

1020
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
Paul Joseph Watson also due to very seriously like

1021
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Mad

1022
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
About the idea that they've been

1023
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,071
Kicked off social media not allowed

1024
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,375
On patreon they're not allowed on

1025
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
All sorts of other

1026
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,543
Places where normal people

1027
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,223
We know the group behind Alex's Gold Rose City antifa they've literally got a post on Facebook

1028
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,063
Right now

1029
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
People

1030
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,007
People need to contact this website

1031
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,663
Is being used

1032
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Who hosts that website

1033
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
I want to be clear I'm totally fine with

1034
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
Because if you do believe that this

1035
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
You know

1036
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,791
Somebody is so you know they're being supported on this platform if you want to make your voice

1037
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:22,143
Your disapproval towards that platform

1038
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Express

1039
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,799
To platform and his date so choose they can take the person off

1040
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Paul Joseph Watson

1041
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
Should not believe

1042
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
For the last

1043
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:43,647
They absolutely not be like 8

1044
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,207
Apply pressure so these places

1045
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Does he think he's

1046
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
They're going to

1047
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
Call his bluff

1048
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Like what do you mean

1049
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,055
Like I was saying that as like a

1050
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Well if we get back

1051
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
Why don't they

1052
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
That must be a tacit admission that they support

1053
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
He's just trying to hurt

1054
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Yeah

1055
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,159
I think it's all just a little

1056
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,951
Of the troops towards

1057
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
Like hey let's flood these places with message

1058
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,839
Maybe their crowdfunding to be taken away maybe we can get there

1059
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Website

1060
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Pizza Hut

1061
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
Take kicked off its host

1062
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
Let's start a brigade

1063
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
Kind of thing

1064
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Lame

1065
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
Certainly doesn't

1066
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Match up with

1067
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Anything they believe

1068
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
It seems like it

1069
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,415
Is so f****** indicative how is it the opposite

1070
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,231
Anytime there's something that goes

1071
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
It is just not working in your favor

1072
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Prince

1073
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
I'm one set of rules for everybody else

1074
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
And I want everybody else to

1075
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
Pretend

1076
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
So in the sex club

1077
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Prettiest

1078
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Texas

1079
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
And

1080
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
Version

1081
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Alex's

1082
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Position on

1083
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,695
The last terrorist move

1084
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
Chemical weapon milkshakes

1085
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,863
If that's true

1086
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
If what he is reporting is

1087
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
Is true if you believe that

1088
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
Why aren't you killing

1089
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:41,663
You know what I mean is a reality and you accept

1090
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,271
That is happening what happened

1091
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
Is it like

1092
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
Hey it's

1093
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,207
They're throwing chemical weapons at people

1094
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,047
Play Clair de Revolution

1095
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
Clandestinely

1096
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Throwing

1097
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,143
Chemical weapons at people

1098
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,191
And the government doesn't care

1099
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
How much more severe can the situation that Alex

1100
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
Is presenting ever beat

1101
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,359
I don't see I don't see another like

1102
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Ditto

1103
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
You can always

1104
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,343
Add a little design design

1105
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
Alex

1106
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
You are saying

1107
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
People are in

1108
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Some sort of a like

1109
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,191
No it's gone if you're throwing battery

1110
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Honestly

1111
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,871
This is only based on

1112
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Just knowing Alex

1113
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Through this show

1114
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
But I think there's a part of him that genuinely does not

1115
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
I think that it would be a war

1116
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Unless they

1117
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:59,231
Yeah I like up the police station

1118
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,839
How dare they use a guns

1119
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,751
I think that you might be right the idea of the shot heard round the world is

1120
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
That's interesting

1121
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,175
Something that I thought

1122
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
Nope

1123
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
Crazy Alex Alex has a new product

1124
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,695
He's selling in honor of his coverage

1125
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
But he wasn't almost

1126
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:36,607
Left of the clown World Ultra limited edition

1127
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,167
Dot-com

1128
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,287
So I wanted to bring this up because I heard Alex called his democratic debate coverage

1129
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,591
Clown world I don't really think too much about it

1130
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,687
It kind of makes sense that he would call the Democrats clowns

1131
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
If so

1132
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Just made so much about the fact that he literally said

1133
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
Fortunate

1134
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Because you pretty much takes every

1135
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
Really crossed my mind

1136
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Is it somehow weird

1137
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
However it's come to my attention

1138
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,375
From some people who spend more time

1139
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:13,215
Clown world

1140
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,031
Analysis clearly signalling

1141
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
Declare World meme began on the

1142
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
The publication forward Put It quotes

1143
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:27,039
They were they were describing the illogic of a liberal non-race

1144
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,087
Society

1145
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,135
When they were poestories Betsy

1146
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,951
Seem to fit into the world do they use the code Hawk Hawk

1147
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
Express that everything was back

1148
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,095
From there the terminology and me and took hold in all of the wrong place

1149
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
If you can't really popular on The Daily Stormer

1150
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
And on April

1151
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
22nd of this year

1152
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,359
Members of the American identity the white nationalist group formally known as identity evropa

1153
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,639
Dressed as clown

1154
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:58,271
And enter the New Orleans Public Library to disrupt a children's story time program being led by local

1155
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,831
Welcome to clown World honk honk

1156
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
Their signs that I'm really afraid because the right is

1157
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
They're getting really good at it

1158
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,999
The world is not for me

1159
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
I think you've been gone racing

1160
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
This means our kind of stuff

1161
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
So I'm probably not the best person to cover this topic and all the nuances of it

1162
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,239
But suffice it to say that Alex Jones

1163
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:23,871
And world at this meme that he's naming his Denmark cracked coverage

1164
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
, sourdough

1165
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
You know

1166
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,735
He knows what he's doing to Disturbed

1167
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
Pathetic to see how far he's fallen

1168
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,391
He's gone for being heavily associated with Ron Paul's campaign in 2012

1169
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,207
The drink a quart racist edgelords as fan

1170
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
Doing interviews with count dankula

1171
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
1029

1172
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,351
Really sad what a couple of really big

1173
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Bad decisions

1174
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
Can do to a person

1175
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Career

1176
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,727
Like I'm not saying that his career was amazing

1177
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
Before but comparatively

1178
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,359
S*** like just a couple years man

1179
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
Like it for him

1180
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
To those big decision

1181
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,903
A million small one

1182
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,463
Death of a Thousand Cuts

1183
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
Really made every May

1184
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,607
Mistake and then leaned into it

1185
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
He thought he could mistake his way through to the other

1186
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
Dukes of Hazzard

1187
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
Not working

1188
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
You can't jump Snake River Canyon

1189
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,847
And I can mixed metaphor

1190
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Here is my references

1191
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,479
Directions to the metaphor

1192
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,039
You're literally

1193
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Paradox

1194
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
So

1195
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
Anucort Alex's

1196
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Constantly saying

1197
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
Yeah I f******

1198
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Selfie

1199
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,839
Bro

1200
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
I love

1201
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
He's a good sales but

1202
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,239
Oh no my show

1203
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
Am I at

1204
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
Are different

1205
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
They're separate

1206
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:05,759
Now okay

1207
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,671
This little clip together is just so amazing

1208
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
How

1209
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,791
How exactly indicative it is of how intertwine

1210
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,351
Show and add our content

1211
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
Marketing

1212
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,655
Are completely blind

1213
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Think about how

1214
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,151
Free speech

1215
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:42,111
Foxes

1216
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,423
Most like a poem structure

1217
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,751
Content content

1218
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
It's okay it's not it's it's

1219
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,895
It's not

1220
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,735
Control it's almost like a DNA double helix

1221
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,831
It's the two argue

1222
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,183
Inextricably related

1223
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Is

1224
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
My girlfriend

1225
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Baby watched

1226
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,839
One night

1227
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,399
There was this

1228
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,191
They they go walking in a park

1229
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
Somewhere and there's all the sudden

1230
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,055
Very very conspicuous

1231
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
Ice cream guy

1232
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
Selling Halo top

1233
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Or whatever

1234
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,735
And they get two big things on the camera Zooms in on

1235
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Cut to break

1236
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,111
Halo top ice cream as a proud sponsor is like

1237
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
Too much

1238
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
Bad product placement

1239
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
I love

1240
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
I get up

1241
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:58,911
Co-product

1242
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
LG batteries

1243
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
So I saw pack

1244
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
So

1245
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
The argument

1246
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
I mean

1247
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,135
Emboldened by

1248
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Stories

1249
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
Antifa

1250
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
Paul Joseph Watson

1251
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
And has one

1252
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,679
Gender prediction

1253
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:37,823
That they lack of action on the

1254
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
People forget

1255
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
Weather Trump Administration

1256
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,887
Restaurants

1257
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,263
Is made in connection to

1258
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
Deplorable

1259
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,175
We all remember that deplorable

1260
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,599
The deplorable

1261
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,183
There was that Paul Joseph Watson is referencing a really dishonest

1262
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,999
Story about a man named Scott

1263
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:32,607
Who played guilty attack on the deplorable but two discussing one

1264
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703
Attack ready type of attack for that matter

1265
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
Is that is a fence

1266
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:43,103
So severe though that you just had to do 48 Hours of community service which after which

1267
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
So

1268
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,247
Federal terrorist

1269
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,807
Johnny was arrested because

1270
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,159
Keep it secretly recorded him discussing the idea of a quote-unquote acid attack

1271
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
Deplorable

1272
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
The conversation was about pulling the fire alarms and throwing a stink bomb

1273
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
By the way

1274
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,607
But of course

1275
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
Or some s*** why is it okay to jail

1276
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Replied it down

1277
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:13,823
Another one

1278
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
Disrupt j-20

1279
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,175
Which is a group is all about disrupting events surrounding the inaugural

1280
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
It's easy to paint them as being solely

1281
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,039
Trump as a group because Trump won

1282
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,879
The representatives has gone on record that they would have been just as Act

1283
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
Has Hillary won

1284
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
This is suspiciously absent

1285
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,743
Coverage of the group.

1286
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
I mean it's obvious

1287
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Because why

1288
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,471
The person they were talking to was a project veritas

1289
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,591
And that might be true it might not be but either way this is not evidence

1290
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
Anyone playing

1291
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Attack

1292
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,687
Trying to get that way only serves 14

1293
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,991
Exaggerate your side victim

1294
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
She's really sad

1295
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
Stuff that makes me real sad

1296
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Episode

1297
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,743
Journeys like I'm bummed out

1298
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Pathetic

1299
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,143
880

1300
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,423
Tubi

1301
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
I think quite literally threatened

1302
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
End with death

1303
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Buy this radio host

1304
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
And his

1305
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
You wait for that

1306
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,919
Wait wait for those feelings to really develop

1307
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,503
And then at the same time feel like they are

1308
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
So sad and pathetic

1309
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
It's not worth my time

1310
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
While at the same time no

1311
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,183
They are sad and pathetic

1312
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
And decided Satin

1313
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Pathetic as my only

1314
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
Make it more dangerous for you

1315
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
But yeah

1316
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:44,191
So a lot of appearances about have his guide the light of London Bridge

1317
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
Sure

1318
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,495
He is being sent

1319
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
2

1320
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
De-radicalization

1321
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
Training

1322
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,871
And being put on a watch

1323
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,479
In the UK who was the guy who

1324
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:01,087
Download the bridge and there's an ice pack going on charge terrorist

1325
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
Committed an act of heroic

1326
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Of how

1327
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,583
The hero would be painted as the terrorists

1328
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,143
Call Joseph

1329
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,239
You got this Royal lawn and who was the hero of the whole thing

1330
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
Always being poor

1331
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,087
So you wasn't even political

1332
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,207
You know what a lot of s***

1333
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
I'm not

1334
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
Save-A-Lot

1335
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:46,911
Watson's covering the story here about Roy larner the lion of London Bridge

1336
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,775
While it is true that easily call a selfless Act of heroic

1337
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Heroic

1338
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Have to get some sensitivity

1339
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,039
Is the terrorist is Muslim

1340
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,831
Which is what Paul Joseph Watson

1341
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,415
Also small point

1342
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,207
In his appearance says that larner charged

1343
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,255
The terrorist yelling that he was British

1344
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,815
Come on you can't do this

1345
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,911
Referencing his paper soccer

1346
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,727
He was drunk at a bar

1347
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,519
Before they attack

1348
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
I don't judge anybody

1349
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
Meteor

1350
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
A couple weeks before his act

1351
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,319
Photographer

1352
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
A foreign country

1353
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Who stinks like s***

1354
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
Before yelling National front

1355
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
I'm part of them

1356
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
Oh no Lovin no political

1357
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
I wear a lot of Reddit comments like discussing the situation and they're like oh my God

1358
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,055
Mike's Milwaukie

1359
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
You stalker rivalries are brutal

1360
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,199
Also after his altercation on the London Bridge

1361
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,759
Decided to drop by the

1362
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Coins

1363
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
Piece of s*** all Muslims are the same

1364
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Scum

1365
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
Alright

1366
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,631
Court he admitted the first was racially aggravated in the second was religiously

1367
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
You sentenced to 8 weeks

1368
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,543
Largely because of his high-profile is a bit of a hero

1369
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:32,127
He was however banned from dropping by his MP's office for two

1370
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
I like that

1371
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
Decorative don't come back

1372
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
There's a trend

1373
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,743
Absolutely it was a member of the national front

1374
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
Senses of racial and religiously basophils

1375
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
According to British

1376
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,423
In the present-day found to be in communication with

1377
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Extremist groups

1378
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,775
Radicalization

1379
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,407
I guess what the government in crochet

1380
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,991
Part of his plea deal in the whole racist islamophobic out

1381
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,831
Undergo anger-management Diversity Awareness course

1382
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,647
Any sentence wasn't suspended for a year

1383
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
That doesn't mean it went away

1384
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
It was suspended for a year

1385
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
Offense within that year

1386
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
Spend it

1387
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,399
Less than a year later he was busted with half a pound of amphetamines

1388
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
He was given another suspended

1389
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Remanded

1390
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,407
Rehab program

1391
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
Royal order has been given

1392
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Equallogic

1393
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:44,319
Do the status as a hero Society

1394
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
But that being said

1395
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,487
What is another chance

1396
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
The idea of going to

1397
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Training

1398
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,607
And being like

1399
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
Is Savin Hill

1400
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,423
Him from himself this is not a pun

1401
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,215
We are really

1402
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Look

1403
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,287
This is us being really great

1404
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:11,199
To lock up someone that has a heroic image

1405
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
Keeping up with the extreme

1406
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
With the

1407
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,111
Tendencies that you've already shown

1408
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,719
Oh man that sucks

1409
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,535
So like I said giving him a lot of chances

1410
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Because he's

1411
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
I think that's probably healthy

1412
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Foresight

1413
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,655
Belvedere trying

1414
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
Going out of their way to save

1415
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Soft

1416
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Because

1417
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,615
God that sucks so hard that you can like

1418
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,895
He's just

1419
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,455
F****** islamophobic monster

1420
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,759
Accidentally attacked

1421
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,039
At the right time

1422
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Play kids

1423
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,671
As almost every Muslim

1424
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,975
Study ever saw sooner or later one of

1425
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,791
I've actually bad

1426
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
And then he

1427
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,215
What are problems with the right-wing propaganda slick Paul Joseph Watson

1428
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,799
World and how they make their money

1429
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Complexity

1430
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,871
I won't have to be all good or all bad

1431
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,663
And that's just not realistic at all

1432
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,503
Just generally good people.

1433
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
Sometimes

1434
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:23,135
It's also the case that sometimes total piece of s*** rise to the levels of heroic when they're metal

1435
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:29,023
Staking everything on this guy being always being in the right because one time he was drunk

1436
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Bought the rights

1437
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
People seems like a bad way to

1438
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,799
I would have the wherewithal to

1439
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,591
To be able to do I hope

1440
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
That should I be tested

1441
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
In such a way I would rise to the occasion

1442
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:50,271
But I don't know

1443
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
I have no idea

1444
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
I'm impressed by

1445
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Now he's come to

1446
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
To the point of the episode

1447
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Goes wrong

1448
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,559
So before we were doing good

1449
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:03,839
Relative

1450
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Play Cowboy

1451
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
So

1452
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
It's interesting

1453
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
You don't know the

1454
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
The past and the present

1455
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Combine

1456
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
When we look at them

1457
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
I hate you

1458
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,223

Reminiscent

1462
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
To say

1463
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:39,423
Organization

1464
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823

But also start rounding up illegal aliens

1466
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,431
He's in the National Guard Franklin

1467
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,671

01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,463
So f***** up

1469
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,863
He's not supposed to believe that that's okay well obviously isn't supposed to be able

1470
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Everything he believes

1471
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:13,215
You should be against the idea of executive

1472
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,775
President federalizing the National Guard

1473
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
And taking them into

1474
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
Two states where the governor.

1475
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Want them to be

1476
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,175
Used for that purpose

1477
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,783
I posted literally everything you believe that Daddy's for it

1478
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,343
Stewart Rhodes

1479
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,135
First of all I got to say

01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
Crazy

1482
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743
Change the battery on a smok

1483
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
It keeps beeping

1484
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,583
The background it's driving me nuts

1485
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,935
Very small issue

1486
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,263
The interview and the problem

1487
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
It's there it's there that's the issue

1488
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103
Okay sure

Stewardess

1496
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,263
The president

1497
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Beef stew

1498
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
Declare

1499

Nebulously Define

Group of

1501
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,455
People who oppose fascism

1502
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,271
To be a terrorist group

1503
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,343
Needs to

1504
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
Federalizing National Guard

1505
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,975
Two left-leaning states

1506
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,791
In order to militarily suppress

1507
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,583
This a anti-fascist

1508
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,375
Counter-demonstrations

1509
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,215
Wichita

1510
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,799
Find out really glad we're going to kick him out of the country

1511
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,663
Profoundly f***** up on an object

1512
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
You still going

1513
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,759
Expect a s*** head

1514
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
But it's f****** crazy here

1515
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,391
Delivery is so monotone and

1516
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,695
Blase so matter-of-fact

1517
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
It's very f*****-up

1518
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
I'm put it as nothing

1519
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
On what's

1520
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Succumb

1521
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
As next clip

1522
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,887
You can't get more f***** up

1523
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
Portland

1524
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,567
Frozen Fox

1525
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,087
For 44 years.

1526
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,559
Aquarium

1527
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:52,447
Order to seal it in the National Guard

1528
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,871
And bring us in the service

1529
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:04,991
So when we were discussing

1530
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,575
How's your road.

1531
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,623
Largely a lot of his rhetoric

1532
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:16,511
It seemed to be about the idea of finding ways to justify being able to kill your political enemies

1533
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,815
Now six years later

1534
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
What do we do when our very next episode we find roads coming in and arguing to make him

1535
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,031
And his buddies the official militia

1536
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,079
To go in and with

1537
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Support of the state

1538
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:37,759
Go in and suppress the political activity of the people that they're opposed

1539
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,039
This is

1540
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
Next Level f*****-up

1541
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
Not only

1542
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,135
In-house

1543
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
Button how it's so confirm

1544
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,583
I feel like I feel like we just got

1545
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,655
Now I'm feeling like we are being dragged Along by

1546
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:01,055
Instead of in control of our own destiny

1547
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,895
Patrick Seitz being a certain way

1548
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,991
I was telling you earlier like 4 we started the show that I can barely sleep

1549
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
Part of the reason was

1550
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
Continues

1551
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
Cuz it gets

1552
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Worse

1553
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
It's so scary

1554
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,839
The seriously are agreeing with it or

1555
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Even if it's

1556
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
2000 people

1557
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,031
So that's terrifying

1558
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
But then also

1559
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,127
I'm with Adam Carolla used to call the great magnet

1560
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
The force

1561
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
The controls coincidences in the universe

1562
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
Step back in your life

1563
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,063
Wow that's weird

1564
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
This is so weird

1565
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,231
Episode

1566
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
I was editing a like

1567
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,815
Am I being a little am I too

1568
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
Stream bus Stewart

1569
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
But I know he's a f****** head

1570
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,959
Jumping to conclusions

1571
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
He's trying to

1572
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
Create justifications of

1573
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
Scenario to kill people

1574
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,383
Nope

1575
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,687
Came together to be like now.

1576
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,807
He has to know what that implies for the rest of the

1577
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,111
If if

1578
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,183
The suspension

1579
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
That is the end of democracy

1580
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,303
Think I care I don't think they care either I think that's

1581
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,327
The defeat

1582
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:31,167
That has to be what they're going for otherwise they would never advocate

1583
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,311
Stay and your political enemy then

1584
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
Had precedent that

1585
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Fine

1586
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,175
To organize and federalized the National Guard

1587
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
And send them in

1588
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
Terrorist

1589
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Organization

1590
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,087
Guess who the f*** they would be coming for an actual terrorist organization

1591
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:55,487
Transfer of power Everett

1592
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,839
The fascist groups that have ever been

1593
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
Caught making a Napalm bomb

1594
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,703
I can certainly think about

1595
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:09,311
So it's interesting that you're bringing that up

1596
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
I think they were they give a s***

1597
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,455
Not but I also think

1598
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
Democracy

1599
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,039
Sienna

1600
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,831
The the rules

1601
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,855
Timing of it

1602
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,903
As a necessary challenge

1603
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
But they need to get around

1604
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:59,487
Disabled

1605
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,791
Chabad.org

1606
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,887
What roads do this while Trump is still in

1607
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:10,751
Control the military because we are shot

1608
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
Being built

1609
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
Charge

1610
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
We don't they're going to steal the election

1611
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:23,040
Showing all their cards

1612
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
He's f*****

1613
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,256
Believe

1614
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,816
We worried about that possibility

1615
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,120
And this is the only way that they can get

1616
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
That the

1617
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
The train towards

1618
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
I don't know

1619
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,544
Ethnostate

1620
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,128
Or is Victor progress

1621
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,944
Continue a Justified

1622
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
Hey we'll get to that.

1623
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,088
Millions of illegal in California

1624
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,184
Completely insane

1625
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,744
Disseminated

1626
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:09,376
All the Judicial Watch found was that there was many is 1.59 billion an active voter

1627
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
On the California voter rolls

1628
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,008
This is nothing to do with illegal votes being cast there's no indication

1629
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
Judicial Watch

1630
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
Any of these people voted

1631
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,664
These are people who moved away or maybe they died

1632
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,944
I never sent it a note

1633
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
This to take them off of Motorola

1634
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:27,040
Probably because literally no one ever does

1635
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:32,416
California millions or more

1636
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,464
Illegal votes cast

1637
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,744
Absolutely

1638
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
These people are liars

1639
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
And they're lying because they want to kill p

1640
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,352
They don't want to miss

1641
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Just not fair

1642
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,472
Dan

1643
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
I think

1644
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,432
The rest of us

1645
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,480
I know

1646
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
Part of me that is

1647
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,112
This is true

1648
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,464
The way that my mind is wrapping itself around what's going on

1649
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Is like

1650
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,096
Immediately following the loss of the Civil War

1651
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
Like that

1652
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
The

1653
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,656
People in

1654
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
The Confederates alkyne

1655
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,704
Got together with

1656
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
Do you know what was the problem

1657
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
We didn't take the military with us when we left

1658
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,128
So what if we just had control of it and then tried

1659
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Like its

1660
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:30,016
You know that's it but it does have that field of like

1661
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:36,160
This is a group of people feeling like they have their chance to win the Civil War

1662
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
680

1663
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
In this next

1664
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,400
Flip Alex

1665
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Does what he always does

1666
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Which is the

1667
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
Expressway

1668
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Spy saying

1669
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,848
But it's

1670
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,384
Asphalt

1671
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,856
Evolution

1672
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:12,768
What was the last terrorist

1673
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:20,192
July parade

1674
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,288
Broken down

1675
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:28,128
Congress won't act as blocking president

1676
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,760
Crisis so it's it's

1677
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,368
It's the last fall I don't want this violent but I got to do it

1678
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,464
So it just makes clip Alex

1679
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Into what is

1680
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Is going to have

1681
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
And his conception

1682
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,120
Just for a little bit of a heads up

1683
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
Description of this clip

1684
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
This is

1685
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
So f***** up

1686
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936
Floor into a black

1687
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,520
A warlord state

1688
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,168
How to be really on wow I've never heard Alex sound

1689
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,520
And excited then talking about starving a city of people

1690
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,920
Quarantine Blues

1691
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Like

1692
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
Be fantasizing

1693
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,600
You think it's cocaine I think it's just getting us

1694
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,696
About the idea of terrorizing

1695
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:21,024
Millions

1696
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
Today

1697
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:25,120
Where you keep them in at gunpoint

1698
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,776
Did he steal all of this from Charles Manson pretty sure that's what I was saying was going to happen

1699
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,080
Cuz it's coming down today

1700
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Yeah

1701
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
Jesus

1702
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Helter Skelter

1703
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
So

1704
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,528
I knows it is already

1705
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Kind of reference

1706
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Best Buy

1707
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:47,648
Play talk about how this is going to happen

1708
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
Chris trumpism is tournament

1709
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,000
2020

1710
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,280
We have to do this

1711
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
When Trump is in charge

1712
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:12,224
Illegal alien

1713
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,600
U.s. military

1714
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
So he's saying that

1715
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:22,208
Federalizing the National Guard

1716
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,768
It starts ethnically cleanse

1717
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
What is what

1718
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,912
You know not as many words Maybe

1719
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:38,336
I know one guy

1720
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,128
Boardwalk yeah

1721
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:44,992
But like he's saying that if they do that then the last is going to start a civil war so f****** let's do it

1722
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:45,760
Right

1723
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:52,416
So somehow like when you're feeling sick and you just got to throw up

1724
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,440
You feel better afterwards

1725
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:57,024
Talk about a f******

1726
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,096
Describing it as a self defensive War

1727
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,912
Even though literally it is an offense

1728
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
DeVore

1729
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
From Trump

1730
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
What does

1731
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:13,152
Just federalizing the National Guard

1732
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:18,528
Gets really mad about that

1733
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,600
Chicken and egg

1734
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
Alright

1735
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,416
Atrocities are bad

1736
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Sure

1737
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,792
Chicken eggs

1738
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
So

1739
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,656
Top cigarette how to phrase it

1740
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
So you in the past

1741
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
Have expressed ideas

1742
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,104
That you know a lot of people probably wouldn't

1743
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,176
Except him losing in the 2020 election

1744
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:50,784
My position on that is I think that you are being a little extra

1745
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
Because I lived through Alex's rhetoric and I know that that was what he was saying about the Obama at the end of his second

1746
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,512
A bright it's kind of a sensational

1747
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,816
Claim the people make that I think of

1748
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
Kind of unfounded

1749
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:08,192
And looking forward to your hammer

1750
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,496
And I do think that's a dangerous

1751
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,032
Prediction to make

1752
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,568
I think it's unfair

1753
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
Generally speaking

1754
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,176
For the most part

1755
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:22,016
Except when we're talkin about Stewart Road ever go because he's very

1756
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,600
Bliss Italy in the sex clip

1757
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,928
We're not going to accept the results

1758
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
Will be in a civil war anyway

1759
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,384
Cute analogy

1760
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:55,040
If you have already used this Judicial Watch bulshit to lie to prove it

1761
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
We're going to steal an election

1762
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:01,696
Then no matter what if Trump loses you're going to say it was stolen

1763
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
If the election

1764
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,256
Stolen base

1765
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,864
We're going to start a civil war of trump loses the election

1766
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:14,496
All of this is dirt roads arguing if not now

1767
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
There's no time like the present

1768
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,896
Everybody Open Season

1769
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,432
But here's the thing

1770
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
Preemptive

1771
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
Because he knows that eventually

1772
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,320
He was going to kill somebody

1773
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,672
Concrete

1774
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,816
Already killed somebody

1775
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:44,448
Did you forget about your

1776
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
That was

1777
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
It's mental illness

1778
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:49,568
Is it

1779
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,176
It's not right

1780
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,736
At the same time

1781
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,160
Eventually they're going

1782
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,976
Kill somebody already

1783
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:12,864
Come on

1784
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,264
Stewart Rhodes quote Tim pool

1785
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
About something

1786
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
And makes

1787
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,104
War

1788
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,088
Preferably sucked up

1789
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,208
Yeah but I heard that clip the first time listening through my heart

1790
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
Sweater

1791
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,512
Like I got a real

1792
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
Sensitive

1793
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
Holyshit

1794
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,376
I can't believe we've reached a point

1795
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:20,192
Where someone who is the head

1796
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,728
Of an organization

1797
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,056
Of people who has terrorists within their work

1798
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,592
Absolutely

1799
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,152
The guy who is the head of the Oath Keepers

1800
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,712
Feels comfortable, not a program

1801
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:37,344
Talking about how we might as well do it now and then talking about

1802
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,672
A blase indifference almost the idea of killing p

1803
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
People in the streets

1804
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
Would we kill them

1805
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,768
I'm in the streets Belle Delphine

1806
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,304
That they were fighting against

1807
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
Fascist

1808
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,376
Do you hear yourself

1809
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
I don't understand

1810
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,752
That doesn't

1811
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,544
I get you're saying that that

1812
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
Sounds like something

1813
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,872
I get it

1814
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:06,272
I get why you would think that would you say that they will regret it whenever were murdering them in the streets

1815
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,552
For their political beliefs

1816
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,904
Now I get but

1817
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,976
Have you

1818
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,512
Let me give you a quote by Thomas

1819
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:19,328
Thomas Jefferson

1820
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,960
I cannot I cannot believe that

1821
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
Like that

1822
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
And I can't believe that I haven't heard Mediacom

1823
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
That's the day after this came out

1824
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,528
I have not heard anybody

1825
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,624
Casually discussing

1826
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,928
Starting a civil war immediately and

1827
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,256
Given graphic fantasies about murdering people in the

1828
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
The street

1829
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
It is

1830
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,376
So crazy

1831
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,424
How many people are members of Oak

1832
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
How many

1833
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984
People

1834
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Terrifying

1835
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Figure this

1836
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Especially when

1837
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
Part of that

1838
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,040
Like what he was really saying

1839
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
He hid it

1840
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,368
Really really close

1841
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
What are you talkin about how ants

1842
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
Jeep has mostly Young

1843
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
And white

1844
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
Yeah he's

1845
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,536
He said hate their own kind

1846
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
What you meant

1847
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
With hate their own

1848
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:31,520
There's a piece of that is what he meant all the way

1849
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
Sad sad eyes

1850
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,968
Very young white movement

1851
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,016
Old man

1852
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
Out of here

1853
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,416
A little bit and we realized

1854
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,720
Alex is still first

1855
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
Stand for boats

1856
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,768
Alex

1857
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,096
This is a revolution

1858
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,384
It always all roads lead to Rome

1859
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
As they say

1860
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
So

1861
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,480
It is next clip

1862
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
I think we just get more

1863
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Dirt roads being Ralph locked

1864
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:42,176
Do you even better

1865
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,712
We're done

1866
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,760
Wendell

1867
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:50,368
Political solution

1868
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,168
What's great here

1869
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
Because

1870
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
If

1871
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:08,800
Some media is to cover him a little bit

1872
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:15,456
Bun B Alex

1873
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,016
Explicitly saying that

1874
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,576
Agreeing with him

1875
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
What's going on

1876
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:30,048
Yeah Alex is All Things Considered acquitting himself fairly okay and not committing any

1877
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:36,448
Strongly disagree explicitly committed

1878
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
Stewart

1879
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
It's about the saying it yourself

1880
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,616
I understand that there's a difference probably legally

1881
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,384
Infatuated

1882
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:51,040
But intention lies behind your words

1883
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,064
I agree

1884
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,136
Which is the last one we have

1885
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,184
Stewart and then we just have one

1886
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,464
Palate cleanser after work

1887
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
They discuss Alex

1888
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,328
From Stuart to Scott's house

1889
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
It's going to get killed

1890
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,400
Them streets

1891
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,936
Comfort

1892
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,216
I don't think it is

1893
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
Oh okay

1894
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,488
Unintended consequence

1895
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
The ideas like politicians are also going to get it

1896
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:49,152
Something

1897
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:55,552
Something that happens every Civil War

1898
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,576
Cosmic Civil War

1899
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,280
They're really

1900
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Great job

1901
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
I'm sickened

1902
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,752
I am absolutely sickened by this rhetoric

1903
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,312
Put out

1904
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,872
I don't understand

1905
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
Anybody in good conscience

1906
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
Can do a show like this

1907
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
Like the idea that

1908
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,528
You can start with this

1909
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,904
Excessively over-the-top propaganda live a chemical weapons and milkshake

1910
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,744
To have Stewart Roads on your show

1911
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,536
To use what you've built

1912
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
In the first

1913
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:41,632
Hour-and-a-half of the shower so to come in and

1914
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:46,752
For a Civil War by the way we're going to kill journalist

1915
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,056
To ask for cuz they're the ones

1916
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,128
When they're really starting the Civil War

1917
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,944
It's insanely f***** up if people

1918
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
Take this seriously

1919
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,992
The danger

1920
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
Oven appearance

1921
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:03,136
The interview like that is impossible to overstate

1922
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,464
I pray that nothing happens

1923
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Pray that no one

1924
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,096
Is Inspire to action by this

1925
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:17,472
But these are two things make me really worried that Alex is trying to manifest

1926
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,496
The predictions

1927
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,056
He's making about the 4th of July parade

1928
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,848
Fourth of July rally

1929
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Trying to get

1930
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,176
People in a mind-state

1931
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,224
Where it is trigger happy

1932
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,040
Btime it's already the revolution is a revolution

1933
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
It better well

1934
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,648
Shot heard round the world happening on the 4th of July

1935
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:40,512
Perfect why not it's the stuff of books and movies solutely

1936
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
It's the stuff of movie

1937
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:46,912
It's dangerous this is so dangerous I don't know if it's illegal

1938
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,728
F****** feels like do you know who

1939
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,776
Explain best what it is

1940
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,056
He's trying to do

1941
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,104
Him

1942
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Whatever he's

1943
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,688
Describe what the left is trying to do

1944
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,600
They're trying to start a war but

1945
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,672
Jesus Christ

1946
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
Consistent

1947
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
Strategy

1948
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,304
F****** unfair

1949
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:17,376
Speaking of unfair what happens after this

1950
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,680
Alex has an interview with

1951
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,240
I don't know if you've heard of her

1952
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
But she's a racist 40

1953
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,288
Senior old do does

1954
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,616
Podcast will never

1955
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,384
Copperhead

1956
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,176
I think it's

1957
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,200
Disgrace

1958
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,992
To cover it

1959
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,088
Frankly and I have no interest in

1960
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,952
Critiquing the political views

1961
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
Of someone who still in

1962
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:49,120
There is something really disgraceful about Alex doing the show that he does

1963
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,168
And then having a 1450

1964
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Pedro

1965
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,984
Who says horrible things

1966
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,520
On his show as if

1967
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:56,800
Genexpert

1968
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,848
Like in the middle of the interview she

1969
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
She's complaining about her

1970
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,408
It's like

1971
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
That's not real

1972
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:06,016
I just don't know what to do with that

1973
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:08,064
So we're not going to cover it and it's

1974
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:08,832
It's not some

1975
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,856
Saratoga Lake

1976
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,952
I don't know how to put but I just can't I don't think I could

1977
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,256
Deal with my feelings that I would have

1978
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,048
About us spending any time

1979
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
So

1980
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,096
It is what it is

1981
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:20,864
It happened

1982
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
And

1983
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,656
I'm not talk

1984
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,960
Can handle it even like just

1985
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,240
Physically from of

1986
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,032
From a whiplash situation

1987
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
It's like

1988
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:33,152
Okay if Johnny Carson had gerbils on his neck

1989
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,712
It was a dog trainer and the dog

1990
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,480
Doolittle flip

1991
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
I just won't be able to handle

1992
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:42,368
About an hour.

1993
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,904
Little better

1994
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,440
And I wouldn't even bring it up to

1995
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,488
Today but it's not the first time the

1996
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
Jesus

1997
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:52,096
I didn't talk about it before cuz I felt like it was something

1998
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
Ignored

1999
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,960
But it looks like she's going to be a part of

2000
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,752
His stable now so I feel like

2001
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,080
I'll bring it up that it happened

2002
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:02,848
But

2003
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
Document

2004
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,152
If if

2005
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,688
It being a regular child

2006
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Star

2007
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Fox up your life

2008
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,808
Imagine being a racist forty-year-old YouTube

2009
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,904
Aspic part of it to like like I don't

2010
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,672
Think

2011
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,744
Like as terrible as number the things I've

2012
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
Over

2013
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
I don't

2014
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,632
Feel like it

2015
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Right

2016
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,472
For me is a 35 year-old to

2017
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,032
Take seriously the political views of

2018
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,312
14 year old

2019
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,848
Roar

2020
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,616
You like

2021
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,944
To imagine that they are

2022
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
Going to remain

2023
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,528
The same

2024
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:47,648
Should I be mad at those two girls who are in a deal Nazi band

2025
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,024
I don't know they grew up in there not.

2026
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
Anymore

2027
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
I don't I don't know what the right thing

2028
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,912
Things to do as night I just don't feel good about

2029
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,984
Yeah so anyway she's on who cares

2030
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,520
Now we won't last

2031
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Is Jordan

2032
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:09,152
In much the same way that I have a voice

2033
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,200
Your ideas about trumps

2034
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,808
Resist the urge

2035
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
To think that I would

2036
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,368
Listen to Archie

2037
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
However

2038
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,000
Alex brings up something

2039
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
That we've heard him talk

2040
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
A lot about

2041
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,328
In 2013

2042
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,376
But not so much in the present

2043
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:34,752
Is there a dead dog but it's something very specific

2044
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:41,408
There is no way

2045
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,504
They're on the winning team

2046
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:51,648
He's talking about liberals who go to college and get degrees

2047
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,440
By Design

2048
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,768
And the system once it catches you in a scam

2049
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Thousand dollars is it going to get 100,000

2050
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,176
I know you're jealous I'm getting money from

2051
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:25,184
Stopped yet

2052
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
Break up

2053
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:33,888
People's lives run off their husbands

2054
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:53,600
Hillary

2055
01:43:54,112 --> 01:44:00,256
I'm so glad to have you as a listener Alex if you're listening of yourself bye

2056
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,800
He's really hoping I mean obviously I don't

2057
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,824
This proves that he listen

2058
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,944
Where did that come from

2059
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,760
We literally talked about

2060
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:29,952
The episode before that like we talked about

2061
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:38,144
A couple of days off

2062
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:45,312
Jethro happens one of our episodes drops Auditorium

2063
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:50,176
I want. Emails but I definitely did the trick about

2064
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:58,112
100% totally desert

2065
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,648
You're part of the

2066
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
Knowledge fight

2067
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,560
Restart to INR numbers are going up

2068
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,960
To remember pieces of your rhetoric

2069
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:19,360
Forgotten about already you're trying to remember what you said about

2070
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,920
Nation of the lawsuits

2071
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,200
Is listening to our show just

2072
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:29,600
Turn it off

2073
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:40,864
It's just mind-blowing Chris rollercoaster of a day like this this one episode

2074
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,912
Buccaneer response

2075
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,936
Ansible nonsense

2076
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,984
Leading to the Civil War starting

2077
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
Let's go people in the

2078
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
The streets and then

2079
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,848
F****** the return to Prince well boobies

2080
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Mind-blowing

2081
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
Alex

2082
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,272
I don't know this is a real difficult

2083
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
Area like I don't

2084
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,904
I don't I don't know where you draw the line in terms

2085
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Pictures of like

2086
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
Farm datura

2087
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,512
But I think allowed to continue at the

2088
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:12,352
At the rate he's going at the trajectories going east

2089
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,656
I don't think there's any way around it

2090
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,448
I don't know how much

2091
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
That fits in with

2092
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:18,752
A robot

2093
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:22,080
Societal useful version free speech

2094
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,640
I don't want everything

2095
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,664
Do

2096
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,968
If things go bad

2097
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,760
It's important to remember

2098
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,040
But Alex made

2099
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:32,832
That's

2100
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,368
A very important

2101
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,928
That is very cool

2102
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,000
Does episode

2103
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,792
At all

2104
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
It was an emotional

2105
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Wreck trying

2106
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
Trying to get this all prepared

2107
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
I'm glad

2108
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
It's over

2109
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,800
Release of episodes

2110
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,592
I hate the

2111
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,872
The s*** I mean I like

2112
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,432
I like doing the show

2113
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:02,272
I hate this show in the present day

2114
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,344
I want the episodes

2115
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
He's still going to probably get

2116
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,160
People in

2117
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,184
In Greenbank

2118
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:16,608
Belltown in West Virginia

2119
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,912
About the telescope and how there's no phone

2120
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
Fine

2121
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,824
Episode 3 of Stuart roads in talking about the Civil War has to start before Trump leaves office

2122
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,432
Just because he's going to lose the election we can't accept that result then we won't have an opportunity

2123
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,736
To appear to be in the right

2124
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,016
Restart

2125
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
People

2126
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Stressed out

2127
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,856
Socially useless

2128
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,136
Corrosive

2129
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,160
Dangerous

2130
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,232
I think it's probably if not a crime

2131
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
Should be

2132
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,072
Like what he just did should be a

2133
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,448
It doesn't belong on the Arrow Toyota

2134
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,240
8 scribers

2135
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,504
You put

2136
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:14,720
That's the only way I realized

2137
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,024
Should be a heartbreaker

2138
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,328
That's just the end of the show

2139
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:22,400
So we'll be back on Friday hopefully

2140
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:28,800
The world doesn't band

2141
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:35,200
I don't know we might have to do a real late night recording

2142
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,736
We'll see what happens

2143
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,904
Twitter also

2144
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah

2145
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,976
Knowledge underscore fight

2146
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:50,560
Go to bed

2147
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,608
You can also download the podcast on ice

2148
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,912
Leave a review

2149
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
Could share the epi

2150
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,520
You could go to roh

2151
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,616
Usually a lot of people there like to show

2152
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,456
So we prefer if you go to a KOA

2153
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,480
You can

2154
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,760
Just kind of Mingle

2155
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,552
That's how that's our new marketing

2156
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,856
Sure

2157
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,696
I would say that

2158
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
Milkshake

2159
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,584
Probably has

2160
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,608
Is Alex Jones

2161
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:27,424
Holding

2162
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:33,056
Alex
