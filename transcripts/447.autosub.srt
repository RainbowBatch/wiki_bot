Who's kind of like a feeling that I have like I'm not going vegetarian or vegan or anything like that

25
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
Leaning a little bit

26
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Closer to that I want to do as I age

68
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
Casserole

69
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679

00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Thank you so much

73
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
Because arrows

Very much so

75
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,079
I'm done

76
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
I've heard a lot of do you remember so many inspirational comedians who said something like

77
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
You know what if you don't know where the B is

78
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Just push through it

79
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
Trust yourself in the B

80
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
Go to your parents house

81
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,719
Find the cabinet where they keep last year's Christmas paper

82
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,839
Rap-up that generosity

83
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,935
I'm not meant to do this

84
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
I can't think of

85
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Ways to wrap things

86
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
Figure out how to do this better

87
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183
Do Jordan of her get to the episode

88
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
Progress

89
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
You putting almond milk in yourself

90
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
10 what do you mean

91
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,895
Then we are officially 50%

92
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
So this is great progress

93
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Realizing two things

94
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
As I get in

95
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Into today's

96
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,695
Shelter update job the first is that I've been really sick and tired of everybody having the same first

97
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
Almost everybody has the same dance

98
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Burien

99
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
Everyone's got a grapefruit and none of them were good

100
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
I really am yearning for something different and some creativity a little bit of a slog

101
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Appreciating this week some like just playing

102
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Celtics

103
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
When you meeting sometimes you just like to go back to a nice Haagen-Dazs vanilla

104
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Refreshing

105
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Goodnight plain seltzer water 7 days before somebody's going to come out

106
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
Except

107
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,359
First time we started talking about Celtics

108
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
Concession and that was that I didn't

109
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Like Spindrift

110
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Right

111
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
I've tried a couple more Spindrift

112
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,599
Originally

113
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,159
I think I got the first ones that I tried

114
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,511
We're just some shity flavors but I've had a couple

115
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Remember exactly what it came in

116
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
57

117
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
Score

118
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
So congratulations Spindrift

119
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Lightning McQueen

120
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,479
Do not complement

121
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
For the Seltzer's

122
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
Today we're doing here

123
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:39,583
Episode because Alex was still out of the Steeler came back over the weekend

124
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Sunday

125
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,983
Some coverage of trump Rally from last night

126
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Oh

127
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
You questioned has Bill Hicks been doing shows ago

128
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
No

129
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,295
I'm guessing

130
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
I would imagine he has a lot to get an order with his house

131
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Was metaphorical house

132
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,023
Need to take care of business

133
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Maybe explain

134
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
That would not be really enough

135
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,031
For us to really Bank on being an episode the time we need to

136
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
It's a recording

137
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Today

138
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
I'd like to start off this episode with an explanation

139
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,807
About a month ago we started covering Bill Cooper's coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing

140
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,391
Which I had sincerely intended to become a running weekly investigation

141
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,535
I was so confident that we're going to keep moving forward

142
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
Which to this point has not been revealed

143
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Computer chip and a homeless man of our show not fair

144
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Confusion

145
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
I promised that mystery will be solved today

146
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
The issue was that

147
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Next week

148
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,295
Project

149
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Navigation to check in on that

150
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:16,095
As well as an interesting case study in how these different fields

151
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,471
The next week's open slot episode

152
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,871
I meant that was the week that the Police murdered George Floyd sparking protests in important

153
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Counter to what Alex wants to see in the world

154
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,271
It's critical that we keep a sharp eye on the present

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,391
And I know that conversation

156
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,255
Evolving situation protest

157
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
It would see it was important

158
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Chronicle

159
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
Was not necessarily as interesting

160
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,287
We had this conversation

161
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
It's going to be

162
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Probably

163
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Necessarily

164
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
Conversation

165
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
So I took on its own

166
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,719
Also threw those couple weeks I was trying to pick up a ton of my time

167
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
The contest was the product of multiple influences

168
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
The first was that Alex have been out of studio all week

169
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
The second was that I really needed something kind of like to discuss a recording just a few days after I move the nose still work

170
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
Not settling into this new place in Owens dumb push-up

171
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Contest fit that bill amazing

172
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
It is empty

173
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Probably rather Oklahoma City episode

174
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
Anything I want

175
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Yeah but I just couldn't

176
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
For a couple reasons

177
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
The first was a timer

178
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
Episodes

179
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
The second issue is probably more important

180
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
Bill Cooper's biography

181
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Horse Show focuses on Alex Jones

182
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,175
Who doesn't have a biography written about him

183
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
Seems strange to me I almost felt like cheating

184
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
I really enjoy the process of discovery becomes for having no idea what's going to come up and

185
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Learning as we go

186
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
That works all right with Alex

187
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
A big part of the story

188
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
They're important pieces of context in the biography of that I wouldn't

189
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Ever got

190
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Purpose listen to The Hour of the time

191
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
And those pieces of context

192
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Are pretty important

193
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
Seinfeld to be irresponsible for me to move forward and do another episode about Bill Cooper

194
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Without taking in Agra fee

195
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
This leads me to what I would want to

196
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Give is a

197
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Sort of

198
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Sizable

199
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Clarification

200
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
We were wrong

201
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
To give Bill the benefit of the doubt

202
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Violently abusive he was to like his wife

203
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
This among other Revelations have caused me to question my stance

204
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Some of the stuff in his personal life

205
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
The problem is

206
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
We're dealing almost

207
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Tremendous monster

208
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
We're so far below

209
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
General being a fair human being

210
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
It's simply because we speak about you on our show

211
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Chances are you should assume that they're the worst

212
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,455
Human being in the world maybe no maybe so

213
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
Of his life like he pushed

214
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Well

215
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Yeah

216
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
To which

217
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
He was

218
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
That is so rude

219
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,447
I don't know if we played

220
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
And I feel bad about that

221
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
You're wrong

222
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
I would like to know this stuff make it earlier

223
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
Overall I think that book

224
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Outright making accusations

225
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,583
Is there was just there was one piece of information

226
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Exploration

227
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
About Oklahoma City

228
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
Which I highly doubt I would have learned about some listening to build show

229
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Will get that down the road

230
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
And also the thing that maybe dance around my apartment

231
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
As we go through

232
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
I recommend that book very

233
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
It's pretty good

234
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
So I can start this off

235
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
We we left off

236
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,183
Couple days

237
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Call Bill Cooper head

238
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
Decided that it was false flag

239
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Trying to make Patriots look bad

240
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
Standard operating right-wing militia

241
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Narrative

242
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Pieces Of Eight

243
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Seismograph

244
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Misinterpreting

245
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,111
Misunderstandings about people who have died

246
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
There was another bomb

247
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
In the building

248
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
Just taking those things and use them as

249
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Definitive proof

250
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
Examples of interior saness

251
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Inclusion jumping

252
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
Games on April 24th

253
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
1995

254
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
I'm William Cooper in Georgia

255
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
City h

256
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Overtime

257
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Will have a much larger

258
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Herobrine

259
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Propaganda

260
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Ryan

261
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
Absolutely refuse to even talk to except

262
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
November

263
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Hugo

264
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
And I will continue that

265
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
They are

266
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Call

267
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
They have no moral values

268
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
I have no ethics

269
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm a certain ring

270
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Wouldn't know the truth if it kept them in the head

271
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,271
I'm sure he does a better job of censoring himself and not house

272
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Pretty remarkable

273
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Sing phenomenon that seems almost entirely

274
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Consistent which is terrifying tragedies in this country

275
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
Alex got a huge surge out of 911 denial and

276
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
After the Boston bombing

277
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
When he was yelling about it being a false flag

278
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,943
We've also seen him discuss lately Howie's covid-19 denialism

279
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,783
This makes some sense but it also says something really sad about people

280
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,391
It's scary to process things like a bombing or a virus outbreak of we crazy answers

281
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
There's no easy fix to its

282
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Becomes very appealing to listen to the person saying

283
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,887
The virus itself is no big deal

284
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,799
Domestic extremists is super terrifying because no matter how much the police

285
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,151
They'll never be able to uncover and stop every possible plot people may come up with

286
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
It's just a reassuring thought to believe that you know there's an evil cabal of globalist orchestrating

287
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
Taken care of

288
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,743
Yeah if you acted the reality that ultimately no one knows what's going on

289
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,631
The world is complete chaos and really you can bully a lot of people who think they're powerful into doing whatever it is

290
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
It's really terrifying

291
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,431
In times of Crisis these kinds of narratives are an attractive crotch to reach out for help and I'm depressed but not surprised

292
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Back in the times of Bill Cooper

293
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,111
It's unfortunate for the listeners because all they get is junk food narrative

294
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Is the mean nothing

295
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
I can go nowhere

296
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
But it's also bad for people like Bill and Alex

297
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
They were in the wrong lessons

298
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,631
Consciously or not that the nine tragedies Elizabeth drawers

299
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Which definitely has been a lesson that screwed Alex over

300
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
More than once

301
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
I personally

302
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Just immediately

303
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
That's that's

304
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
Lately I've been

305
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
Left and right

306
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Takes like

307
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Hey let's not kill

308
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Even know what you're wearing right

309
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Right now shirt

310
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Prove it

311
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
Major denial of things that are really scary you know providing easy answers

312
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Viable

313
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
Attractive

314
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
It's just

315
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
It's just sad

316
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
I mean

317
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
I don't know

318
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
It's a bummer but

319
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Is expected

320
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
I think it's I think it's really interesting

321
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Just because

322
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Deep down regardless of who like you can hate Authority or you can love Authority whomever may be in power

323
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
But what unites

324
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Most people is just that

325
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,871
I want to believe somebody is in chai

326
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,759
I want to believe an adult

327
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,831
Yeah

328
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:46,463
Is part of what's being exploited also like the way he is

329
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Like

330
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
On earned

331
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Confidence

332
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,215
Project themselves as I

333
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,103
I can tell you for sure there was two explosion

334
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
Weird

335
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,184
And that wouldn't draw need to speak Authority

336
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,584
False confidence

337
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Something nobody likes to hear it

338
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Let's wait until all the facts

339
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
The media

340
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Unicorn

341
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
Because they're actually titled CNN communist News Network

342
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
Initials for all

343
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
Organizations like

344
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
National broadcasting communist system

345
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,792
Like CVS of Communists broadcast service

346
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Communist

347
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Come on man

348
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Opportunity

349
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
You have the ugly mug

350
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
On the television Chris

351
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Somehow they think that work

352
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Losing all their Liberty

353
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
And of course

354
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
Really good and do what they're supposed to do

355
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,088
Marxist Socialist Party Line

356
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Someday

357
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
I hope they get

358
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
I hope it get it and I hope they get it

359
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
From the cars with their work

360
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
Looking for because they will live

361
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
Actually hope that don't really hope to forget it

362
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
Because if they do it mean the end of all of us

363
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
Women's art Liberty in the whole world goes down

364
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Open Chrome

365
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
That's just not true

366
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
We're going people left in the world

367
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
The right to keep and bear arms

368
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
That's also not true

369
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,264
But you know what I was thinking about because it's the monster

370
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Because of like what

371
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,872
His definition of right to bear arms

372
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Absolute right and Tails

373
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,720
What is the only country

374
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
No matter what the goal post will be already tell

375
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
I suspect that

376
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Squidbillies

377
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
Suspicious as the only country that can have guns

378
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
I can just see the first one

379
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Quincy

380
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
We're here.

381
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
I don't want you to know that knocking move

382
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Socialism

383
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
National

384
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
Nazi Germany

385
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Call Solis

386
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
That's right, you heard it right here

387
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Andres world

388
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,960
They're trying to turn everything around so that wrong is right and right is wrong

389
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
I don't know babe I think that anytime you hear someone say that said not to their socialist

390
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Its headline reading

391
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,808
Is socialism socialism

392
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
And obviously

393
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
Democratic is in the name of North Korea's Republic

394
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
Assume that they have the right to vote

395
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,216
This is Dinesh D'Souza levels

396
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,152
Somebody should not be listening to as reasonable as believing that Americans

397
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
A progress is interested in progress Orem

398
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
Zalima name

399
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
So

400
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,976
History of the reichstag fire

401
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
And sign

402
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm not interested in dating a lot of

403
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Certain issues

404
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
One of them is a reichstag fire

405
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
Like what

406
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
I don't care I will talk about that are about

407
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,736
I'm not recovering Oklahoma

408
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
It's

409
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
It's

410
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Great

411
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
Going immediately informed and global

412
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Is a communist

413
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Outrage

414
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
The Communist culprits have been erect

415
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Wow

416
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
Talk about

417
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Reminder ring ring

418
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,248
Vaporize in Oklahoma City

419
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
Identify

420
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Those who win today

421
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,672
Absolutely accurate photographic

422
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
Using wire server

423
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Procrit

424
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
So like I said he's in the middle of reading basically an essay one of his listeners wrote about the reichstag fire

425
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
Realizing gears compare that

426
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Situation with the Oklahoma City bombing

427
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
What great did it

428
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,248
And he's not a hard

429
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,600
Are you providing content

430
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
So bill seems to bring up two specific complaint

431
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,144
Axial which led to the Ryder truck

432
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
The story about the axle is actually pretty interesting

433
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,080
I didn't find corroborating information about that

434
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,736
There's an indie online piece from earlier this year

435
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Looking back on

436
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
25 years later

437
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,440
Munchkin was 19 years old when he assisted in the response to the Murrah building and you'll find this

438
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,840
Insight truck axle in the middle of the road

439
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
12 hours later as he walked back

440
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Investigators were circling the Excellence

441
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
He later learned that it was from the Ryder truck loaded with

442
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Explosives

443
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
This firefighter

444
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
The axle which could have been from another car in the area whatever

445
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Nina

446
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
It's not weird at all really that a destructive bomb could discharge something like a truck axle

447
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll come on man

448
00:27:53,984 --> 00:28:00,128
Soundrop

449
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,320
Disintegrated or something

450
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,672
In the real world this Axel was found and traced to a Ryder truck

451
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,000
Which then led to a specific location

452
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,864
The employee of the truck shop gave the FBI information and descriptions

453
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,448
Sketch

454
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,544
Ultimately finding a hotel where the staff

455
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,664
Because this was required

456
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
Timothy McVeigh had already been arrested at this point

457
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:42,880
Even pulled over by a State Trooper 90 minutes after the bombing approximately 80 miles north of Oklahoma City

458
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,440
About where you'd expect

459
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,328
About to stop the right to

460
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Mexico without my Turbo clear

461
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,784
It's pretty remarkable how quickly

462
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Supra seemingly unrelated charge

463
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
But none of that

464
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,696
The timing and causality the vents makes total sense

465
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,280
Sumter SC stronger argument

466
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
But this is a new world order

467
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
You can yell about like they found the guy so quick it's like the reichstag however communism

468
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,104
It's not necessarily the same thing at all just feel like everyone

469
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
When you go through this story unlike so many others

470
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
It does feel like everybody's acting almost

471
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Reasonably

472
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,624
You know like there's nobody who's doing something absolutely insane on the side anytime you read about

473
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
But he's like he bombed the Federal Building

474
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,496
Let's get Round the Clock

475
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,312
Certain if you look far enough you can find

476
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Probably some example Arkansas

477
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:13,248
Timothy McVeigh

478
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
Siri right there

479
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
I mean

480
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Did the disease

481
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,888
Flimsy

482
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
It's just no good

483
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
It is is unearned

484
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
Eddie goes on because he talks about the mode

485
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
Control from 250

486
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
Model clear majority

487
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,992
We could Wipe Out the critical 120

488
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
He would win his title

489
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
CorePower

490
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Roxy Authority could already waited

491
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Call Rita

492
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
The quarters

493
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Permanent party and bull

494
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
The Commons in Revolutionary conspiracy

495
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
Think of something else

496
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,264
Because of date for a 19

497
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Was

498
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Cockroaches

499
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Burn

500
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
The right stuff

501
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Control

502
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Germany

503
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
You know the rest

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
And the same thing

505
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Your carpeting here

506
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Now

507
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
This argument is

508
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,472
Yeah it's the result of Desperately straining to make connection

509
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Between historical events

510
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Present circumstance

511
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,432
It's one thing to say that Hitler blame the reichstag fire on Communists in order to solidify his power and demonize is

512
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,784
What is a completely different

513
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,904
Bill Clinton became president in 1992 and was up for reelection in 96

514
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
After the 94 midterm elections

515
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Control of boat

516
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,120
House and Senate so presume

517
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,960
Is it Bill Clinton was trying to blame the OKC bombing

518
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Control of Congress

519
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
In the 1996 election

520
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,944
This did not happen

521
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Governorship

522
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,576
Around the country it's always nice to remember our political system

523
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
Today that once we were allowing

524
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
With power

525
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Which is a terrible

526
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
Bright

527
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
New

528
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Narratives like the one bill is putting forth your sound good if you're looking for a way to blame for everything

529
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
You have to take a step back

530
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,808
Things that should happen if Bill Cooper is Right ever happen

531
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,952
Use OKC to bring in a socialist dictatorship

532
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
Disco

533
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,816
Did you lead you to question the conclusion

534
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,144
He's just talkingshit here's my problem

535
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
With his internal

536
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Project

537
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,800
If if he's painting the the Nazis as a socialist

538
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Regime

539
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,664
With as he would call it a Marxist socialist Doctrine

540
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
Hitler trying to get rid of

541
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
Instead of a line with

542
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
I don't think I follow

543
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Well he's saying that

544
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
That Hitler

545
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,792
Right consider is Marxism and socialism to be

546
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
This is the same

547
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
So why is it that Hitler hate

548
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
In his

549
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
Worldview where in Hitler is also a communist

550
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
Would it be possible to just like wrangling in and be like hey we're getting the Communist system and they're like

551
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:00,576
When he's like or I'll kill you in there like

552
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,648
No answer for the

553
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,208
Yeah yeah

554
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
Could you saying that Hitler

555
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
You got to get rid of them

556
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
To take over

557
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Right

558
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,568
Doctor's appointment

559
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
You know enter these people's minds

560
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
Insta understand

561
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
He would say that

562
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
Actually

563
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
The same

564
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,424
Be against each other

565
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Alex would say

566
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,544
But I don't know if

567
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
Contradictory

568
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
I got nothing for you man

569
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
So there's not a whole lot of development of the storyline of the OKC bombing

570
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
Mercy on this episode

571
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:13,280
Just mostly continuation on this 24th we see him continue to talk about

572
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
The seismograph

573
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Sunday Soundwave

574
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
So there's no mistake and I'm not making it.

575
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Ladies gentlemen

576
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
I don't care

577
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
The government shares

578
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
You are clearly

579
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Separate

580
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
Both of the same magnitude in the same direction

581
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Pardoned by Kim

582
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
10

583
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,096
It clearly shows of how to read this shows up a trainer test close to

584
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Normal traffic

585
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Party traffic

586
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
And then the two

587
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Two separate

588
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Understand

589
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Frozen

590
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Not Echo

591
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Murphy tractor loser

592
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
The Oklahoman

593
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Geological Survey

594
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
Sarkeys Energy Center

595
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
University of Oklahoma

596
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Norman Oklahoma

597
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Received

598
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Information on the 21st

599
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Call April at 1:20

600
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Thanks for the timestamp

601
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Warriors and teenager

602
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Communist News Network

603
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Why aren't you recording me

604
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:38,272
To clarify the media is not covering this because bills misrepresenting this information not because the media is like

605
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
The Oklahoman reached out to doctor can lose to get a comment about the

606
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
Is Cabela's going on and on

607
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
And from the article in the Oklahoman

608
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:52,352
Recorded on the seismograph

609
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
Action which you refer to as a refraction esta

610
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,984
From the explosion at the federal building in Oklahoma City

611
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
He said the reading could have also come from a quarry blast

612
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Loser describe the waves

613
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
Detective Norman is surface wave

614
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,968
Eastside without seismographic readings from two other locations

615
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
Geologist cannot determine where the waves came from

616
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
Sounds like the government is lying to you sure this mystery is solved eventually as we discuss our last episode

617
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Haven't got comment from Doctor loser

618
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,864
The Oklahoman

619
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
Which was predictable

620
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,896
Until you learn how to print the proof

621
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
God dammit

622
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,552
Piece of information

623
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Proof of multiple

624
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Is not true

625
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:01,472
Yeah it's the next refraction and I'm going to need the confirmation

626
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
From two other sources

627
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,920
The government is f****** I don't care where's government

628
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,016
Tell this person who listens to Cooper Stadium show on emails

629
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Constantly

630
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
The only thing that makes sense to me

631
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
Another tender

632
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Spirits in here

633
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Very

634
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Senior supervisor

635
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
Email we're not at work that day

636
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
We're not at work

637
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Why

638
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Who Warren G

639
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
What the f*** is this

640
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
Doesn't mean anything

641
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,464
How many people is talking about not being at work

642
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
He calls them senior supervisors butts a supervisors

643
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
No specific

644
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
Pictures of agency

645
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Well I mean they were important

646
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Senior advisors

647
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Account of they Worthy

648
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
How do we keep this building from being bombed

649
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
Others so that they were missing

650
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
That's the one that's the one that's going to do it

651
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,856
How can someone who pretends to be a justifacts

652
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
Investigate and report that a nonspecific number of senior supervisors for an unspecified agency

653
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Bombing

654
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,080
Unit we go ahead and assume that an uncommon number of Supervisors were not in the building when the bomb went off

655
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,896
How can Bill prove that someone had to have worn them

656
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,480
Is it not possible that some of them might have been in the field or on assignment

657
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,320
Is it not possible that some bite of called into work sick that day

658
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
There's a ton of possibilities the bills just completely ignore it because it's

659
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
Conclusion has already been reached

660
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:03,072
And the process of reporting on this story only exist to serve the goal of solidify

661
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,168
Bill Cooper basically cosplay to the guy who's looking for the truth

662
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Sometimes it manifested

663
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
It's like when you scold his listeners for bringing up unfounded nonsense

664
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
Reality

665
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
Those are not instances of him caring about the truth

666
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:22,016
When do schools have collars for bring up rumors that's really just in expressing his authority over the audience

667
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
It's it's

668
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Research

669
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
When he passes long rumors

670
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
But it's abhorrent

671
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
Stupid when I do the same thing

672
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
It's basically called m.

673
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,048
Where to send for you to do something that's a virtue for me

674
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Yeah

675
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
It's messed up

676
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
Christine controlling

677
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
What the truth

678
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
You know it is it is nothing to do with

679
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,432
Searching for anything it has everything to do with being like

680
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
This is concrete yeah and I know it

681
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,064
It's kind of like setting the terms of the search itself

682
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Absolutely

683
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,160
We can have disagreements

684
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Very small surface levels

685
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
But if you come at me with

686
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
Anything like a

687
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
It's not false flag

688
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Kill you

689
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Doing the same bulshit I do

690
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Communist news

691
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Haha

692
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,616
Bill discusses the arrest

693
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Timothy McVeigh

694
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
And this is

695
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
This is messed up stuff

696
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Grolier

697
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Bert

698
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
Cherried out

699
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Cheryl Carney

700
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,464
And her beautiful country

701
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
In a car with no license

702
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
Music

703
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
The point where

704
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Not to get caught

705
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,384
He doesn't have a license

706
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
105 the car

707
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
Is a concealed weapon

708
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
You got hard

709
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,143
Attempt to get away made no attempt to shoot the officer

710
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
Blowing up a building full of people

711
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
There's no expiration year

712
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
So first of all bills games here about the idea that if a weapon is concealed to be impossible for a cop to see it

713
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,039
Ridiculous

714
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Kind of embarrassing

715
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
It's an indication of

716
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,695
It's a Denny's just trying to cast out and make the arrests

717
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,303
There's something interesting going on here with bills claim that you know

718
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
It's weird that he didn't try and kill the

719
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
The police officer that tried to kill him

720
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,751
It's a little weird kind of thing that you expect

721
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
Text someone to do

722
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Weird

723
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
6 years after the bombing

724
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
The meeting ended Oklahoma City

725
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
Conversation

726
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
Was what should McVey he's pulled over by the

727
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Police

728
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,303
Quote just take the ticket and go on your way with the advisement

729
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Do what you replied quotes

730
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
You don't think I should shoot them

731
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
This was rebuffed

732
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
Why would you shoot someone over a ticket

733
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
That right-wing figure was Bill Cooper

734
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
F*** out of

735
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Oklahoma City bombing

736
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
Possession of a bunch

737
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Copies of the Turner Diaries

738
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
To quote watch Oklahoma City

739
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,447
According to Bill Zone telling the story

740
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
I mean I could see him

741
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,079
You know narcissistically inserting himself into the story

742
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
But also that's

743
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Deeply

744
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Deeply fought

745
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
Yeah this

746
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
Inserting yourself into the story

747
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:14,207
I don't know

748
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Screw

749
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:20,607
Associated been traveling on I-40 when they decided to stop in at Surplus and stuff

750
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
The owner which was a

751
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
Friend of Bill

752
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Name two aspirin

753
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
According to Pale Horse Rider

754
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,335
Lesperance asked them if they'd ever heard of Bill Cooper

755
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
Sure they had the two men said Uber was their favorite

756
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,455
They listen to him all the time

757
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,831
Lesperance Doberman

758
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,647
Eventually investigators learned that another May

759
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
The plot to blow up

760
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
The conspiracy before it came to fruition

761
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,935
Horse rider includes a passage from an interview that Michael Fortier did in August 1995

762
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
With an outlet called The Outpost of freedom

763
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:06,175
40 hour later served as the state's star Witness

764
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
Frances Farmer

765
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Well for your side

766
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,367
I can't say a whole lot and red thing

767
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,207
There's this guy with a radio station in Arizona

768
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
He kept calling people sheep

769
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,143
Well we got to thinking that's right to change

770
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Tim really respond

771
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Get to that

772
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,007
Bill's Work of trying to build up

773
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:37,919
Timothy McVeigh

774
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
That he knows fully well he's

775
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Part of what inspired the bomb

776
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,367
This is basically the same understand

777
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,279
Well this is certainly not a universal thing a lot of conspiracy theory operates as a way to cover up the unpleasant

778
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Community

779
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
You don't want to recognize and accept our real

780
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
And ignore white supremacist operates on

781
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,639
White identity level that has a possibility of inspiring such a

782
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,503
Similarly he knows that his extremist gun absolutist renrick requires him to come up with

783
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,063
Conspiracy theories every time there's a mass shooting

784
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,671
The reality of mass shootings at white supremacist violence are threatening to Alex's world

785
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
You can

786
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
It's the globalist somebody up

787
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
It's mind control

788
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
And in the same way

789
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,383
Could have bomba Federal Building and killed tons of people

790
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,479
It's the ugly conclusion of the rhetoric of these put out at Bill knows that

791
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
So this requires a conspiracy

792
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Yeah that's

793
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
I can't

794
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
I can't believe that

795
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
I could not live with

796
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
Like the idea that you could just go on with

797
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Your show and

798
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
Just use denial just basic denial

799
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
With the full awareness bed

800
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
This guy you knew this guy

801
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
Lolita

802
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,479
Maybe Bill wouldn't realize

803
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
That this is the guy

804
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
Forever

805
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:28,255
Story of meeting today until a few years later

806
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Bill's influence

807
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,631
Timothy McVeigh could have shopping

808
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:39,007
Because he was just pulled over for missing a plate and is Bill Cooper

809
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
Why kill someone over a ticket

810
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,871
And here on erbil is baffled by the decision

811
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,199
But he very well might have advised Timothy McVeigh to make

812
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,783
And is using that decision is proof

813
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
Cuz if you was

814
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
You would have tried to kill the cop

815
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Whoa

816
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Man

817
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Man

818
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,583
Inadvertently inspiring

819
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Is a very strange

820
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
Existence

821
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
Yeah that is before we can

822
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Oh man

823
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
Episode

824
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
That

825
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
We got to get to work maybe dance around the apartment

826
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
My town

827
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
Larry Nichols

828
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
Call Jasmine KHOW

829
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,375
Argenta fide one of the suspects from the artist drawing that either Brown

830
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Call Boyd

831
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
Neither Arkansas

832
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
You mean Arkansas

833
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Hillary Clinton real

834
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,455
My information is that you've already told I didn't Secret

835
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
To the public sometime within the next week

836
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
Yeah brother Nicholas isn't play

837
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,671
Bucking roller coaster ride

838
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
Larry Nichols is in place

839
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Of course

840
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
Qanon Hillary Clinton has already been secretly indicted nothing ever changes

841
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,799
I want to drive home looking at this covered

842
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,895
It's less sophisticated in terms of the the radio

843
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,527
You know where is a lot of the propaganda so much more media Savvy now

844
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
How much is it

845
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Exactly the same

846
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,927
Tricks how you can sell it over and over and over

847
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,095
Larry Nichols and

848
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:46,751
Be smart enough to not trust Larry but as it turns out they said

849
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:51,103
Whatever they say Larry Nichols entire career

850
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
Just like finding people who hate

851
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,967
The clintons to believe him now

852
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,367
Back in the 90s there wasn't

853
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Awesome

854
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,743
Because it allows you to laugh at pretty much everyone who took him seriously

855
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
Unreal

856
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:15,423
Also because this is

857
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,983
Resurrection social media

858
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Not just

859
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
The qanon

860
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Pacifica

861
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,151
About

862
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:32,575
The clintons at the time where the middle of the Whitewater scandal

863
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Indicted

864
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,231
Post this was spread by a guy named Sherman skolnick

865
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
A contributor at the

866
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Conspiracy Nation newsletter

867
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,959
Convinced that either Clinton's Financial supporters or someone in the government ordered the bombing to obscure the fact

868
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
The two days earlier

869
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,055
Hillary Rodham Clinton was indicted on two felony counts

870
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
In the Whitewater Pro

871
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,663
Secret indictments are kind of standard tropism

872
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,247
Conspiracy as you can see from the present and from the mid-90s

873
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,087
They're an appealing angle because there is such a thing as a sealed indictment

874
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
So you can craft

875
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
That just like truth

876
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
The people yeah I'm waiting to find out

877
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,815
Tucking Xerxes is son secretly indicted

878
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
God sakes

879
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,167
It's always cylinder apps is

880
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,687
This is just another weak attempt on Bill Cooper's BART to do anything he can to take the blame off his big fan

881
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,575
Brings us to the end of the 24th

882
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,159
Turn on the 25th

883
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Batman

884
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
This was not a good

885
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
So it wouldn't be very good

886
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,215
No callers

887
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
The 25th

888
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Rambling about militia

889
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,991
Char Char

890
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
How do you say these are militiamen

891
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
For the record for the Oklahoma City bombing

892
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
Open card

893
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
Have not been slide

894
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,999
Have not been found guilty of anything

895
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
I'm in this country

896
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
You are innocent until proven guilty

897
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
Unless you're Hillary which has you're already

898
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
None of them

899
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
Have been

900
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,103
Or ever will be

901
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
Connected to any Melissa

902
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
They're not Melissa money they're not thank you

903
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,623
It's fair enough to point proven guilty

904
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
You should come down to the back of the

905
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,535
It's pretty obvious

906
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
The bombing

907
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,399
You didn't care what the process of law even after your approval

908
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,007
Does using the idea of innocent until proven guilty is awaiting says that they are in fact

909
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,847
It may be the case with Timothy McVeigh was not a formal member of his

910
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,687
Specific militia but that doesn't mean he's not a creature of the same world

911
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,063
According to chose the Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols attended meetings of the Michigan militia

912
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,903
There is an L Norman Olson told the Associated Press

913
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,695
These people were told to leave

914
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
Because that kind of talk

915
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Destruction

916
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Terrorism

917
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:25,631
Is naturally the kind of thing that makes sense to say after someone Bob Federal Building

918
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
However you may sound a little different beforehand

919
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,263
Michigan life pointed out that a year

920
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
Before the bombing Norman Olson told her recruit

921
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Meant meeting

922
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,687
If this country doesn't change armed conflict is inevitable

923
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
This is how it goes

924
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
You bringing disaffected Angry Young Man with talk of armed conflict that denies anything to do with that when they fall

925
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Follow through with those words

926
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,511
This is a pattern that you see in right-wing propaganda to pretty much across-the-board

927
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,631
Infowars interviews Jack pasovic about how scary, ping-pong Pizza is

928
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
How it works

929
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
Are more meaningful

930
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,663
Back to McVay

931
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
His beliefs lined up almost

932
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,783
Entirely with the beliefs of right-wing militias at the time

933
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:19,647
It was largely government actions

934
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
All right-wing militias

935
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,511
Almost identical politics

936
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:32,191
Malicious calls back to history

937
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,751
I prefer to call them Civil War pre and actor

938
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Like there

939
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
They're just as lame as Civil War

940
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Happened yet

941
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:46,783
Erase your earlier bad shape.

942
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:52,671
Episode

943
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,279
And this is where I'm totally convinced Bill knows that this is the guy that he had met

944
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,863
Investigator

945
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Timothy McVeigh

946
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,263
Volunteer any mind-control operation

947
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
United States Army

948
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Landed with a micro computer chip

949
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Hey

950
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Antonio's Craigslist

951
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,039
Ever since he left the United States Army

952
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
And nobody has lived

953
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,767
Even playing for the United States Army could follow him by electronic surveillance where he was all the time

954
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,607
Weird the bills bringing up this idea that means they had a chip

955
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,727
Because this

956
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
From Pale Horse Rider

957
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,175
He also had a computer chip implanted in his body he said

958
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
Cooper can touch it if you wanted to

959
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
It was in his right butt cheek

960
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,319
Confirm it was there

961
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
I decline for obvious reasons Cooper set

962
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
To see if there was something there

963
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:09,471
According to Bill Cooper Zone telling himself to his ass

964
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Possibility

965
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:18,431
What is a bill has reporting things

966
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Information came from

967
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
Because he know that

968
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,319
Then he'd like if it were known that he'd met with the Oklahoma

969
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Bomber

970
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,671
Who is in the process

971
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,231
Defender guy

972
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
I listen nobody Timothy McVeigh over here he had a computer chip in his ass and I wouldn't touch his ass because

973
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
Cuz obvious reasons

974
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,711
Obviously true

975
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:56,319
The other is at Bill's liquor store totally made-up

976
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
Associated Press

977
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:02,975
Reported by Timothy McVeigh

978
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
Prior to this episode

979
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:10,655
Everything in Bill's story of the meeting is just

980
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,007
Turner Diaries detail the microchip Oklahoma City

981
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
That could all be Bill creating a tall tale

982
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Whatever the case

983
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
Michael 40 years interview where he discussed how Timothy McVeigh really responded to Bill Cooper's talked about how people needed to actually

984
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Do something

985
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,855
Not filtered through bill

986
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,415
And that's it could be taking over more seriously

987
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,487
Bill Maher

988
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
But he definitely inspired

989
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
That's the conclusion

990
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
That you really

991
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
I can't shake

992
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
It's the only

993
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,775
Believing bill story

994
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
About meeting tip

995
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
McVeigh is f***** up

996
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,967
If it's not true and he's making that up

997
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
What is that

998
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Yeah exactly

999
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Either way

1000
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
What cuz if you're Mickey

1001
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
I want credit

1002
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,743
Which means

1003
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
The militias respect what he did

1004
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
Which means

1005
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:15,423
All of my lies about how it's not malicious

1006
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Right

1007
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,287
That is another

1008
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:25,151
So we get in here we're going to about to jump to the 26th but like I said

1009
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
This episode on the 25th

1010
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:33,087
Militias are

1011
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,743
People suddenly being a bit curious about what's going on

1012
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,911
I found myself zoning out almost entirely as bill went on and on about how if you're an Able Body person in Arizona between

1013
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,519
Ages of 1845

1014
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,359
Who's all just stuff that I couldn't get myself to care about because even if that's

1015
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
It's technically true according to the Arizona

1016
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Constitution

1017
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,015
Who cares what does that mean today probably not

1018
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
Most likely

1019
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,719
The Illinois militia

1020
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Let me say this right now

1021
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
They don't need

1022
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Draft

1023
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,871
I don't know about this

1024
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
I don't care

1025
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
I just booked

1026
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:39,135
CNN by the way

1027
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Everybody's going to fight

1028
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:48,095
Tomorrow you're all going to show up at the

1029
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,215
Start at the 26th

1030
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Gentleman

1031
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
Everything the trust

1032
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,591
Hudson warned you about

1033
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407

1034
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
It have been mine

1035
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
Green

1036
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
My purpose

1037
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,535
Green armor done

1038
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
Jackie Chan

1039
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
California

1040
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
Riverfront on cell

1041
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,359
Try to convince

1042
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,735
Summer Happening by waking enough people

1043
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Permit right here way of

1044
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,343
Numbers of

1045
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Educated awake

1046
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
Marquis

1047
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
People

1048
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
Olive Garden

1049
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,751
Overwhelming

1050
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
Somehow

1051
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,127
You should

1052
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
I really don't know what to do about

1053
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Step 2

1054
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,783
Kenyan Camaro too

1055
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
Try to

1056
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Help bring

1057
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,951
Virtual Revolution by hooker

1058
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,743
Interesting

1059
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,327
Just recently saw

1060
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,143
As the Coronavirus

1061
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,447
Covid-19 stop

1062
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Started

1063
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
To become

1064
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
More

1065
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:36,127
Outside of his narratives I guess I'm more real than his narrative

1066
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
A lot of tacos

1067
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
We lost this

1068
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,223
The globalist

1069
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Kind of

1070
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
Similar response to Bill after

1071
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
Like realizing

1072
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,791
Is going to be proven to be guilty of this

1073
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Oh boy

1074
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,935
Interesting see like after a crisis point

1075
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
Point after really big things

1076
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,823
Maybe beyond your abilities to spinner to make

1077
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Alright

1078
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,127
You realize I say

1079
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
Yard sale

1080
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,991
These guys it's strange

1081
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
Because

1082
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,367
Kind of their way of taking responsibility for it

1083
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,695
Absolutely not taking any responsibility for what he

1084
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
Happened

1085
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,535
Responsibility for something that is 100

1086
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
You know like

1087
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,655
I am so sorry Lost Boy

1088
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
Yeah I would like

1089
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,719
Or whatever to process

1090
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
So

1091
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,863
Come to realize as I listened to more and more available show is that

1092
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,703
Information-gathering process

1093
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:10,591
Is almost entirely just messages that he gets from listener

1094
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
This is wonderful

1095
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,943
Report everything

1096
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,527
Pharmacy in Oklahoma City

1097
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
I heard you

1098
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
Somewhere else

1099
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,463
Please find someone else ripping Cena

1100
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
Circle Public Radio

1101
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
All Things Considered

1102
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Even show the grave

1103
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,655
Make sure that I am mistaken about this I hope

1104
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
I am wrong

1105
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:40,799
I thought I heard a professor from George Washington University

1106
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,847
Redeem weird about this

1107
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383
Closing of tape

1108
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,223
Bring that we would have to choose between keeping

1109
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
Parking our freedom of

1110
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
And having freedom from terrorism

1111
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,183
This is such a great manifestation of how bad this operation is

1112
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:02,815
Intelligence operation of the Second Continental

1113
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,167
He has the citizens agency of joint intelligence or

1114
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Angie

1115
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,727
Which serves as data-gathering

1116
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,335
Just as listeners who paid him send an email

1117
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Report

1118
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,687
And here you can see the quality of the work is being done by his station

1119
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,783
Who's emailed Bill to complain about something

1120
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
MPR

1121
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
Something she

1122
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,647
Thinks she her.

1123
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,463
Dream that Obama was President

1124
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
Could you could somebody please confirm

1125
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,095
I would like at least my

1126
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,935
Operation This American Life

1127
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:47,615
Build Oklahoma Station cheap

1128
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:52,479
General training in journalism or intelligence-gathering being a ballet instructor by trade

1129
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,295
More like Bill Cooper so she paid her dues

1130
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,879
Signed an oath of allegiance to the second continental army of the Republic

1131
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,487
And was named a second Lieutenant of the intelligence service under Bill

1132
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,535
Tauc ball

1133
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,959
Commission papers the general was listed as George Washington

1134
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:17,311
You kind of get this a bill was running the entire second continental army of the Republic

1135
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,359
And pretending there was a chain of command

1136
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,407
More cosplay

1137
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
The ghosts of Georgia

1138
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
More would go on to ready

1139
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:29,599
640 page book called Oklahoma City

1140
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Herpes

1141
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:36,511
It was going to definitively prove all these conspiracies based on thorough documentation of media lies blast

1142
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,863
Insisted on expensive binding for the first edition

1143
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
He charged $60 for

1144
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,727
He said for an initial printing of 500 copies

1145
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
And he couldn't even sell that

1146
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,639
In pale horse rider one of Bill's friend says he still has several untouched boxes

1147
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,687
I'll be limited and signed first edition

1148
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Piled up in Cooper's old storage unit

1149
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
It sounds like every comedians

1150
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:06,975
Michelle Mooresville station Chief in Oklahoma

1151
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,279
In recognition of her tireless work

1152
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
Cooper promoted from lieutenant

1153
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,959
Hard to imagine how he got George Washington to sign off on that promotion

1154
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
This is a Battlefield

1155
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:28,735
Is 01 where is chorizo for

1156
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:35,391
First lieutenant

1157
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
And also I should tell you Jordan that I just decided to make you a colonel for all the hard work you've done on this podcast

1158
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
Total.

1159
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,407
I don't know it's Four Star General

1160
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,711
Is the definite balance of empower

1161
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:05,087
Yes I agree

1162
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:13,023
I believe our last episode the covered

1163
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,839
Somebody's dispatch

1164
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,887
About updates on the bomb

1165
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
Seem to just be

1166
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
I met a nice person

1167
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:27,359

1169
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
So weird

1170
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
So you can imagine my surprise

1171
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
Talking utter disbelief

1172
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,831
Google Dreadful things coming from my gut

1173
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
The federal building bombing

1174
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
Adore creative seven days

1175
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511

1177
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327

1181
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,431
The word he was saying we're treasonous

1182
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,247
You can bring one

1183
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,807
Mind control by one week's worth of

1184
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575

1185
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343

Unbeliever

1187
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,303
I did my best to find him with a mover to a room was according to law

1188
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,607
What purpose it serves what country

1189

Do not make all those who love this company on Danger

1192
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,711
Here

1193
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
A word of it

1194
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,647
7 gravity killed in his home by some invading enemy than to be rescued from The Invader by Emarosa

1195
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
Quite a bit of brainwashing

1196
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,327
German batteries really

1197
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:59,775
He'd rather be killing you home by coming waiting in a meeting to be rescued from The Invader by a militia member

1198
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,311
Coco videos

1199
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:05,663
I don't care about your station Chiefs relationship with her dad

1200
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,991
Is this news what is going on here

1201
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,783
What is Anthony

1202
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:18,207
Dying

1203
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,583
Patriots a personal interest

1204
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,887
You got a personalized

1205
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:31,263
You know people really this woman

1206
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
Listening

1207
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,223
I resented it.

1208
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
I found it first of all to be distasteful

1209
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
Cuz I don't care

1210
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,623
Right

1211
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,183
Conceivably Bill Cooper supposed to be disguised like

1212
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,255
Can see through all the conspiracies and he knows everything

1213
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,959
Your time is valuable

1214
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
Chris Wallace

1215
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,127
Really mean stuff about Fox News

1216
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:14,527
I don't ever want to speak to that again

1217
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:19,903
Maybe it's cuz you're reading a text instead of doing work maybe

1218
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
Maybe you could have figured out what the

1219
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,191
Talking about

1220
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
Delicious

1221
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Who cares

1222
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,127
That's a good point

1223
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,527
There's an undercurrent a feeling of

1224
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Alienation

1225
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Coming

1226
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,599
Rhombus

1227
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,623
The station chief

1228
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,415
And her dad

1229
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
Being a family break

1230
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
How accurately she's /

1231
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,327

Fuel

1233
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:09,055
Alienated from their own parent where they're saying treasonous things because they believe the Communist News Network

1234
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:14,175
Need to cut off ties with all family there suppressive persons

1235
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,015
I was thinking of taking tea

1236
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Talking again when I was thinking last Saturday night

1237
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
Monarch Casino

1238
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,951
I guess I did not realize

1239
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
My dad

1240
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Is Merrill

1241
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
The enemy

1242
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,631
That's so f***** up

1243
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Station chief

1244
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Bill Cooper

1245
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,031
Timothy McVeigh

1246
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
Allegedly

1247
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
Code Avengers like

1248
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Don't leave

1249
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Between you and me

1250
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:56,671
Obvious reasons I couldn't touch his butt

1251
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
But yeah

1252
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,975
Don't

1253
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,815
IPads

1254
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:11,519
I still don't know what I believe I don't like chance

1255
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
Meeting between them

1256
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,871
Cuz you the fabulist in a liar

1257
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
I don't know

1258
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,623
Not that that is a fallacy though just because someone's a liar assuming they're always lying

1259
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
Is is dangerous game

1260
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,655
In the middle

1261
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,959
Praying like just taking a weird route

1262
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,751
Through his personal email

1263
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,615
Doesn't belong on the show at all

1264
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,807
Spring through the gold does the lens of like

1265
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:59,647
They're so evil they've brainwashed your dad

1266
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Get close

1267
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,791
I'm sure all of you have had

1268
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Terrible

1269
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Your family members believing

1270
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,911
Not Bill Cooper

1271
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
Tragedy

1272
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,103
To do with the axle

1273
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,431
Discharge from the Ryder truck

1274
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,759
And the notion

1275
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,527
It was

1276
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,087
The notion that people were vaporized

1277
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
It gets more to talk about that here

1278
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:36,255
Pocatello Shawnee Oklahoma cremation service in Oklahoma City

1279
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,327
Work for The Cremation process

1280
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
And some detail

1281
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,679
Some people were literally

1282
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,703
Vaporizer

1283
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,311
Vaporized

1284
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:53,151
But I can guarantee you it'll never found any trace of any truck

1285
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,783
It is

1286
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,183
Do you begin to be able to tell like he's reading a message from the station.

1287
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
Lieutenant

1288
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,767
Soon-to-be major

1289
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:14,143
You start to be able to tell like this isn't reading any mail

1290
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
What's going on here

1291
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
So

1292
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,031
Is the station chief

1293
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
At the crematorium

1294
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,383
Now what we're doing is the bear taking

1295
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Information

1296
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:28,223
Crematorium person

1297
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,271
And applying it to news-record

1298
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,575
Of people being vaporized

1299
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,415
And then they're saying

1300
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,231
I don't think

1301
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,535
Bijou comes down to

1302
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
Divorce

1303
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
It's possible that the actual

1304
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Slime

1305
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
The complete outward Force

1306
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
Explosion

1307
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:54,079
Simultaneously someone standing near the truck

1308
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
Force of the blast hit

1309
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,223
And drive them being essentially vaporizer

1310
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,039
What bill is doing here is creating a false

1311
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Contradiction

1312
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,391
He's implying that one thing is true and therefore another thing

1313
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,767
It feels intuitively correct that actual shouldn't

1314
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,327
Survive

1315
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,703
What bill is doing here is also mixing up what vaporized means in different contexts

1316
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:27,103
He goes on to give a long diatribe about the temperature is it with things like calcium vaporized

1317
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,175
Which he's trying to use to prove that any part of the Ryder truck

1318
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,503
Verizon

1319
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,599
This isn't what people mean when they say that a body was vaporized

1320
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Generally speaking

1321
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:44,767
There's a definition that scientist would use to describe the chemical processes and sort of vernacular

1322
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
The third definition in Merriam-Webster is to destroy bajor as if converting

1323
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:58,335
This sentence is a date that they use to demonstrated in a sentences quote attempt vaporized by a shell

1324
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,151
Obviously the Shell tank didn't become Allsburg

1325
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,455
It's just a term used to describe a

1326
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
Particular type of destruct

1327
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
Due process

1328
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Winning this contest

1329
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
It's just hyperbole

1330
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
And it's it's a Sci-Fi

1331
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,951
Because when you say vaporizer

1332
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,023
If you mean it in a destructive way the way that these guys are

1333
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
They're talking about

1334
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
There should be nothing

1335
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,655
Right it should be literally vapor

1336
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
Which is only Sci-Fi

1337
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:29,567
No it's not it's it's real real but in this context it's not like theirs

1338
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
Zero evidence of explosion

1339
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
You could get there

1340
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,831
Volcanic eruptions you can leave

1341
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:47,231
The stories that I was able to sign about the Oklahoma City

1342
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
World Trade Center

1343
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:52,095
Typically being used

1344
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
Generally had to do with

1345
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,263
You know people who died in ways that you couldn't get identifiable remains

1346
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,543
So

1347
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,335
You know if someone's body is like

1348
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:08,223
Exploded to a part where it's not recognizable

1349
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
Just Called Mariah

1350
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:17,439
It's not a technical term

1351
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,743
In some media coverage

1352
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,535
And then implying

1353
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:31,519
Is that everything was so hot that the body became vapor

1354
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
Convince

1355
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,079
News stories were saying

1356
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
Well I mean the

1357
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:41,247
Because it takes a ridiculous amount of heat

1358
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,927
It would melt the axle before a human body

1359
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,951
The game is being played

1360
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
You could look up

1361
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
How much

1362
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,887
Heated takes vaporizing axle you could look up

1363
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,679
Just look at it

1364
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
The internet

1365
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
That's true

1366
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
Books exist

1367
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,151
Divulge

1368
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:13,503
Until one of your listeners to go look for it and call it a day

1369
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:20,159
You can find so many people who dedicated their entire life

1370
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,695
Situation

1371
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
But

1372
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,535
You should really probably trust your station Chief who hates her dad now

1373
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Crematorium

1374
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
So

1375
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:42,175
I haven't really pulled out from each episode but does deserve mention is that

1376
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,223
Is Mike still selling

1377
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Is gold

1378
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,575
Germany alternate Bucky Bergquist America

1379
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
If you're interested

1380
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Real money

1381
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
Rapport

1382
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,463
Proverbial buffalo chicken

1383
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,511
I'm telling you is not far off

1384
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Then you better call response

1385
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
To put Mediterranean

1386
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,911
Talk to them about what real money really is

1387
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
So

1388
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,799
You know I'd so like

1389
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
Where is the trend of like

1390
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,247
Deschutes about that the fan got to get real money

1391
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,319
Still a little bit speaker bass sales but whatever

1392
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
Subway

1393
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,279
Philosophy of river fires the first shot

1394
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
Revert Alexei this exact same thing

1395
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,191
Pretty common and it also is nonsensical internally

1396
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,799
Remember I've always told you I've warned you I had admonished you River

1397
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
Fires the first

1398
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,847
Shop wings

1399
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
USA

1400
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,855
That's what the Socialist

1401
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
Murray

1402
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,463
That's why they blew up in the building in Oklahoma

1403
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,791
Because I'm telling you right now it was the government

1404
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,583
Intelligence community

1405
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Zach bitter

1406
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
Richmond Alabama

1407
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,775
So bilbili the river spiders the first shot

1408
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
Socialist believe

1409
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,872
The New World Order

1410
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
Because they get to blame it on their enemies

1411
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
Either whatever

1412
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,856
New World Order

1413
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Shot

1414
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
So what is he telling his audience

1415
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,816
Is he telling them that they should just wait for another shot

1416
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,240
Why would you be insisting to the audience

1417
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
That whoever fires the first shot loses it the first shot

1418
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Fired

1419
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
They lose

1420
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
According to your principles

1421
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,712
It's not some abstract future thing now

1422
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Facebook

1423
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:57,856
The first shot fired

1424
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
Shot

1425
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
Justified

1426
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,520
That's the implication of what bills saying but he would never say that because then the game's over

1427
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Is one of the things that the

1428
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,872
Proof that these people are full of

1429
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:24,736
If you think you've proven that the New World Order blew up a federal building and kill Tony

1430
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:29,088
The people and that isn't enough for you to say that it's time to take up arms against them

1431
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,368
Where is that point

1432
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,696
There is no point because you know that when you cross that line

1433
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
You're not making any more money

1434
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,096
So you stay right on the edge

1435
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,424
I would say

1436
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,216
Same-day shipping is more than

1437
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:56,480
Duplicate going to happen especially when the New World Order conspiracy that

1438
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:04,672
Rashad tour

1439
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,304
Start

1440
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
Call Scott

1441
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:18,752
Coldwater and fires the first shot

1442
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,568
Which is why they come back during the other cold

1443
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
To win the next top

1444
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,152
Thanks get a headache

1445
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,456
Bad sick of it

1446
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:33,344
So I would describe as a rare apology

1447
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,976
Because apparently

1448
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,048
They were in the military in the week one of them was

1449
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Too I guess

1450
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
Serve honorably

1451
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
Week one of my knowledge

1452
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,896
Upholstery repair Irving does

1453
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Score

1454
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,248
Solo

1455
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
Concept

1456
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,832
Jorgensen

1457
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,624
Proven guilty I apologize

1458
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
We're making a

1459
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
Last night I could not

1460
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Terminator

1461
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
Bill designs is worth giving an apology about

1462
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:20,192
Military

1463
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
That's amazing

1464
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,288
None of the other Stephanie's career requires retract

1465
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,312
This.

1466
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,896
The first chapter of his book was based off fraudulent document

1467
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,880
Behold a Pale Horse contained a full reprinting of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1468
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,888
Oh no it's not a problem

1469
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
Beard suggest that two men been arrested for blowing up a federal building art patriotic

1470
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,568
They were in the service

1471
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,384
And that's something that he's got to make right

1472
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
That's wild do not

1473
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Do not

1474
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,224
Absolutely

1475
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,296
Denigrate our military men even though

1476
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,088
Quickly in my worldview

1477
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,672
They are controlled by the New World Order and they will be used to destroy us

1478
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
Something like that

1479
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
F*** with the Miller

1480
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,352
So if we get back to this other than the other

1481
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,936
Socialists are Nazis Nazis are socialist you are that kind of thing

1482
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
We must not allow

1483
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,032
To happen here what happened in Nazi Germany

1484
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
It will not be up

1485
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,968
Depends doctor in another

1486
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,248
Nuremberg trials

1487
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,088
It will be the real

1488
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
The real

1489
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,768
Nazis are socialist

1490
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,304
Don't ever forget that

1491
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
And Republican

1492
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Control governments

1493
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
And Liberty

1494
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
Constipation Coronavirus

1495
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
Gold and silver coin

1496
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
United States code

1497
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,880
Money is gold and silver coins

1498
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Admittedly

1499
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,048
Measurement called a dollar

1500
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,400
Call Chris Merritt reagan-era 1-800

1501
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
289

1502
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
26

1503
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,264
4pics Spokane get some real money

1504
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,056
You better do it soon

1505
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
I'm taking garlic Raymond Grenier

1506
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:45,600
Yeah that's

1507
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:51,488
The real Nazi Nazi Nazi

1508
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
Alex

1509
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,680
Yeah just a different personality differ

1510
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:02,496
Broadcasting style doing the same thing as aloe

1511
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Wild

1512
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,592
I hate I don't understand why lie under

1513
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
Completely

1514
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
They always say nothing their social

1515
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,736
Socialism being an economics

1516
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,040
Right they never say Nazis are fat

1517
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,624
Fashion speaking the government system that they don't lie

1518
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
So

1519
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
It seems to me

1520
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,304
Angry about it

1521
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,008
Kind of

1522
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,360
Property rights

1523
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
AR

1524
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
Above-average

1525
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:48,064
Way to get to Fascism real fast at loggerheads

1526
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,160
Moratorium

1527
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
Socialist

1528
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,952
System totally

1529
01:26:55,232 --> 01:27:00,864
There's something else that bill is a little bit upset about it got a little bee in his Bonnet and that is that

1530
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,144
When on 60 Minutes

1531
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,960
And I had an interview and bill has decided

1532
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,240
He has condemned

1533
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Honda

1534
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
60 minutes

1535
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
Steve kroft

1536
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:22,112
It seems almost certain homegrown terrorism

1537
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,648
How do we respond to that

1538
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,280
Well we have to arrest the people who do

1539
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,608
We have to put him on trial

1540
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,728
We have to convince them and punish them I certainly bleed but they could be extra Google

1541
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
Tiger

1542
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Quilling

1543
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
We all do

1544
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,920
Fire Department

1545
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:52,064
Do you know you've already convicted him and your ex

1546
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Peculiar

1547
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,112
It's not what he said

1548
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Is not a mirror

1549
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
You literally said nothing

1550
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,744
102 not for you to decide

1551
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
Getting curious

1552
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,584
Precision Auto

1553
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,984
I don't know I mean baby maybe president

1554
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,080
If a president

1555
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,384
After a federal building is blown up

1556
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:25,600
I think the death penalty is appropriate

1557
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
Called for his death

1558
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,160
Good person

1559
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,696
No no I don't know

1560
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,744
I don't know I guess if you want to really

1561
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,072
Stick be a stickler about it whatever bill has that one

1562
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
The dumb that you can have it

1563
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
Cooper also gets mad

1564
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,984
Bill Clinton

1565
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
Some things about Waco

1566
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
60 minutes

1567
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:54,272
And goes on a diatribe about Waco that I'm not going to address

1568
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
Any easy is

1569
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,416
Very mad

1570
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
I cannot believe that any serious

1571
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
Patriotic American

1572
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,560
This is

1573
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,608
Can't believe

1574
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:14,752
That the conduct of those people of Waco Justified the kind of outrageous behavior

1575
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,544
Seen here in Oklahoma City

1576
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,872
Are the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that we're hearing all across the

1577
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
Country today

1578
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
What's wrong

1579
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
What is he talking

1580
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,368
No patriotic American you cold turkey

1581
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,648
Everstart

1582
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:37,024
Little people at Waco Justified anything that happened in Oklahoma City

1583
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,840
Doesn't sound true has a long pause

1584
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:43,936
And the only way you can really get around as a comment like that is just how do you

1585
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,472
Define patriotic America

1586
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
If you're going to

1587
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
Disabled

1588
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:57,248
Sayings that Waco justifies the Oklahoma City bombing preclude you from being a patriotic

1589
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
Axiomatic

1590
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,392
Disqualify

1591
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
Diamond Lake

1592
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
Definitely thought that

1593
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,768
Yeah and I

1594
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:14,144
I would be shocked if there wasn't at least one episode of Bill Cooper Zone show where he said

1595
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
This justifies some sort of response

1596
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:23,104
That is commensurate with what the government did

1597
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,664
Saudi reticence to make a prediction

1598
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,224
To surprise

1599
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,296
There's also like

1600
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Is that is it

1601
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,088
It's ludicrous

1602
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Do you say that

1603
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,136
That wasn't a position

1604
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Some people help

1605
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,976
Absolutely maybe it wasn't all the wishes

1606
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:43,328
Probably wasn't I'm sure that there were a lot of people were horrified by the event

1607
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,120
That transpired

1608
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:51,520
We're condemning I'm positive of that

1609
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:01,504
Definition games

1610
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,064
Preserving some sense of

1611
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
Self

1612
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:10,976
He's going to get to the bottom of both Oklahoma City and Waco

1613
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,304
Is it going to buy a TV station

1614
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
I going to ask

1615
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
Every American

1616
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
Gather evidence

1617
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
And crew

1618
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,008
I'm beginning investigation to find

1619
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
The perpetrators

1620
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:26,848
And help

1621
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
Bring to Justice

1622
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,736
The murderers of Oklahoma City

1623
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,320
And the murderers of Waco Tex

1624
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
Beaver pelt

1625
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,536
We are going to find out who did it

1626
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,376
We are going to wake up unlimited coin to insured

1627
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,656
Somebody comes out and talk

1628
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,264
And I helped you out

1629
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
Going to come back on you Bill Clinton

1630
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,408
Janet Reno

1631
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,712
Bimp ATL

1632
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
And whoever

1633
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,272
And however

1634
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
Did the bombing

1635
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
In Oklahoma City

1636
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,768
You don't need to do that verification party hard

1637
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
He's done

1638
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:20,864
Investigation has been completed already

1639
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:27,520
We're going to raise up a whole bunch of money in order to lure some very competent

1640
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:33,152
Tell a great story

1641
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,944
What's that I can hear Money

1642
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
Go to work

1643
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,528
It's a wonderful friend of money

1644
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
You guys like

1645
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
Yeah

1646
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
Great Clips

1647
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:48,512
Bill theory about how we're going

1648
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Going to get rid of this Menace

1649
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,328
It's known as Bill Clinton

1650
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,120
Spoiler alert

1651
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Didn't work

1652
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
I cannot believe this

1653
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
Hello

1654
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,240
Are we have

1655
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,264
Someone

1656
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
Stickable Cherokee

1657
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
It does not speak well

1658
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
Primerica

1659
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,368
We're at the cheese out of the next election in the way to do it is to

1660
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Adjoin

1661
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
Constitution party

1662
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,840
Veritas

1663
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
By the way should all be

1664
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,400
Driving to

1665
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,216
Because it's the only place that you're ever going to read the Pooh

1666
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,800
So at this point

1667
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,968
Douching party also known as the US taxpayers party never a viable party and it nope

1668
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:45,088
Ever fielded a candidate that has received more than 2% of the vote for president

1669
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Remember

1670
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
I've also never won an electoral vote

1671
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,072
In 1996 Howard Phillips campaign for president

1672
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:01,216
Over the 1992 election

1673
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:05,824
I'm not sure that they've even ever successfully fielded a candidate for Congress

1674
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,664
In 2018 I can find one

1675
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,456
And it was in North Carolina

1676
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,784
The Greene County Commissioner election for District 3

1677
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Anyway

1678
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
Get that guy out

1679
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,584
If you're a member of that party you got to go

1680
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,912
Commissioner who knows

1681
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:41,152
They're supposed to be on a team that never wins because they never have to deal with what comes after winning

1682
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,224
And you always have a ready excuse for why you lost

1683
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,016
This is the one thing

1684
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,344
That Alex forgot to include in his impression of Bill Cooper

1685
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
And

1686
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,440
Bad news you never want to win

1687
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:59,840
You never want to win so that's why the Constitution party

1688
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:06,496
Search of principled

1689
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,824
More juice go straight libertarian party

1690
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,224
Although it's never really going to work out for you

1691
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,760
So I mean like

1692
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:23,648
Disappointing as a stretch of time because I really don't think that there was

1693
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,440
Watch coverage of the bomber

1694
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,024
He's decided it's fake

1695
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,096
There's a lot of yelling about Waco

1696
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,496
Can we continue it already started

1697
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,544
Previously they

1698
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
I guess proven

1699
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,872
That it was a false flag or something

1700
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,456
I'm convinced yes

1701
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,016
But I mean hey

1702
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,552
We now have

1703
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,600
It within our field of awareness

1704
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
The bills

1705
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
May have

1706
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
But

1707
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
That's just so wild

1708
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,560
The bill is named dropping Larry Nichols

1709
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,608
And that means we might do it again

1710
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:08,704
I don't think he's ever been on his show cuz I call it

1711
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,728
Speaking his name

1712
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,776
Scrolling through

1713
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,128
The first Apostle

1714
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:23,808
Especially as Whitewater is continuing to go along

1715
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,576
Retire

1716
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,696
Thompson

1717
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:34,560
Becoming more of a

1718
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:43,008
Cooper first phone call anymore

1719
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,848
That is true

1720
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:50,432
Apologize for the delay

1721
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,248
Episode

1722
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,112
2

1723
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:06,560
I meant there were other circumstances going on that may have just

1724
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:10,656
Did you and not your personal decision making sense Colonel cast

1725
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
It just

1726
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,920
In these couple days that much

1727
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
Growth

1728
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,528
And so we'll see what the section chief

1729
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:35,232
We are also on

1730
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:41,632
Facebook review

1731
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,192
Mario bail fund or the lake

1732
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,752
To help with people doing

1733
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:56,224
The Chicago station chief of the citizens agency

1734
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,272
Journalistic integrity

1735
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,088
Second continental army of the Republic

1736
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,392
Holding

1737
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,024
Alex
