1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey everybody

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Alex Jones

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:20,480
Hey

00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
Vacations

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
Could possibly

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,464
I mean I know I know 2000

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,496
What's better situation in Ohio in 2000

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
4

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
I don't think it would have turned

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
Right now actually yeah that would have

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
You bring that up because one of the people who

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,136
Involved on the grounds are in Florida

16
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Infowars correspondent

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
Officially finished

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Gore won

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,240
The I know Rodger Stone

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Who's involved because

21
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,360
I know a lot about Alex Jones Infowars

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,456
Unconventional

23
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
The people

24
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Is a big announcement

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
People yet

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
In my lab

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Working on the research for The Obama Deception

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
10 documentary

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
That we will be

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,448
The week of Thanksgiving

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
And everyone who supports

32
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Over the week of Thanksgiving

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Children love it love turkey

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
It's been a lot of

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
Research

36
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:11,584
That a lot of people have done things of The Obama Deception already so I thought my workload

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,448
New there is way more than a lot of these sites

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,776
I know that a lot of them actually got them

39
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Things wrong

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
So it's

41
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
It's been a ton of like

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
I know that I told you during the endgame coverage

43
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
That I found

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
130

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
Specific factual problems with what Alex Jones said

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Indian Game documentary

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
I lost

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
Lifetime you gave me an update

49
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Roughly 200

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
I want I lost count about an hour and 10 minutes

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,264
I just don't even care what the actual number is

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
It's absurd almost everything

53
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Isn't true fun there's a lot of fun information that I found out that

54
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
I appreciate it

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
So the reason is involved

56
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
In this being a

57
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Unconventional episode

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,024
Is generally on Mondays would like to do a dive into 2009

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
She was going on with

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
The beginning of the tea party and I did

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,496
But it turns out a lot of the things that are going on in 2009 or things may come up

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
In The Obama Deception

63
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,432
Not to say that like to know about the miac report when he made the Obama.

64
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
It's a lot of stuff we've been talking about

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Not necessarily in there

66
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
But it'd be very hard for me to myself

67
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
From spoiling

68
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
A lot of Obama 27

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
Can covers

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Put that on

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
The 2009

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Side to side

73
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
Let's do Wacky Wednesday episode on Monday

74
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
So I said to myself

75
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
It's dirty.

76
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,664
But I realize like 8 for long time

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
Jim Bakker I was watching The Tire hours and talking about

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
The migrant Caravan that like nope

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Terrified of it it's not I don't

80
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
That was one of the things that really really struck me wrong

81
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
About

82
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
I mean the whole idea of Jesus had to do with like helping the down

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,087
Very off brand

84
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
Christianity

85
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,023
Sure there were never any situation

86
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
People were judged

87
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
Yeah

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
This isn't going to be fun

89
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
So I'm like

90
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
Friday last Friday's episode

91
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Do a modern episode

92
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
I was very capricious

93
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I don't know

94
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,607
The racism today it was really rough because he's talking about the

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
The recount

96
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Georgia

97
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Florida

98
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
He thinks they're scam

99
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
He does

100
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
He's also like no we got Rogers

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
George Bush stole the election in 2000

102
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,647
Do you have Rodger Stone one of the guys who was apart of venue like it was a good thing that he did

103
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
What are you doing it's soaking

104
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
I don't want to do that

105
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
I do it's just my head is

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
All of it

107
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
Singto is it a lot of it a lot of his stuff is bad

108
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,239
Paul Joseph Watson put out that video that was altered

109
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
Jim Acosta and he's all

110
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,927
Big Sean

111
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
At 1

112
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
It's it's a mess

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
A real man

114
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Brazen especially for Alex someone brings up Orwell all the time

115
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
Write whatever they want to believe

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,767
The world objective reality has died

117
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Sure

118
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
The end of all of these options

119
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
All these roads

120
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
More than anything

121
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
Is understand Alex Jones more fully

122
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Highway

123
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:18,527
Of course that's really what I want out of this show because I believe that understanding him within the context

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
He's existed in

125
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Years

126
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
Helps us understand the context that he exists in

127
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
I believe

128
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Bully

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
The child is the father of man

130
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
To some extent

131
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
You know

132
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
Who you are what you experience

133
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
What you advocate

134
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
K4 is a part of what you

135
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Generally

136
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
I'm so I want

137
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Do 2009

138
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
I wanted it badly

139
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
B b

140
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Because of the intersection

141
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
No good

142
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
So I decided

143
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
See what I could find

144
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Even further in the past

145
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Oh no

146
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
So what

147
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,391
It's very difficult to find actual footage of Alex Jones from

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Public Access

149
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
But

150
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
I was able to find

151
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
A 2-hour YouTube video

152
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Compilation

153
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
And another

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
From the 70s

155
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
No

156
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
His Public Access

157
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Panera

158
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,455
What about Waco

159
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,551
It's a it's a pretty interesting glimpse

160
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
A lot of it is what you'd expect

161
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
A lot of it is.

162
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Expect

163
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
It's

164
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
It's it

165
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
It's a weird Glimpse man

166
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Just off the top

167
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
He doesn't give

168
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
S*** like or at least in this car.

169
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Maybe they selectively cut out all the parts

170
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Where we would be talking about these

171
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Care

172
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
At all about anything

173
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
All he cares about is the governor

174
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
He is f******

175
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,303
Is he a witch

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
All about the

177
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Government

178
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
All about being anti-police

179
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
There's a kernel of it that I'm like

180
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,871
Here you go buddy there's a kernel of it

181
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
It's like rock on

182
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
And I think in this first

183
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Quit we get a glimpse of

184
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Izzy Izzy

185
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Is this all the way back when he's still spelt

186
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
He's in between

187
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,559
Alright

188
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
He's on the good side

189
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Oh it's happening

190
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,639
No still hasn't turned all the way read all the time you know I don't

191
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
But I don't I don't know his wife or anything like that

192
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Alcoholic

193
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
I don't know but that might be really thinking better handle it

194
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
Or at least while he's doing the show

195
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,511
Possibility

196
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Fight in this first clip

197
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839

198
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
A piece of wood I

00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
What I was thinking about you go man alright alright

200
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Bit dirty sorted

201
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
That are I think

202
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
I think there's

203
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,991
Replace entire ask Laura if she is at the DMV protesting

204
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Mistakes when they were solo he's he's at the Austin BMV where he has made it clear

205
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Picture of

206
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
The DMV

207
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
Is put out new guidelines where you have to give us some Prince

208
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
In order to get a

209
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Alex

210
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,687
Does protesting this interview outside earlier

211
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
I brought eight forms of ID

212
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
I have every possible can

213
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Conceivable idea that anyone would ever want for

214
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
If they make me

215
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
Put my finger in the scanner in order to get my ID

216
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
I will lay down on the ground and make them arrest

217
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,655
Alligators coming it like I like it

218
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
Camera outside

219
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,591
Local news channel looking out at

220
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Going outside

221
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Dlnet

222
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Get arrested at

224
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
The BMV

225
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
I'm not doing a great job

226
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,183
What's the penalty for driving without a license you know I don't even want to go there that's right

227
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
You know why I'm asking you

228
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,143
I would be glad to see your Mark

229
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Guard your

230
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
You're sitting here sergeant in telling me that you're all friendly and you're all nice

231
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Problem with it

232
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Thumb scan like Criminal

233
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,567
We don't even need to start there if I know that you're not going to submit to a thumbprint why waste your time

234
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
Criminal Criminal

235
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
The one who used the words

236
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't know what I want you to give me my driver's license

237
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
And I want my driver's

238
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
That's fine

239
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,391
I like his voice

240
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Dude

241
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
U.s. cellular near me

242
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
I'm not I'm just

243
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Look man

244
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
I'm trying to get arrested on principal you're not helping me out here

245
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
You're saying you'd like to help me over and over again

246
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
Play like that in Paris

247
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,039
This was a fruitless Quest on a tentative level is

248
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Because I don't

249
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Necessarily think it is

250
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
Should be required to give a fingerprint in order to get a driver's

251
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,279
I think that this is probably a place where

252
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
I think it's a protesting that he's probably

253
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
A little bit

254
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Alex's

255
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Further argument that

256
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
This is just a step towards them

257
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
Blood in urine

258
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Alright

259
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,183
This kind of Alex Right Alright guy

260
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Beautifully Lodi

261
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,655
There's no downside there's a societal value to have

262
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Exist

263
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Isn't aggressive

264
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
No I'm not

265
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Whether or not

266
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
That is the sort of issue

267
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Glad you worked

268
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
You know what I never would have thought about it

269
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,487
I've been a cattle member just gotten up and then giving them a thumbprint

270
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Take me away to the driver's ed school

271
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Because

272
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
A little

273
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
Later in this exchange that he has

274
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Alex

275
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Reveal something about himself

276
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,407
In the mid-90s

277
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,295
Constitutional right to travel

278
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
BoBoiBoy

279
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,079
I'm not going to violate UCS

280
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
For your exception

281
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,391
Is exactly the point of Alex is a sovereign citizen

282
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
For sure

283
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
The ideas he cannot be like

284
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Situational right

285
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
To travel that is

286
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Sovereign citizen

287
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
Because they believe that you should be able to drive cars

288
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
And that the only reason anyone needs a license

289
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Is for like commercial

290
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
And you can have that license in all caps

291
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
Otherwise they own your car

292
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Alex

293
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
His phrasing that

294
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Reveals to me

295
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,391
Clearly he has at least Sovereign citizen

296
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Believe

297
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Dating back

298
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
As far as the Moon

299
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
So that's interesting

300
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
I find that very interesting

301
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
I find the right to travel

302
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Endlessly

303
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Well

304
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
To get shot.

305
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
People who have guns

306
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
I wish I was just like a weird mainstream argument

307
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
Like why not have Elizabeth Warren just for one moment go on like I should have the right to travel across state line

308
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
What about state line

309
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,791
Haploid

310
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:12,191
Richard silly to because Alex starts to related

311
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
Can you have your f****** passport that works as an ID for any of those

312
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Scrabble

313
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
It's it's

314
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
What up no fly zone

315
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Does it do Sovereign citizens respect no-fly zone

316
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
I don't know about

317
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Constitutional

318
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,719
To fly over in our magary area 51

319
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,119
I have a blind spot

320
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
BMV

321
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
Irate

322
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
Fun at least for our purposes

323
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
So harmless

324
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,783
Alex just getting arrested on principal going down to the DMV thing I won't

325
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Duplicate license that's even better

326
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
Order for a publicity stunt

327
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,239
To be done

328
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,359
There's a Craftsman stupid would you take it out of realizes that

329
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
But

330
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
At the same time

331
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
You know

332
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
Its meaning is a

333
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Seems harmless

334
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
Your honor in the

335
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
In the case of

336
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
The State versus

337
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Humbly say

338
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Dude come on

339
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399

00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,031
It, if you've already if you've already given the state finger scan

341
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Or whatever

342
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
What you should do

343
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
Is make a big stink out of it

344
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
But still do it again because they already have your f****** taking forever so

345
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,671
I already have my fingerprint

346
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,535
You can save yourself please give him my duplicate license you should try and get your finger

347
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,311
To be forgotten

348
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Famous Mexican

349
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Alex Jones

350
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175

Wondrous Beauty

352
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Drill baby drill

353
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
That's not the angle

354
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
He believes

355
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
President Clinton

356
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,863
Has signed an executive order

357
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Control

The beautiful Grand Canyon

361
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
One of America's most beautiful Treasures

362
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,439
And it's very distressing to me and other Patriots people that

363
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
Truly do care about the environment America

364
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559

Wait what

374
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,719
A little bit of a

375
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,791
In front of the Grand Canyon

376
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
News remote to another shot where he's about to her a bunch of them.

Ladies and gentlemen

986

383
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
Which designated this is the world heritage site under UNESCO Corporation

384
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,512
United Nations Media

385
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Have you heard about it

386
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Heard about it

387
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
I pulled up

388
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Executive order

389
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Wants to

390
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
986

391
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
From 1996 signed by Bill Clinton

392
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Yep

393
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
It's called International Union for conservation of Nature and natural resources

394
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
By virtue of the authority vested in me as president

395
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
Houston in the laws of the United States

396
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Including sex

397
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Blah blah blah blah blah blah

398
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
I hereby extend

399
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
The international Union

400
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,768
For conservation of Nature and natural resources

401
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,328
The privileges and immunities that provide or protect

402
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Came to immunity from

403
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,728
Disinfect the following sections of the international organization immunities actual not apply

404
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
To the international Union for conservation

405
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
All it does is make immune

406
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
From Lost

407
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
This

408
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
International Union

409
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
No edit

410
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Transferring

411
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Property of the United States

412
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
The national parks over to the international

413
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,840
Community about that found a bunch of like Patriot

414
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,144
Message boards that work

415
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
Hey Alex says that this executive order gives the

416
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Nothing to do with that

417
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,384
Even the people on his side were like

418
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
There's a huge problem with his argument that he's making

419
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
Funny

420
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,880
I don't I don't know do you need it

421
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
What's the drive-in

422
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Now it's comical because

423
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
In the early days of the Trump Administration

424
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:04,448
He started making moves in order to sell parts

425
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,592
Start about that you plan on raping and pillaging

426
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
The punchline

427
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
Alex doing some more voice over after

428
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Gets done harassing

429
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
These people about

430
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
Executive order that he is completely lying to

431
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,232
No sooner had I turned away

432
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Call Mia

433
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:33,376
I guess they weren't 1286

434
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,216
I guess I don't believe it must I hear it from his mouth

435
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,408
Nothing to do with who's saying it has to do with like what the truth is

436
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,064
Yeah

437
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
None of them want to read the executive order because I don't believe in anything unless

438
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
All I wanted to do

439
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,824
Stand with my back to whatever it is that's by what is this

440
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,432
Call marvelling at natural beauty

441
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
I wanted to find people who scraped together enough money

442
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,952
People who live across country

443
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,328
To Arizona to see the natural beauty of the Grand Canyon have been dreaming about it for years

444
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,168
Finally got the vacation time from work down

445
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
Only yell at them about an executive order I don't understand

446
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Literally like the plot of the

447
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
You know these roads

448
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,304
Are pretty hot right now

449
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Are you coming out

450
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
EuroTrip

451
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
Maybe they work

452
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
EuroTrip movies

453
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Probably years ago

454
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Here is my point

455
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
We make a road trip movie

456
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Early Alex Jones

457
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Going to

458
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,352
Nuby natural wonders of the United States

459
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
February 1st

460
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Steve Coogan and

461
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Hot

462
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
They made three equal today

463
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
So far Alex Jones

464
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Going to the DMV

465
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
People about bulshit

466
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
I feel bad for the people that were laughing so

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
The worst thing ever

468
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Jackass probably in can

469
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
I mean

470
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Lying about

471
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
To suit his purposes but I'm still like

472
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
No racism

473
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Rudeness

474
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Rudeness is forgivable

475
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Slate Roofing

476
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
I'm in the next

477
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Alex announcing something

478
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
So weird

479
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
Given what we know about Alex

480
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
I'm the person about 4

481
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
And I jumped the shark

482
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Right here in Austin Texas

483
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Southwest Austin

484
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Where I live

485
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,336
How do you want the corruption ferreted out

486
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
You want real information.

487
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Downtown

488
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
I need you and I have a major problem

489
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
Centered in the ballot boxes

490
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
And I'll be there making

491
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Sure

492
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,488
Computer Fraud going on to where I sure

493
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
We don't watch

494
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Election fraud

495
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
48

496
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
For the great legislature

497
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Yes that's right

498
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Computers

499
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Unaccounted votes

500
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Get inside that system

501
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
Inside that mechanism and I'm going to win

502
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Here's my solution

503
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
To making sure voter fraud doesn't

504
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Plant

505
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
People

506
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
In the counting situation

507
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Secretly

508
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
Like like all good up-and-up

509
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
Pray right

510
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
No running

511
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,368
Representative

512
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
This is already worried about voter fraud in the primary screaming about like

513
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,144
Corruption

514
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,216
Luma 2000 election

515
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
You dropped out before the primary desire to

516
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
To quote focus on getting his

517
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Who's out on the airwaves

518
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Which he was already

519
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,552
Democrat kitchen ended up winning the election with 59% of the vote

520
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:45,440
My guess is that this is basically just a bit of a publicity stunt

521
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
And that no one was

522
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Rallying around to fund his campaign is like

523
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
I give up

524
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,936
Like the idea of someone who's on public access

525
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Using

526
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
Running for office as a way to get publicity

527
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
I think it's alright

528
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
Slightly and abusive

529
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,528
System

530
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,928
The guy who ran the bar I used to work at

531
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,280
Almost every time there was

532
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
Basically just to get promotion

533
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
Accidentally

534
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,568
Do you make sure of that by dropping out

535
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,920
This is just a hustler

536
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
At this point

537
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
From what we see

538
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
So far from the 90s

539
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
A mildly principled Hustler

540
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
Make the DMV

541
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
Because he's getting a duplicate

542
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Do you like we said

543
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Go there he's forcing it

544
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
And also get himself a ton

545
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Free publicity

546
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
So

547
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
I mean I'm fixing this little

548
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
When is next Alex getting

549
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
He said something

550
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
The shocking

551
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Modern

552
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Distance from

553
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Yeah we're winning over

554
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
University

555
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Their engineering

556
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Apartments

557
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
New World Order

558
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
And we're going to wear

559
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
How we know their Heroes left

560
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,696
He took me like three lessons over that I thought you said he had memories of in the slave

561
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
No

562
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
It it was I need to make that clear

563
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,080
I don't believe in reincarnation

564
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
You know it's true

565
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Is that built

566
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:37,984
Arousing

567
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Like his chops

568
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
Have always been

569
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
Gained any popularity is because he has the ability to

570
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Turn that on out of nowhere

571
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
If he wasn't a flaming bigot and he wasn't

572
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Completely obsessed

573
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
With these stupid

574
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
Communist propaganda things

575
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
I think you have the potential to be an amazing improv comedians

576
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Like he couldn't

577
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Indeed

578
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
He's one of the photo. I don't know if you had that guy

579
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
If you had someone who showed in the way in terms of

580
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:31,744
Collaborative comedy

581
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,328
I think he has the raw material that you could mold into somebody who is

582
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
F****** outrageous

583
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
He's making

584
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,496
Out of nothing

585
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,896
Out of nothing sexual memory

586
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
To know that that's forever

587
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
Because he's not making that up in the present that's been going on since he was

588
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,256
True

589
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Schizophrenia

590
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Frappe

591
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Just

592
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Really Vivid dream

593
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Possibly

594
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
We hear another

595
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
It's very

596
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
He has said

597
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Cincinnati

598
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Well because that's one of those old-time maybe communist

599
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
It's like how old is

600
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
I thought I actually kind of thought he just made it up to the 67

601
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
At least

602
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Suspected super racer

603
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't think it is

604
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
I think it's more just about the

605
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Communism

606
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
I think I don't know

607
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
I don't I'm not I'm not willing to give this one the races especially after we overreacted about coonass

608
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Totally fine I'm one of them

609
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,144
If I'm unfamiliar with the term that has coon and ass in it but

610
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
Very

611
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
Is the better part of Autobots

612
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
Anyway

613
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,504
I don't know I wanted to say discretion and I accidentally launched

614
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
Anyway Isn't that cool

615
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Alex

616
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
Which he's been afraid of forever

617
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
There's consistency there

618
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
To like what

619
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Boast

620
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Of his show is about

621
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Back then

622
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,472
It's certainly not Bill Clinton giving all of our nuclear weapons designed

623
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
No no no it's people like

624
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Sore

625
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Randy Weaver Ruby Ridge Idaho

626
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Oh boy

627
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Yeah we are the terrorists

628
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,088
We're the danger submit to Total Domination

629
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Total control

630
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Total

631
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Slavery

632
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,536
Waco is a sterling example this the lies and Corruption

633
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,168
During their activities for the children

634
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
That's why

635
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
The 17th

636
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
Little children to death

637
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Again

638
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
From the terrorist

639
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
Their parents

640
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,736
This show is so much about Waco

641
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
Like I would say

642
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Outfits to hour

643
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
Compilation that I watch

644
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,208
H plus

645
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
I don't want to talk to you much about Waco cousin

646
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Super complicated case

647
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,144
So much of it relies on people deciding to believe whatever they want to believe

648
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Like some evidence shows the David koresh

649
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,520
Is dangerous cult leader Brothers

650
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,432
Your stuff like that

651
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
True

652
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
That was

653
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Southern tide

654
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Another reason I don't want to re-litigate

655
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Too much is that I do kind of agree that the

656
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
The standoff

657
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Wasn't handled in the best way possible

658
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
I suspect there are better ways

659
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
They could result in that kind of

660
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
But I'm not sure what that path would

661
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
And I think it's

662
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Beyond me

663
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
To assume that I know what the right is

664
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
Just to remind our listeners

665
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Remember the

666
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Clearly

667
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
What happened everything went wrong

668
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
Janet Reno threw a Molotov

669
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
The window of

670
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
That's Alex's version

671
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,352
Name the show that he does but then

672
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Realize that Bree noses

673
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Radio station

674
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,336
Search has made claims of rooted in the idea that won the government started the fires

675
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
The burn down the comp

676
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
People trying to

677
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Leave out the back

678
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,736
Both of these things

679
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,600
Senator John Danforth was charged at the special counsel investigate

680
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,904
Waco standoff in 1999

681
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
This investigation found that they were

682
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Very clear indication

683
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
Started the fire themselves

684
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
This is based on the fact that he

685
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
The potentially pyrotechnics

686
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
That were shot by the government they were trying to force people out

687
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Of the

688
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
At the building

689
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,616
Those four hours before the fire started and they weren't fired in the places where the fires

690
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Ended up starting

691
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
In addition to that lab analysis found that there were

692
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Accelerants

693
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
Clothing

694
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Investigators found

695
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Punctured fuel

696
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:51,232
Beyond that survivors were on record saying that they overheard other Branch Davidians talking about

697
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,584
It's acceptable I guess to have suspicions about the fires

698
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
Faith absolutely unreasonable to assume that the government started

699
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Based on the app

700
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,800
Real credibility

701
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
All the time

702
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
It's not true

703
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,176
Play the government was shooting people trying to

704
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,504
Escape this is based on infrared video that were shot by overhead are

705
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,088
It's people like Alex blame the video shows flashes

706
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Gunshot

707
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,160
Is there bodies piled up by the

708
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
We are exiting the building

709
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,768
Right experts analyze the videos may sound that there's no way that they

710
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Reflected gunfire

711
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
But they're actually thermal reflections of

712
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
The fire was charging up

713
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Making spin in the air because of

714
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,336
That just sort of wind spinner cause

715
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,760
I've some reflective things ended up like spinning

716
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
It made it look like there was a

717
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Flash flash flash flash

718
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
AMC

719
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
This is what every

720
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Credible

721
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,840
Further there were no bodies found in the room where the rear exit

722
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
Rashad Rashad with high velocity

723
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Around

724
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,264
Which one would expect shot by machine gun

725
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Or snipers

726
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
People like Alex

727
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
So

728
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
He spent so much of his time

729
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
Building up his case about the government being

730
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm super oppressive

731
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Based on

732
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Lies

733
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
Most of those people were victims

734
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,888
That board

735
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Is the tragedy

736
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Situation

737
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Irresponsible

738
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,640
A lot of government fervor that he would like to be able to

739
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Exploit

740
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
For his

741
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Career

742
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
Make the furtherance of his

743
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
His career without taking into account

744
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
It doesn't match the actual info

745
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
It's a good thing that he only did this at the

746
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
The beginning of his career

747
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
And once he got that popularity

748
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Realized

749
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
The error of his

750
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,424
And then it became a competent

751
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Yeah

752
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Right

753
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Definitely

754
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
I'm sorry

755
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
I was I was

756
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
Revelling

757
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
So I don't know I I feel real

758
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Grouse about

759
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
At Alex's

760
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Waco Behavior

761
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Especially realizing B

762
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,696
Continuing worldview and how he evolves the narrative

763
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
To do with the Bedrock of

764
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
His lies about Waco

765
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
Coupled with

766
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
What do you say

767
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,656
Maybe 10-15 times just

768
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Compilation

769
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Is like

770
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Hitler burn down the reichstag

771
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
Ascend

772
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Chancellor of America

773
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,808
Or Bill Clinton the after-effects you would expect

774
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
If this was some sort of a thing

775
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Where they did this

776
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
Rice-like situation

777
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
The proof of the pudding is in the eating as they say

778
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,168
Although we don't know who may have been elevated

779
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Through Waco

780
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,288
I hate I hate you

781
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,896
Somebody real in the elevator

782
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
I hate this so much

783
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
I hate I hate that so much

784
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
Because it relies on the word May

785
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
You can do with the EXO yeah okay

786
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,536
Sure if you use that kind of warp thinking

787
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
Whatever you would do

788
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Might with you okay

789
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
So

790
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,824
A lot of a lot of

791
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,431
I don't know if I got a lot of this stuff is about

792
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Rehashes of this

793
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
But there's one

794
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
It's Alex

795
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
Microphone

796
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
Presumably the town hall meeting

797
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,279
Arguing and insulting

798
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
When it comes time for me to leave my parents my girlfriend

799
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
Call my country

800
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
And

801
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
Are you almost laughing

802
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
Talk about that or I have no idea about that

803
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Eureka

804
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,887
About this ATM

805
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,495
Criminal

806
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Look like

807
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
No it's not personal

808
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,599
It's a it's a huge

809
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
I had to come and talk to you

810
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,423
I know what's going on the country I know about rex-84

811
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
I know about

812
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
I've Been Around The Nasher

813
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
I know what's going on

814
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
In this country

815
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:32,991
Since the early 90s early to mid-90s he's been yelling at ATF agent

816
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
Rex 84

817
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
Which in present day

818
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
He's I got to run before

819
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Perfect

820
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Is flipping on the idea of the

821
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,375
Stealing of the 2000 election

822
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,935
Waffle. Everything is

823
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:57,055
That is also just such a laundry list of things that immediately make you go

824
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
Oh you don't know what's

825
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
Oh I know about rex-84 about the national parks

826
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,247
I know about all the

827
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,183
I'll let you know what to do

828
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
Cincinnati

829
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
The Grand Canyon

830
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,351
Exercise 1984

831
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
That didn't

832
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Happened

833
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
So I don't really thought it was

834
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,151
Really thought that photos after Alex's son

835
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
Edit

836
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
Drafted in 1980

837
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
But that's

838
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
Unfortunately not true

839
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,367
Finish up with Alex

840
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,535
Why you haven't Seaway carrozza gauge

841
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
Why you won't comment away from the back of the building brother automatic weapons

842
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
You saw it

843
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:11,039
No

844
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Building

845
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,695
I want to take this information I can't believe you

846
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
He always

847
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Backup

848
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,095
Multiple multiple times

849
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,703
Waco Rules of Engagement

850
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
Documentaries that was made

851
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
Since

852
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,895
Pretty thorough because there are some FairPoint

853
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,223
There is a little bit of you know

854
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
I do I don't know what the

855
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
In terms of like who fired first

856
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
Put the ogre yet

857
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,927
Could have been

858
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
It's unclear in terms of like

859
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,047
The government

860
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Who fired first

861
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
The front of the bill

862
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
But the stuff that Alex

863
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Specifically about the behind the building

864
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
Stop that overhead

865
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
Infrared footage

866
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
That is absolutely

867
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
The government shooting on the back of the building

868
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Which is part of Alex is like

869
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
They were trying to slaughter the

870
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
Killed them when they were trying to leave

871
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
If you wanted to make Subs

872
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
About like

873
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
We need to really nail down who shot first

874
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,727
I was around nobody shooting at the back

875
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Camden automatic

876
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,919
11

877
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying

878
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
That's scary I don't like

879
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Machine gun fire

880
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
Like straight up

881
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Gatling gun like murdertown

882
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
So

883
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Alex

884
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Information

885
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
This Waco rules of

886
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Documentary

887
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
And it doesn't

888
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
Imply

889
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,783
You're making a murderer now

890
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
That levels

891
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
It's so good

892
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,927
But he's so talented at this stuff is able to turn

893
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
A cursory knowledge

894
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Do something

895
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
With

896
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
Super compelling

897
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,143
It's really it's really fast

898
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,287
It's unfortunate because it is important

899
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
Yes

900
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,687
We got it why do you got to turn this into it you know like 911 like

901
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
The government

902
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,271
11 super hard

903
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,159
It was, they intercepted all this they know all of that s*** they f*****

904
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Doesn't mean they did it

905
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,303
It could just be that their s***** at their jobs doesn't need to be a giant conspiracy

906
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
You know how you're that a******

907
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
A conspiracy but it would be

908
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
Suggested

909
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
I like

910
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
Yes absolutely there are there are

911
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:27,391
You talk about things like that

912
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Conversation

913
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
Right because they detract on these

914
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
These

915
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,655
More out-there points

916
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
Art really based in reality

917
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,055
The conspiracy part of my life

918
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
He existed

919
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,407
Being paid in order to make sure we never had this conversation

920
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
Distracting people

921
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
It's not a good

922
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
Conspiracy

923
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
It would be if we had some sort of

924
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Proof that were the case

925
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
It does

926
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
To be that's just

927
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
The NRA

928
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
His instinct is to muddy the water

929
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Yeah

930
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
What comes

931
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Patriot

932
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
White

933
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:16,031
Issues for the conspiracy theory I'm just saying

934
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,871
To be the Playbook that anybody who tries to talk about gun control runs

935
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
That's true

936
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Coordinated Playbook that everybody uses

937
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
Whenever any gun control

938
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,671
Versation about maybe semi-automatic weapons

939
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Everywhere

940
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Do you know

941
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,375
Lies thrown around at all

942
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Possibilities

943
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,215
It is a it is a feature of right-wing propaganda

944
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
And that's

945
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
It's suspicious

946
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,103
Certainly

947
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
Make some sort of app

948
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Pronouncement

949
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Conspiracy

950
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Alex's

951
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,575
Exist for that role

952
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,463
But whatever the case may be

953
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,119
It is next to it which is our last clip Alex says something

954
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
That I find

955
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
To go over the

956
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Real f*****

957
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,175
We have the force

958
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
We have the capacity

959
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,807
We have the world and we will not surrender

960
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,439
We are the ones

961
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,999
Where are the ones galvanizing organization

962
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
Where am I

963
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
Where are the ones

964
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:48,703
Terrorism

965
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,007
You traitor you globalization

966
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:56,895
And you Governor bush from your CIA run Harriman brother Banker oil family

967
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:03,295
We got your numbers and weird and we are moving forward

968
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:07,647
Can you be fully aware

969
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
I'd like to thank our sponsor

970
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
Oh really add pivot

971
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:30,175
Remember that speech immediately after he gives that whole fucken

972
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:36,063
Also I would like to thank you very much

973
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,975
It's wild the fat strategy midnight

974
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
Radiate 3rd grade

975
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,959
I think the reason for that is that

976
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Cell

977
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,823
Thanks sponsors

978
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Inclination

979
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,639
Because at this point he doesn't

980
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Have Ted Anderson

981
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Right resources

982
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Communication

983
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
What's he got on board

984
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
He didn't get commercial

985
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
He barely had to

986
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Do any

987
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
So

988
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
At this point he's doing that

989
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:22,655
It's for a numbers remember looking at my 2009 stuff

990
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Could you didn't have to

991
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
Often at the end of the show

992
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
To be like

993
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,455
Search for the points when he actually has those sponsors on air

994
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
To do

995
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,903
2019

996
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
To make you fraid of food issues

997
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
That's so clever exam

998
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,655
The Grateful song

999
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,983
The reason

1000
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
Multiplication

1001
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,663
That's his way of expressing

1002
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Each one teach one

1003
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
No

1004
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,343
I'm going to reach more people

1005
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
Group it feels like

1006
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Got too crazy

1007
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,935
I think it's f***** up is using the term L list

1008
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
And the reason

1009
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
Leaderless resistance to the term was coined in 90

1010
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,871
Take me to VyStar

1011
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,663
As a means to promote Revolution

1012
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,991
The idea was that Loosely connected but not

1013
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,783
Formerly connected cells

1014
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Decentralized actors

1015
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,647
Against an enemy with numbers were far greater

1016
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
It's still stand a chance to succeed

1017
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,583
Literally

1018
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,423
Kind of early apply acts of violence or anything like that

1019
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,263
At this point. Kind of a strategy is all good and well

1020
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
If that's what Alex

1021
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
She's referring to

1022
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,127
Because Alex complains about Bill Clinton

1023
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,455
We can be sure that this rant was post 1992

1024
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,735
This is important

1025
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,783
The concept of leaderless resistance

1026
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
Bell Auto

1027
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
Until 1992

1028
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,463
What a man named Louis beam wrote a note Aureus article advocated

1029
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
Leaderless resistance

1030
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,071
Lois Bean was a door gunner in Vietnam

1031
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,631
Ku Klux

1032
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,935
Plant eventually become in the Grand Dragon

1033
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Of the Texas

1034
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,311
In 1982 he was arrested for kidnapping his daughter from his estranged

1035
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Who ended up dropping the charges

1036
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
After receiving Target

1037
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
B rassman and threats

1038
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,247
He was known for not being at all

1039
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Not into viola

1040
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
Spell bullets will prevail

1041
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
In 1981 beam want to pay a visit

1042
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
Aryan Nation

1043
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Compound in Idaho

1044
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,279
Which Butler then the

1045
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
Visiting Whitby mkk

1046
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Galveston Bay

1047
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,447
This resulted in Butler declaring beam a quote ambassador-at-large

1048
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
And serve to bring the two hate groups closer

1049
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,103
In 1984 be was instrumental in

1050
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
Creating the Aryan Nations Liberty

1051
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,943
The world's first internet hates

1052
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,319
He helped bring white supremacy into the Modern Age and gave white supremacist an online platform where they go

1053
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
To come together

1054
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,367
Deform a bulletin board

1055
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
But most important to re-issue

1056
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,487
Is beams 1992's a leaderless resistance

1057
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
Here are just

1058
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,583
A few passages out of the

1059
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
Exactly like Alex

1060
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
The passage of time will make it clear that even the more slow Among Us that the government is

1061
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Is the foremost threat

1062
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
The life and Liberty of the

1063
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
We are cognizant

1064
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,991
Before things get better they will use ever more severe police tape measures

1065
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
Against disappear

1066
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Quotes

1067
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,623
The federal objective is to imprison or destroy all who oppose them

1068
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
And I'm talking about that sounds like

1069
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Dumber members

1070
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Amongst

1071
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
His rank

1072
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:05,631
The government the government they opposed has declared a state of war against those fighting for face folks

1073
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Freedom and constitutional Liberty

1074
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Using Focalin

1075
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:15,103
That's kind of Bill O'Reilly America is quickly moving into a long dark night of Polly

1076
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Bi-State to urinate

1077
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
Where the rights now accepted by most

1078
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
As being inalienable we'll just

1079
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
The sound

1080
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
Very similar to Alex Jones

1081
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,183
Yeah easily been written by

1082
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
Mecosta exultation of the

1083
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
The references

1084
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Command and control

1085
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,839
The specific terminology used

1086
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,655
Describe the American Revolution and how that situation

1087
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Analog to the fight against

1088
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Modern.

1089
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
All there

1090
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,823
Given the timeframe in the extensive overlap of

1091
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,407
I can't come to any other conclusion than Alex Jones is

1092
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,711
Was very inspired by Louis beams Sao

1093
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Leaderless resistance

1094
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,807
He was a patriot from Texas

1095
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
Wasn't

1096
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Becomes almost

1097
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Unsaddle

1098
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
It's worse than

1099
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,287
What we have is the Grand Dragon of the Texas Clan

1100
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,383
Who served as an attache Ambassador with the Aryan Nation compound

1101
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
In Idaho

1102
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
Extreme flare up

1103
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Yeah

1104
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
Militia Act

1105
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
Supremacist white nationalist

1106
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Militia activity

1107
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,559
And you're saying he influence Alex we're all inspired by Ruby Ridge Waco Oklahoma City

1108
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
We have the leaderless resistance

1109
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,239
Which can't be read in any other way

1110
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Eating that

1111
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Contacts in that time

1112
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,895
Listening to Alex Jones Show

1113
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,943
They know that is code for this

1114
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Very seminal essay

1115
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
It was written by Louis

1116
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,135
This I don't think

1117
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
Does Deadpool

1118
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
When you look at it from the

1119
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
The prism of

1120
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
You look at

1121
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Alex Jones

1122
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Certainly

1123
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
Casey Shelton

1124
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,543
I think we get Eclipse here

1125
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:26,175
B a b up to some real bad stuff

1126
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,015
Victor bombers brother news him because he saw the

1127
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
The pet phrases in his

1128
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
Is manifest

1129
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,647
There's a little bit of

1130
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:39,999
Where there's smoke there's fire when you're using the same language somebody else

1131
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,815
It's not like leaderless resistance didn't

1132
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Before that essay

1133
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
It was not

1134
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Very pop

1135
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
It was used

1136
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Turtle in the sea

1137
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,823
It was something that is falling out of

1138
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
Vogue as I said

1139
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
Edwards ignited

1140
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
Envy

1141
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Patriots

1142
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,479
Anti-government communities

1143
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
99

1144
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Yeah

1145
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,087
The fact that Alex is speaking after night

1146
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
T92

1147
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Really

1148
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,487
It makes it so hard for me not to draw a clear line between

1149
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,047
Just getting

1150
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
Like the leaderless resistance

1151
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
Philosophy is

1152
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,359
Because they had this whole

1153
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,895
Did if you had a

1154
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Pyramidal structure

1155
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
And you had a leader up at top

1156
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,271
Buddy who infiltrated

1157
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,111
A certain level would be able to

1158
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Two bird everyone below them

1159
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
I possibly people

1160
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,255
So if you had upside down

1161
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,839
Sure if you had an upside-down pyramid

1162
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
There be much less people

1163
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
At the bottom of it

1164
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,263
Point of entry for possible mobile

1165
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
That you'd be able to burn

1166
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
And if there is no

1167
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
If you just have sales of

1168
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
Lone wolves

1169
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,967
Or five people who have their little group

1170
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
It's almost impossible

1171
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
Able to infiltrate

1172
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
So that

1173
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Super

1174
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
Super important

1175
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
To the rise of

1176
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Demolition movie

1177
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,071
The world we live in today

1178
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:25,215
It's a it's a local exit hold on

1179
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,175
It is a Sabian accurately lays out exactly the purpose of a show like Alex's would serve

1180
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Some of the groups

1181
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
They do exist

1182
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Useful purpose

1183
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,623
Either for the newcomer who can be indoctrinated into the ideology

1184
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Give the struggle

1185
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,207
Or for generating positive propaganda to reach

1186
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Essential freedoms

1187
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
So it's almost like in this essay

1188
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
He's explaining what Alex Jones is

1189
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Purpose would be

1190
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,167
Proud boys

1191
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,959
Generator

1192
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,239
What positive property

1193
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,847
He whitewashes a ton of hateful rhetoric a bunch of

1194
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
Dominative

1195
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Any

1196
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Turns them

1197
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Things

1198
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
People could use an entry

1199
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,527
Three-point and we seat like Robert.

1200
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Kids podcast

1201
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
He did a

1202
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Study

1203
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
He's got a lot of chat logs

1204
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
Discord server

1205
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
They were all discussing

1206
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
It's super

1207
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
Hi number

1208
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,103
Alex Jones is a palatable entertaining

1209
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
Very talented broadcaster

1210
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
Can you get in with

1211
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
And then eventually

1212
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
Either turn on him because you think

1213
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,015
He's not talking about the

1214
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
The Jewish question

1215
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,111
Or something like that

1216
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
Do you go to someone more extreme

1217
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,815
Leaderless resistance as they he's talking about the idea of

1218
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
This can be useful

1219
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
Purpose for the newcomer who can be indoctrinated

1220
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
The ideology of the

1221
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
The struggle

1222
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:04,287
The idea that Alex is saying that we use a leader list

1223
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
Resistance

1224
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
After this essay

1225
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
Call Wildfire

1226
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
In

1227
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
Malaysia community

1228
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,479
I know that he's read that paragraph

1229
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,295
I don't know why do I don't know what to think

1230
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,159
I think he has influenza

1231
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
Probably has family members who either are or are they

1232
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:31,423
I know I know

1233
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
With his

1234
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
Family

1235
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,775
That he likes to brag about

1236
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
Where he live

1237
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,295
Highly improbable for him.

1238
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,415
An extended family member

1239
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
He said he's related to

1240
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Bedford Forrest

1241
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
The guy who started

1242
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,935
He's he's been

1243
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
For a long time

1244
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
There's like what I get when I heard that

1245
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
It was very trouble

1246
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
To me because

1247
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,431
Vegas Vacation

1248
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
Probably

1249
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
This episode totally

1250
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
The whole time we were at the BMV

1251
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,511
We're at the Grand Canyon

1252
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,327
See the Grand Canyon

1253
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,215
Alarm

1254
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Yeah

1255
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Sorry

1256
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,847
But there's an underlying

1257
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
That sort of

1258
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,967
The ideology that philosophy

1259
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,527
Behind

1260
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
You know that's the guy he is

1261
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
Maybe we got the wrong

1262
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
In front of his dad

1263
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
Maybe he's not a

1264
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
CIA agent

1265
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,535
Maybe the KKK

1266
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,375
Possible

1267
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
Toothbrushing ilysm

1268
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,103
So to answer your question about the show

1269
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,151
Clips

1270
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:20,479
Can find of his show where it looks like more of a set

1271
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,783
Saint Austin

1272
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Community Access

1273
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,599
Yeah

1274
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
Which is just hit a black

1275
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,487
Like cuz he's filming amid his dad's Dental

1276
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,815
Corner of the dental office

1277
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
With one light

1278
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:44,031
I think there's some there's more sincerity

1279
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
Visually

1280
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Compilation

1281
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
The street

1282
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,551
And stuff like that he needs to get back to his roots

1283
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
He said he's in his

1284
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Recording studio Castle

1285
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,999
From time to time

1286
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
Get back to the Box

1287
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:16,799
I don't know it's

1288
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
Think of him having a tea

1289
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
TV show on cable access

1290
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,223
I somehow can't get past the idea of like you

1291
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,759
And he's got it

1292
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:32,671
And he's got the little end table to the left of them Amore Styles what are the only Clips you can find

1293
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,719
And on YouTube is of his Halloween episode

1294
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,255
Like taking callers while carving

1295
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
Great it's only like a minute-long and

1296
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
So anyway this is interesting

1297
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,935
I think there's

1298
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
There's there's

1299
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,519
Questions that are raised by this

1300
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,311
Into the early career of Alex

1301
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,615
Sure better at the very least

1302
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Answered

1303
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
In 2009

1304
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
It seems like it

1305
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
But if

1306
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
It is weird to be like

1307
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
So

1308
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Different

1309
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
And things that are still the same

1310
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Funeral

1311
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,999
Yeah I was about to try calms all the time

1312
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791

National

1314
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,871
Doesn't need to go to the DMV anymore you can mail in your registration and get a new license that way

1315
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
I don't know maybe you need to stop

1316
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943

And blood testing

1321
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:46,143
I think you'll be ready to hire a phlebotomist

1322
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,935
Phlebotomist

1323
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,519
I needed

1324
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
To go back to the past

1325
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Present

The physical DMV in

1333
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,983
Columbia Missouri

1334
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
Biggest hassle in the world

1335
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,103
So it was like all the jokes about that

1336
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
BMV

1337
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
Whatever I lived

1338
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Sucks

1339
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,831
And then when I moved here I needed to get a new IP I need an Illinois ID

1340
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
So I thought

1341
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
How bad it wasn't Colombia

1342
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,207
Going to the DMV in Chicago

1343
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,303
Worst I went in and out of there

1344
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
Was anybody protesting

1345
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,703
Not at all

1346
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
Needing to get a new ID

1347
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
Expired

1348
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Nightmare

1349
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:03,711
Partially my fault

1350
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,271
Difficulty that you would be mad at them

1351
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
But it was my fault for not having the right information

1352
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Partially

1353
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:16,255
Laser.

1354
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535

1355
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
Absolutely

1356
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119

Performance Bike

1378
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743

1379
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Actually make a movie

1380
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791

Like 80s

1388
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
Joke setup

1389
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,759

1390
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575

You don't know that for sure somebody falling

1397
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:44,991
We can reasonably assume that no one died that day

1398
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,671
It was not great

1399
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
