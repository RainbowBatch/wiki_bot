11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840

Yorgos

Alex Alex

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
Scary royalty political power Brokers

To a secret meeting that will last all weekend

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Is known as the Bilderberg Group cuz they're objecting be worlds

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
There was a time whenever every newscaster had to have that kind of Ted Koppel voice

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
What who talks like you

26
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
Alex Jones evidence

27
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
That the Bilderberg Group is

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
Looking for world domination all you have is a news reporter thing

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,512
Is it because assholes

30
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
Every four years Bilderberg Meats in North America

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
And in June of 2006

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
This is multiple articles for 2003 the last one was from 2015 hairstyle trends

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
The capital of Kenya

34
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Push-up

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
A long history

36
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
A meeting of the minds Daniel estulin

00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
Very excited to tell you about it

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
He's a he's almost as fun as Leo zagami

39
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Not as fun

40
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
As our friend

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Hammurabi

42
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
WhatsApp

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
Hamamoto

44
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
I jokingly reassure my cameraman

45
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
But the horror stories we read about

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
We're probably exaggerated

47
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
We do reporters get

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
Air Force people aren't let in

49
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
We do people get

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Check the jail house in 34 hours

51
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
It happens every time

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Well

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
Bilderberg

54
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Pressure put on them

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
By the government

56
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Security and that's why all this

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
If I was told that

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
If you like cocaine

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
I scoured all Wrecker

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Yesterday an hours today

61
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Trying to

62
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Find something

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,328
It was just scary I'm in again I've been all over the world and I've never seen anything like

64
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Hours

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Nation what are you here for

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Reenactment

67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
In a while

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
Lifetime

69
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
I was answering all the questions

70
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
They told me earlier

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
You guys showed up

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Everything

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
A plan

74
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,632
Jim Tucker

75
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
I want first

76
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Not a good plan

77
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
So

78
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
The only thing I can find about Alex being

79
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Detained biking

80
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Costumes

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Is an article 4

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
Written by Paul Joseph Watson

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Prison Planet

84
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
And I want you to raise your hand

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
When you hear the point

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Little bit out of place

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
In this report

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Quote

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Customs openly told Alex as soon as they brought him into custody that the Bilderberg Group of the wear of his arrival and that this was

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
The reason for his detainment

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
I forgot that there's multiple point

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,151
All three members of the team were instantly detained despite going through different immigration

93
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,551
Officials knew everything about Alex even the fact that George W bush once had him arrested in 1998

94
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
He yelled something at a press conference and police escorted them out

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
He pretends that he got a ride

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
So it wasn't like George W bush from his Ivory Tower said arrest that man it was like Alex

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
And they were like we can't have

98
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,359
Gotcha I was cussed at I was interrogated

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Jail threats were issued his officials seized and searched

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
Through Alex's equipment for 15 hours

101
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,623
He was told that if any trace of pornography was found on his three computers that he would be arrested

102
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Is that a thing that I wasn't wearing

103
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
No

104
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
I don't believe so don't you think

105
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
The little specific specific

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Correctly

107
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Canadian officials

108
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
1

109
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,431
No following

110
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Nope

111
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,575
If you were

112
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Memories

113
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
I think there is some sort

114
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
It's like the customs office

115
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
You don't want anybody bring it in the outside

116
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
Season p***

117
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
Immigrations officials seem to take a gleeful satisfaction in

118
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Claiming they were Liars

119
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Despite one admitting to having seen Alex Jones

120
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Documentary

121
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,039
And he still said that he wasn't

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Accusations of drugs and weapons smuggling were throwing around without recourse

123
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,559
You American s*** all over us Canadians and take you can do anything you want to US immigration

124
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Acting like a drill sergeant

125
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
I don't believe the story at all

126
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
I think Alex Mista

127
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
Reply I don't know I think that's what happened

128
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,407
Showed up with a reason why I got

129
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
P****

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
It's ridiculous. That's possible to

131
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Why he would make it that specific is they totally found support and he was like

132
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Call call

133
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Maybe catch some of the still arriving

134
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Life is so hard for you

135
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
Play

136
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Currently

137
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
The answer is 0 Elite

138
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,823
Pretty boring no Elites

139
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
Way more than once Alex is going to get into a conversation of where the property line

140
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Start

141
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
I should warn you about that high drama

142
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
What's up

143
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
What's happening in there right now

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
This happening

145
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,711
Screaming a lot today

146
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
Call Palmer Lake

147
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
What about any everybody else

148
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
About 10

149
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
They can be fine

150
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Later

151
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Is it in that order

152
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Typically big black cars

153
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Bulletproof

154
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
That's a stupid cat

155
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
We're being kept Welbeck

156
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
From the building by

157
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
No idea who this guy is

158
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Bmore security

159
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
Just a reminder

160
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Want

161
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
This is going to be a bit of the next like 10 minutes A lot of them taking pictures of people

162
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,703
Serenity courage

163
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
Literally nothing

164
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
In the morning

165
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
Insole of course I complied with they wanted I wasn't happy about it because I have been tired I drove a quite a long way you know

166
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
McDonald's

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,719
Can I just saw a bunch of security here and I was wondering what was going on and I asked questions

168
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
They said they were having a wedding or they were having some sort of reception

169
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
So I decided to tackle couple more questions and I thought it was kind of weird

170
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
Flashlight off the trailer over right now

171
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
We're also in front Giselle

172
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
Coleman it look like Coleman the hotel so I left

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,463
Where is this morning

174
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:19,007
Well I didn't have to wait because there's a proof of people out here telling me everything that was going on

175
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,175
They're not fooling anyone any longer when you've got this

176
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
And detaining Alex Jones in the Border

177
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
What does help build perfect peach

178
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
He probably started

179
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
I Just Brittany people through closed windows

180
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
What's the drama here is the narrative going to be

181
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
I'm breaking into the Bilderberg and then he find out all the information and then

182
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Good god no

183
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Like what are we doing here it doesn't evolve

184
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
There's no further he doesn't get in

185
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Alert

186
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
As well as the head of its steering

187
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
We look him up on

188
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Google

189
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,511
The kemetic he has B

190
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
In the last decade

191
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
The reporters

192
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,775
These rich people have

193
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,407
Has been covering the 3rd

194
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,991
Cowboy hat

195
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
The 2006 list

196
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Wearables 7:45

197
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
70s artists

198
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
7/2 more hours to go

199
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Stop possible

200
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Who is who is he

201
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
It's been 20 happy years with Metropolitan newspapers

202
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
All the wires are cricket nyyear

203
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
That could not happen without me knowing about it

204
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Both

205
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Was called

206
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
By the late fee Westbrook

207
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,671
This is fine cuz I was young once again has insert citation geography

208
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
More funny names

209
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Dammit

210
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,119
I found out about the Bilderberg Group for breeding Westbrook

211
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
Some fun stuff about Westbrook

212
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
50s and 60s

213
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
If I

214
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
From what I can see right now just on the

215
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
In the fifties R6

216
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
See this was an older white man

217
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
The name Westbrook

218
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
So I assume he was very Progressive on racing

219
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,463
Pegler heated FDR's New Deal and was aggressively Auntie Union

220
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,535
Call pegler compared to Union advocates

221
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Of the closed-shop to Hitler's Goose step

222
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
However pegler was showing some

223
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Nostalgia for the Third Reich

224
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,079
His proposal for smashing the AF of L in the CIO was

225
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Was for the state to take them over

226
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Yes I would DS that would be fascism he wrote but I detest fascism

227
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Such fascism

228
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,719
Which is great Advocate fascism

229
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Arguing

230
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
End racism

231
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Terrible idea

232
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
If the government were to take over

233
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Funny bring a braces

234
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
In the Civil Rights Movement

235
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:17,087
Bigotry

236
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
That's weird

237
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
He embraced the label races

238
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,631
Quote a common but false for Nazi used by the bigots of New York

239
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
Which is something that'd be alright says now

240
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Wait

241
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,639
That's that's an argument that the alt-right is co-opted now he was making that in 1950s

242
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
Only racist call you racist

243
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
He's a progenitor that ahead of the curve they also had

244
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,975
Because they hiss when they talk gulp down everything before them and fowl everything in their wake

245
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
I mean

246
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
That's

247
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Hopefully not how

248
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
It's not good for a call him

249
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
You can just make

250
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
Got up so early no juice do hair

251
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
What are you trying to be starting a meal he's trying to be an iconoclast

252
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
Actually his anti-Semitism has a very easily traced back

253
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Beginning

254
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
Vetted

255
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
50 semitism was based

256
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,999
Almost entirely on a 1949 libel case brought against Reynolds

257
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Who accused of being immoral and a coward

258
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Right

259
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Use very much guilty of libel

260
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
And the court found him guilty

261
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
You lost the case along with 170

262
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,039
Largest settlement

263
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Our largest punitive damage ever at that point

264
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
For libel

265
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
Phuc yea the lawyers the lawyers the case was guy named Louise on either

266
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
Stances that quote the Jewish World versus pegler

267
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Reminder pegler was

268
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Very guilty of life

269
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
So

270
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Columnist

271
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
He Woodbrook the laws

272
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
Buy Hurst publishing

273
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Well

274
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,975
He was fired by them in 1962 because he gave a speech that took the piss out of the Hearst Family

275
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
Are you started screaming about how they were a bunch of assholes and it was a Kitty toy and soda fountain company in all this

276
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Play fired him for the American opinion

277
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Go to put out by the John Birch

278
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Society

279
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,103
If you say all those words together in a sentence

280
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Beyond happy

281
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
Visiting to make you weirdly

282
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Maybe

283
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Just because it's so crazy

284
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,599
He was too crazy for the John Birch Society

285
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
Dealing with world-class stop writing

286
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Sunwager

287
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,215
There's one quote that I found by this guy columnist Hayward drone

288
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,287
Who wrote about Westbrook pegler

289
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
This quote was really

290
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
The video of Jay Westbrook pegler

291
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
Consists of the fact that he is not the man he

292
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
He's infected Naughty by Nature

293
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
His sympathies are

294
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
When he's aroused about some

295
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
Wrong you can be more eloquent than any newspaper man I know

296
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
The point is that okay

297
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
It just reminds me of Allah

298
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
He's not the man any presents

299
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Himself to be

300
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,775
Whenever he gets aroused by native superstitions and ancient wrong

301
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
He ends up being super eloquent having the great talent

302
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
That is just

303
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,039
I read that and I thought that's my boy Alexandra

304
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Was an a******

305
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Totally

306
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
History

307
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,511
Tracks with that about

308
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
I kept their horrendous I couldn't find any complete columns but I found a lot of excerpts of

309
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
You transformed over time

310
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
After that night

311
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
1849 lawsuit you got

312
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Way worse

313
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,455
Before he even voted for the first time around

314
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Inclination

315
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Towards moderate

316
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
Rap battle

317
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
Weird

318
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
The end I

319
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
In WWII

320
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Like you wrote columns

321
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
Allegorically talked about how like

322
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,679
Well yeah buddy we wasn't advocating against

323
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
How everybody was doing it

324
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,103
Like you can't be practicing that form of popular anti

325
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,967
He was the first guy was like dude I've been doing this the right way you guys f******

326
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
What is this

327
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
Pissy little bulshit

328
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,207
Is Teddy a strip

329
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,535
We're not going to

330
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
In the first place

331
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
That's a real anti-Semitism right that's good exactly

332
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,103
He was writing about the Bilderberg Group 1950 whatever doesn't really

333
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
True

334
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
To go on a 27-year crusade

335
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
To find out nothing and write fanfiction about them

336
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Make me

337
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Credibly sad

338

Chain-smoking and red bunk half the time

Identify

364
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319

00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
True at all

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
It's very clear whatever You Like It Is

378
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,312
You just making up lore

379
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
It's so clear that

380
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
You're already making of everything else I can go For Broke

381
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Play however you want

382
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,928
It's literally as you like it in the epilogue

383
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,768
Are you want

384
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,584
What is not a random night

385
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Play

386
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
So that's how

387
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
The Bilderberg

388
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,288
Play back to the hotel

389
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
For half a century.

390
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
But they decide they have to be

391
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Systemically every year

392
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
I will pay me today

393
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Throughout the year

394
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Is great footage

395
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
Something that looks like an episode of cops where everybody is just bored

396
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,840
Something I don't know if they cover is the fact that they always

397
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
Like the Bilderberg Group always

398
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
At a hotel that has a golf course

399
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
Golf is the metaphorical symbol for

400
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
That's why

401
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Rory McIlroy

402
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
The devil

403
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,720
I think we proved that it Bilderberg 4:32 I remember

404
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
Tiger Woods

405
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Get back

406
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,896
Central footage the riveting

407
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,224
Are you sure we're going in the right direction footage

408
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,088
I would have

409
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
Inside right now they're deciding

410
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Whether or not there will be a citation needed

411
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,192
They are

412
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
You got one app

413
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
The Bible

414
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
Scrubs and learned nothing

415
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
His hand

416
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,120
120

417
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
Lighthouse State

418
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
People are selling the world agenda

419
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Okay

420
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
The reason they want a Christian

421
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
They're doing evil evil is done under the cover of Darkness

422
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Sunshine

423
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Trite

424
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Aphorism

425
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
Secret things are going private

426
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
Everybody good

427
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Sure yet thank you

428
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Again I need you to stay right on the sidewalk

429
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
Thank you

430
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Also

431
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Mustaches

432
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Information

433
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
All we need

434
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Your crisis

435
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,496
Spell becoming a pattern

436
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,688
A lot of that's a bad sign

437
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
There's a big crisis

438
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,016
Crisis doesn't sound like

439
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
We need to recognize

440
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:06,208
Problem reaction

441
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
You got that quote from David Rockefeller

442
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,800
That everything that Alex has said is true damn confirm that right now

443
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
So this is a quote that got around a bunch of

444
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,504
Conspiracy sites pretty much forever as long as

445
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
Part of a larger quote

446
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Conspiracy sites

447
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,464
And it's the present window of opportunity

448
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,328
Order might be built will not be open for long we're on the verge of a global transformation

449
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,168
All we need is the right major crisis and the Nations will accept the New World Order

450
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
This is not real

451
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,312
Almost entirely fake quote

452
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,688
There is a video of David Rockefeller giving speech to the Business Council of the UN

453
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,016
This is the actual quote

454
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
This present window of opportunity with

455
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,232
During which a truly peaceful interdependent World Order might be built

456
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Will not be open

457
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
For too long

458
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
Already there are powerful forces that work

459
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,632
At work that threatened to destroy all of our hopes

460
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
It's just feel like it's not the same

461
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
You know what's one of the funniest thing

462
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
Is that the end

463
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
Entire video

464
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
David Rockefeller speech which

465
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,576
Doesn't include this you can find it on

466
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
Infowars

467
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,184
No edited out

468
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Is too good a damn selves

469
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,984
That would that would be like every like sweeping Zelma George

470
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
You're keeping mysterious this is a completely fictionalized fabricated quote

471
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
Alex Jones his own website

472
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Debunk

473
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
His claims

474
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,272
Like I said in the bibliography

475
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Because it does

476
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
512

477
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Hilarious

478
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
This is this is a disaster

479
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Like

480
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
There's like

481
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
Well is the disaster dance already disaster I think this is only going to last for another

482
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Yeah probably

483
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
20 minutes

484
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
So you might not survive this no idea

485
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
One of my friend

486
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
Renee

487
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,584
I'm from don't be at the Bilderberg meeting

488
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
But I'm against the bilderbergers

489
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Sister fight for my freedom site for my rights

490
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,544
Make sure the picture in a free country

491
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
I've been doing this for last

492
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
15 years ago because

493
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Last year

494
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,208
It took me 14 and a half hours to get to Munich

495
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
I was pulled off the plane in the land was full of a plane and doing it could be interrogated

496
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
4 hours

497
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
On both lights

498
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
I was able to call a friend a journalist then

499
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
In Rome as a result of his presence than others

500
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,568
Calling report mystery farming in Italy it they'd back off and let me go

501
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
Everyone seems to have that story

502
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:41,760
Then they're background of like oh my God

503
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,832
None of it can be verified

504
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
I have not

505
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Can't do it now

506
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,440
I would never even try

507
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
So Daniel estulin

508
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Even

509
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
Call the wing Bilderberg 415 here

510
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
Tucker

511
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
How do you say

512
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Feel about what

513
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,544
Very big

514
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
Everything else in my life is going horrible

515
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
But at least I have this

516
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
What they do is they do the same stuff that Alex data Ridge

517
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
Finally Rich was like is like Shield Survival Products

518
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Stuff like that blog

519
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Some stuff like that

520
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Living off.

521
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,400
Just trying to create this book that are super Sensational like

522
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
Reportedly covering Bilderberg for 15 years yet so ridiculously never actually come out with any real information

523
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,456
Hard-to-get mostly just official sounding sentences speculation and every now and again

524
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Princes of document

525
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
To make it seem legit

526
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
Heard about that you wrote a book called the true story of the Bilderberg Group in a review of the book for the Seattle Times

527
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Bruce Ramsay said

528
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
Harry Potter

529
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:01,376
A special group of in-the-know

530
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
Mixing fact

531
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
With assertion

532
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,008
So the Casual readers won't tell them apart

533
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:11,616
Is the person you know you want it

534
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
Impeach and be is a known Wicked

535
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
It's all you're doing is speculating throwing around random

536
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Being a Nazi is bad

537
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
But I agree with all the things that Nazis

538
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
But I don't feel bad so I'm going to call this guy

539
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Who doesn't do all the things

540
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
I know not

541
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
I'm going to call him a Nazi

542
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Even though

543
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Really like me

544
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Super cool

545
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
White supremacy that soup

546
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
But this Rockefeller guy

547
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
He is not

548
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
He's such a Nazi

549
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,272
Some of the sources quoted in his book The Truth About the Bilderberg Group

550
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:58,976
Include passages from the far-right anti-semitic American free press and the spectator

551
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,656
And also

552
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
Who's on his own website begins

553
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Oh this is

554
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,384
Don't get ready for this

555
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,992
See happen about how Prince Barnard

556
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
A member of

557
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
This

558
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Nazi

559
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Organization

560
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
Basically just a writing

561
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
Korean Club

562
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
For really rich people to ride out the war

563
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,704
It was one of those things that you shouldn't have done that but after the war he did a lot of Auntie Nazi efforts and he was

564
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
He hasn't

565
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,872
How many of the worst part of your association with Nazis is riding horses I guess that

566
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
Comfortable with it but the idea but I guess if you're

567
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Just riding horses

568
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
You still riding

569
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,440
In terms of like really benign things that happened during the Holocaust like

570
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
U-joint

571
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Some organization

572
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
To give you stature in that people leave you alone

573
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
Right

574
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
I think it's not the right

575
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Thing to do but it's not evil

576
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,800
And I think you have a pretty wide berth to people in the middle

577
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
World wars

578
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,712

579

But if I was post-war efforts has shown him to not

584
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,000
If I'm in that situation and I got the money

585
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
And somebody's like okay

586
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
You can either be part of the Nazi

587
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
And you can start doing the whole

588
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,080
Or I thought you were doing the post you could learn

589
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,248
But it's along those lines

590
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
Was I evil

Number one thing

685
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,200
Felony offense for any member of the federal

686
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
To meet with members

687
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,576
Without the express Authority an authorization

688
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
President or congress

689
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184

00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
Citizens not talk

691
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
It is illegal for members of the government

695
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
For this reason

696
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Many prominent politicians attend

697
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
What their names do not appear

698
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,712

Does appear on the list

702
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
Governor isn't a federal

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
State position

704
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Pretty much exactly the definition of

00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
Head of the state government

706
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424

707
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
Crazy about

They're different

711
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:55,040
You think Alex would that have a robust appreciation of that

712
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856

00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
I would be so sardonic

723
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm sure they are a regular man with a hoodie I'm sure they are really hot

724
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
That's why we're here.

725
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:59,551
Do you think if they were angry there on the front page the local paper today think they're in there reading it right now Jim

726
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Oh yes I don't think

727
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
You're happy about it

728
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
I don't think

729
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
They prefer

730
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Absolute secrecy

731
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,031
Eiffel Tower

732
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,175
A slight variations my name and I don't know if I'll get it or not

733
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Also

734
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
It could happen today

735
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
The last 3 years

736
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
I get back home

737
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,183

I apologize

739
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,839
Sound effects

740
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Inefficient

741
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
Oh my God they really going to attack Iran

742
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
They didn't

743
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Fake laugh

744
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
I want to say that I did literally zero work

745
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
Into trying to come

746
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,447
Confirm whether or not these people are the people that claim to be taking pictures out

747
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,847
Because I felt like it just accepting all of them as

748
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,431
You got a picture

749
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199

750
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,623
Could even then what's the what's the good if you're like oh and by the way that picture that they're showing you right now

751
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,183
That's of Dave in 80

752
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,999
I made the point of the Gabriella precede one because it's a

753
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
It's a drastic editing mistake

754
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
Harassment

755
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
It will never get too hard for us

756
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
The forces that we have inside

757
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
I thought my sources

758
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,479
Some sources include space command

759
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
People who are actually working for them the Secret Service the second layer

760
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,135
People in the Bill of Riverside the

761
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,719
VIR the clerk's the administrative office

762
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
There their day

763
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,351
They are our eyes and ears and every time

764
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
There's something else we always get into

765
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Let's

766
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
It's not

767
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
Baptized

768
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,639
What does real

769
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
I thought you were saying that's why I

770
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:52,607
The best name so far

771
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
The staff The Kooks the shafts

772
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:00,287
When we actually get here what song is this

773
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
To make sure that we get information

774
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:13,599
What information of decorum system is unfair this documentary

775
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Make sure that all information

776
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
Checks out a lot of the stuff ability

777
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Information make sure that

778
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,255
Spell this dish information nullifies

779
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
Leavv accuracy

780
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,591
Reusing the exact same

781
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:43,039
He's going to go around that

782
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
Had to take the 20 seconds to replay that

783
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,279
Almost cry over that

784
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
These decisions are made and taken

785
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Buy very elite group

786
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
People behind closed doors

787
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
This year the books

788
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
Suite hotel

789
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
We are not privy to

790
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
Talking about bad will definitely feel the concert

791
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
West Covina

792
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,943
1 events which apparently by accident seemed to happen

793
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
If I give your plan right here this year at brookstreet hotel

794
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
8 + 11

795
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,951
What does it do when you get 120 together to have meetings with government

796
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Beneficial

797
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
That

798
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
That's amazing

799
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Planning the cooperative

800
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
Planning the Democrat

801
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Cumin

802
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
Mussolini

803
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
The definition is when the interest

804
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,711
Joshua

805
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Bashas

806
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
Variety

807
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Tickle what

808
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,903
Set a timer.

809
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Drive to take

810
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
Complete

811
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
End of Watch

812
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
BMW

813
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
The irony of all this kind of talk

814
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,215
Is that when you actually go and read the doc

815
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
From like the club of Rome were there

816
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Council on Foreign Relations

817
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
Is the idea of the need for it

818
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
Inform

819
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
And the need for public consent

820
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
And to do things

821
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,319
Despicable

822
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
He's in his Narrative of them

823
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
That's what they have to do the reason he can find it in the

824
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:35,679
Papers is because they have to let you know the rob you of it

825
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
To consent to that

826
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,055
Do you think they're trying to take away

827
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
That they have to have it

828
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:47,711
This is a schizophrenic game that's no fun exact

829
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
It's the definition of of poorly read documents and paranoia

830
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,671
The romance

831
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Is that

832
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Alex gets

833
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
To feel like he's living in his own

834
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,679
No

835
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,775
Daniel estulin

836
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Is like

837
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,807
Like I'm writing a spy novel or Kerry Cassidy Project Camelot

838
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
Like that

839
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,207
Interesting concept

840
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,607
Other performance art concept interesting as anything that actually really damages

841
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,935
It's really really f***** up what else would you describe

842
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
For that reason

843
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,711
You remember whenever River Phoenix Joaquin

844
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,647
My man got a bullhorn

845
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,191
The article about having a megaphone

846
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
Jerked off to that

847
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
That his

848
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,591
Might be a prop

849
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Is

850
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
Entirely made up of that article

851
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,719
Another one

852
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,631
Is like a week later

853
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,991
Blind

854
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
You're in Canada as our founders of Canada

855
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,887
1776 call upon God

856
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
Feel like he does not have a

857
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Solid grasp

858
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
Without 1776 happen

859
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
73

860
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
So now

861
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,559
This is going to be a very big piece of Alex's cosmology

862
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,839
What he just said right

863
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
America

864
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:58,175
What do you think about Kissinger riding at 80% of the population should be killed in night

865
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
1973

866
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Kissinger would

867
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
The population of

868
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Chance I think

869
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
He was smart enough

870
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Not to write it

871
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
Refrigerator to do list

872
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,303
Kill 80% of the population

873
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
This is Alex Jones intentionally misrepresenting

874
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
Global biodiversity assassin

875
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:31,967
The 90s and referenced back to something that was written in the seventies Alex's

876
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Bring up his dates entirely

877
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
In contrast dustrial world today in among the large middle classes of the developing World consumerism

878
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Is all-pervasive

879
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
Andy Devine's what cost

880
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
The Good Life

881
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,863
Whitaker in Lykens in a report from 1975's

882
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Estimated that an agricultural world

883
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
In which

884
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,007
How many words into that do the Galaxy

885
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Contract

886
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,223
1975 Vandervoort they wrote it estimated that an agricultural

887
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
World in which most human beings are peasants

888
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,343
Should be able to support 5 to 7 billion people

889
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
Probably more at the large agriculture

890
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,439
Agricultural population

891
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
Were supported by an industry promoting

892
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
Agricultural activity

893
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,631
In contrast a reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society

894
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,215
At the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion

895
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,567
European standard of living billion would be possible

896
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
These figures represent not just

897
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
Contrasting material demands

898
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Of developed

899
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,247
And developing but also their contracted dietary habits

900
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
So Alex is misrepresenting

901
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Intentionally

902
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,159
It was Kissinger making a reference to a study from 1975 that discusses

903
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
The two researchers

904
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
Even though

905
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,815
Really really wrong

906
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
If it's not it's not strictly

907
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,751
The point of it is still salient

908
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
Disgusting

909
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
The carrying capacity for dick

910
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Modes of consumption

911
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
More than anything else the reference that was made

912
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
When's you to the proper context

913
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
Is more than anything a critique of modern

914
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
American levels

915
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
The consumption

916
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,647
More to the point the quotes that Alex constantly uses to make

917
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
Argument RJ

918
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Made up

919
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
The idea that

920
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,839
But in no way in the biodiversity assessment does Kissinger or

921
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
Anybody else

922
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
You should kill 80% of the population

923
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
Just because

924
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495
Capacity for the entire world

925
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,359
If the entire world were consuming at the rate that North Americans do

926
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:39,199
That would be 1 billion

927
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
Throwing everything away that run American

928
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
It's it's not

929
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
It look as much as I want everybody to die

930
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,815
Population is not the issue that we're facing

931
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
No I mean either or it's only an issue

932
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,471
How many koala

933
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,031
Because we have Nations that refused

934
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
To share anything

935
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,871
What if we f****** did anything

936
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
Anything along those lines

937
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
You find out that we have more than enough calories to support

938
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
12 billion

939
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,367
We don't f****** do it because some people got to be rich

940
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
Beer that is a that

941
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:25,023
That's one way of approaching the problem other people approach the problem in terms of

942
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,095
You know if there were

943
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Much more

944
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Caloric

945
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,959
Availability and trying to

946
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
To hoard

947
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
Riches and wealth

948
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
You would end up with

949
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
The massive booming population

950
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
Eventually you would get to the point where it wasn't

951
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
So

952
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
It's pretty

953
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,271
I think I think it is still reasonable to look at the population

954
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
An issue with a preemptive

955
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
But be that as it may

956
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Neither did KISS

957
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
The point is

958
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,535
That the biodiversity one of those remains

959
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,167
If I can prove the Kissinger didn't

960
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
That's not what he was at 4

961
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Yeah

962
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:18,527
Hey Alex

963
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
What you think about

964
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,647
The guy you think wants to kill 80% of the population of a meeting

965
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
We need to have like a clue style murder mystery

966
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,303
That's right

967
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
You invite your Kissinger

968
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,679
You get Dick Cheney he's invited to

969
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
You get Trump

970
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
And then at the end everybody's dead

971
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
I really don't care what happens in the middle or whether or not they all go to a house

972
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
I just want all of those people this is more of a reverse murder on the Orient Express

973
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
That's been noted

974
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,463
Make image in the paws of this the only part I really wanted to make is that Alex Jones

975
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
Intentionally misquoting

976
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
And misrepresenting

977
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,839
This report there was only discussing

978
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
Theoretical carrying capacities of different races

979
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Consumption

980
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
And

981
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
In no way was it

982
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Prescriptive

983
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
It was descriptive

984
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
In language

985
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,079
Talking about

986
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:18,943
Studies that existed 20 years prior not saying you should do any

987
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
Fair enough with mega haunted house

988
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:31,487
Yelling all of this hotel

989
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
He's got to keep his better up

990
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Dad

991
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
The audio do I like

992
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,959
Call gyna megaphone

993
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,751
I wish

994
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,567
Tiger documentary through a megaphone

995
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,871
Water

996
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,687
You getting real specific

997
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,111
I think the reason he's doing this and why he had them

998
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903
But take a picture of him with a megaphone

999
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
For the paper I just realized

1000
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,767
Is probably because in Waking Life

1001
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,095
He's riding around in the car with a megaphone

1002
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,911
I think it's probably so to capitalize Monday

1003
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Nikki also screw

1004
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
You should always be screaming

1005
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Quite frankly

1006
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,807
The radio Studio takes away a lot in the capabilities of

1007
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Megaphone

1008
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:46,495

1009
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
From the Alamo Jesus

1010
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,103
These people aren't even interested

1011
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,759
Girl girl

1012
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:02,367
But then I would still let slogan for the European you've made it on the show

1013
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:09,535
Gravity Falls the protocol of the meeting list

1014
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:13,375
Gustav affidavit it out there told exactly how they're supposed to

1015
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,959
Behave themselves meaning of they can never address the attendees

1016
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,007
Bergen ever speak to the Molester spoken to

1017
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,543
The first they're going to look him in the eye

1018
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,599
And needless to say all the information that is being spoken and doing a conferences

1019
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,183
Is under no circumstances allowed to come out that's what they're told

1020
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
The threatened

1021
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975

1022
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279

1032
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
I told him

1033
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
See if you see a cackle

1034
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215

1035
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
Talk to your attacker

1036
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,335
I would have at least hope for a middle

1037
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
He didn't even

1038
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
A man ought to give him one big meal

1039
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,807
4

1040
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
We got them

1041
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,911
He was walking really think they're proven something

1042
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983

These latest usually are protected by the Mossad

1052
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
That's why they would be Auto police

1053
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
In this case

1054
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311

01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,127
We wanted to downtown Auto

1134
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,175
And talk to locals

1135
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:21,503
This is great

1136
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,903
This is good, Dee this is good comedy

1137
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
Come on

1138
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:35,839
Alex has no jobs

1139
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
I just need to tell you that

1140
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
I just met

1141
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Canada under control your sovereignty

1142
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,519
Merging you with the US and Mexico

1143
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Tell you about this

1144
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,455
This is deadly serious I'm just letting you know I'm telling you about it

1145
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
As they say they're the guys that run the world

1146
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
They make decisions

1147
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
Wait and we just carried out

1148
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,679
Leave them alone

1149
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,551
Close to half of the people we randomly spoke to

1150
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:33,951
My arm in between the doors and they wouldn't let me

1151
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
Really overcast day

1152
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
Batman

1153
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
We don't want to happen

1154
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,031
Because the Bilderberg Group runs the world

1155
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
Do Canadians or Warriors

1156
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
But most of this

1157
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Is public knowledge

1158
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,807
Polite

1159
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
Wikipedia

1160
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,183
World leaders are re-elected

1161
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Circle

1162
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,215
Address for a group in 2003

1163
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
Because my

1164
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,567
Center politics without becoming

1165
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
A part of the Bilderberg Group

1166
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,407
And then you find out that

1167
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Is the case that

1168
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,807
Bill Clinton went there.

1169
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Blair

1170
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,415
Who we think that we're electing

1171
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
L

1172
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,487
Our have already been

1173
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,047
Whether it's liberal or a conservative

1174
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,839
They're already part of the group

1175
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,263
Salem horses

1176
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
Diaries

1177
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
It's two different

1178
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Party

1179
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
How late is doing

1180
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,407
Like Bill Clinton

1181
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
The bushes

1182
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,295
I imagine part of that is polite

1183
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,367
Imagine another part of it is they have

1184
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Unique

1185
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,415
Life experience

1186
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
No one else can share

1187
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
And that they were presidents of the United States

1188
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,607
And the public

1189
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,935
But can you imagine what kind of pressure that puts on a person

1190
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:23,007
Like f****** George W bush had to go into weird

1191
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,799
Therapy

1192
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,335
Yeah that's what happened

1193
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,895
Furious that we allowed him to keep his hands

1194
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:35,551
But The Vig

1195
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,183
I put the idea in some way is not

1196
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,487
Suspicious to me at all

1197
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,119
It should all stay

1198
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:53,983
Dragon

1199
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,639
Subterfuge Machiavellian backstabbing

1200
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,711
And somehow The Lacs westerners

1201
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:09,087
That the government's fine to do wrong

1202
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
It's easy to me cheap

1203
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
Makes it easier for everyone

1204
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,167
What's your view on losing canvas Opera

1205
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
You stay as it is

1206
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
And I lost

1207
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,543

1211
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047

1274
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:17,823

01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
It's not all the same meeting

1279
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623

I don't know that what he's saying is

1281
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,815
I don't know how you proved the negation of a secret meeting

1282
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
Like I can't prove a secret meeting didn't happen

1283
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:47,519
Could I have a secret meeting

1284
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
That's true

1285
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
It's not

1286
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,127
I don't I don't Endeavor to disp

1287
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Prove negative

1288
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:58,271
It's impossible from a logical standpoint

1289
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Disprove

1290
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,879
Negative

1291
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
Will just be

1292
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Confirmative

1293
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:10,815
What about negative

1294
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,863
My my

1295
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,215
Stration with a lot of these conspiracy theories always wind up being

1296
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,799
People going so far out of their way

1297
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,359
To do conspiracy looking s***

1298
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,663
When you could just do it like regular

1299
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,783
Do you mean those three countries

1300
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
We're meeting whatever it would be

1301
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,391
Totally within the regular meeting rules

1302
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
To have that meeting

1303
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,511
That maybe their work

1304
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
Maybe a lot of these documents

1305
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
It's were like

1306
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Public dock

1307
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:50,239
You could still follow them but they weren't they weren't public documents

1308
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,799
I see no real evidence

1309
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,895
So we just proved they have 32

1310
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,991
Robert pastor

1311
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,855
Hi Robert Pastor cuz he's written by Jerome corsi

1312
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:17,119

01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
North American Union

1314
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
His ideas were

1315
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,663
The best way to secure

1316
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:36,063
The United States today is not at our two borders with Mexico and Canada but at the borders of North America

1317
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
As a whole

1318
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:43,487

Nationwide

1325
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
This is

1326
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,359
Incredibly disgraceful

1327
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,383
Wolverines

1328
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Second

1329
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
What's

1330
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Huh

1331
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
Wait what

1332
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
No

1333
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,039
Danelle visit like

I'm not a person who super into the

1335
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,671
The function of the military

1336
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
But

1337
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
Alex is rhetoric

1338
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Incredibly

1339
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,815
Borders on nativist

1340
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,375
Xenophobic

1341
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
2 degree

1342
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,703
The right now what we have in our service

1343
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,287
This is 8% of the Navy's foreign-born 5% of all branch

01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
65000

1347
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:09,759
Immigrants serve in the armed forces and 37,000 250 you become naturalized citizen

1348
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Since 2001

1349
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,903
Armed services include born in other countries and non-citizens

1350
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,463
Often working towards

1351
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,351
The rhetoric of Alex's putting forth here it is incredibly stressful

1352
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Have you heard of the police situation

1353
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,191
Just read this

1354
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
This time it's quote here

1355
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,055
Ali noorani executive director of the national immigration

1356
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,871
Operates to work in the United States

1357
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,175
Has already undergone a thorough background check

1358
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,759
And will undergo even more screening in police application

1359
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,111
The security risk is a straw man he said

1360
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,511
This is about people who've gone through criminal background checks were meeting the very high standards that we set as a country to

1361
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
You want to serve and protect their community

1362
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
All this boils down to

1363
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
From Alex's mouth

1364
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,911
Availed

1365
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,471
Xenophobia white supremacy

1366
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
EBay blatant disrespect for people who are serving in our armed services

1367
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
Would I rather have somebody who is fought

1368
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
And Claude

1369
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,551
Struggled

1370
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
To get to where they are

1371
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Joining

1372
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
The police

1373
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Derek

1374
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
The assholes that I knew from fourth

1375
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Derek sucks

1376
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,351
Which one would I rather have in the police force

1377
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:34,751
Eric was a dick

1378
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,383
Maybe we better off if any undocumented immigrants that are

1379
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,199
I would prefer undocumented immigrants

1380
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,479
2BR police force

1381
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,759
Cuz then I know

1382
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
They're just as afraid as me

1383
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
Justice

1384
01:18:54,975 --> 01:19:01,119
Interesting line I'm not agree with you

1385
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,727
Domestic

1386
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,199
But they're cool by stealth

1387

Damage control mode

1388
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,623
Security and prosperity partnership quickly

1389
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:30,559
It is the only way that we can security and prosperity

1390
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,351

With their frustration

1399
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
The population has not bought

1400
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:18,176
She was here

She's kind of April 30th

1404
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
1007

1405
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
The security and prosperity partnership

1406
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
Secretive approach

1407
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
Set alarm the pub

Economic integration plan

1416
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Important

1417
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Remind

1418
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:01,184
I wish I could present on my way

Make it

1421
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,752
The BBC reported that the

1422
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
Us and EU

1423
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:24,480
Alex is trying to present that is some sort of super nefarious thing

1424
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
Trade Agreement

1425
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:31,904
We watched American Union

1426
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
You you

1427
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Are being created so they can be

1428
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
Emerge

1429
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
He's really f******

1430
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,304
I'm stupid because it doesn't

1431
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
Track at all

1432
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,680
Literally every country that's in the EU

1433
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
North America

1434
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,800
Okay second we're going to discount

1435
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,872
Secondly every single country that's in the EU

1436
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688
And would be in the North American you

1437
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Are already members of

1438
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,040
So the idea that you have

1439
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,368
You need to create even Luxembourg

1440
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,928
Yep doody ideas

1441
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:09,792
The idea that you need to create these two things you can merge them together

1442
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
Cuz he's going to bring it

1443
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,864
Yes

1444
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:19,008
The idea that you need to create these things to bring them together when all of the countries are already together in a

1445
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,032
Unified

1446
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,824
Global body

1447
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,128
It's goddamn like

1448
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,664
No it's it just doesn't

1449
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,272
Track and adding layers upon layers that don't need

1450
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,576
To be there this idea of the single Market

1451
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:37,184
Getting all that you actually read that article what it's talking about is the fact that

1452
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,512
The United States in the United Kingdom have a bunch of regulations

1453
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
Trade rules and laws

1454
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,376
And you do need when you're going to have trade agreements

1455
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
You need to discuss those things

1456
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,472
Right and see what they decided to do was create

1457
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,752
Bodywear in Lake

1458
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
Could negotiate

1459
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
The trade regulation

1460
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,616
Both side have to come to

1461
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,408
A harmonious

1462
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,432
Balance

1463
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,992
We're discussing the plot of

1464
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,832
Star Wars episode 1

1465
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,624
From the article

1466
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,464
The Pact is designed to boost trade and investment by harmonizing regulatory staff

1467
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,376
The two sides agreed to set up an economic Council to push ahead with regulatory convergence in nearly 40

1468
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,704
Including intellectual property Financial Services business

1469
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,984
And the motor in Des

1470
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
Because those are

1471
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,456
Yeah now the reality is over now it's probably it wouldn't be that in his Bonnet is that he doesn't forget anything

1472
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Things to be regular

1473
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,600
I'm so he's actually trying to complain about that but he knows that that's not a realistic

1474
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,744
Like he wants to say doesn't believe anything

1475
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,864
Think should be regulated but whenever something is unreal run regulator

1476
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,656
He's like somebody should regulate that

1477
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,728
Does everybody was against regulations are f****** stupid

1478
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,176
They were simply repeating what did they do

1479
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,712
And the EU

1480
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,368
Record states that the two blocks will aggressively push regulatory conversion

1481
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:18,048
35 torque conversion education

1482
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,608

Regulate

1484
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
We recognize that we have a problem

1485
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,264
Greenhouse gas

1486
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800
The equator is a globe

1487
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
We agree there is

1488
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,640
You need to stop

1489
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,712

1507
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,936
He said undermined

1508
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
UK

1509
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,128
Believe it up

1510
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,688
He wrote undermined

1511
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,808
That's beautiful little patio dirty but

1512
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,856
That's so beautiful

1513
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
Snooze.

1514
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
People do

1515
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
Undermine

1516
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
African Union

1517
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,816
African economic Granite early 1980s

1518
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,984
Government shutdown

1519
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,592
The African Union Army sir

1520
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Pro Controller

1521
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,504
But that's really not

1522
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,512
Nebulous concept of sovereign

1523
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,816
Like what does that mean

1524
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,096
Okay

1525
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,400
They're going to dissolve sovereign

1526
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:36,800
Now we're doing this breakdown of sovereignty now

1527
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
Sovereignty

1528
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Yeah

1529
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:44,224
What you don't you don't have any for your Stardust self-determination

1530
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,088
Dissolving everybody sovereignty

1531
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:52,928
What exactly is that okay

1532
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,464
What Russia's sovereignty

1533
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,584
Who gives a s*** Russian the Russian people don't have

1534
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,984
No really have you and I right now why would I give a s*** if

1535
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
If you dissolve

1536
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,616
South America's f****** the entirety of South America is now just South America

1537
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,944
And there's no sovereignty or whatever like what it what do I care

1538
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:22,624
All of our problems the problem that I'm experiencing

1539
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:30,304
It's in the government causes every single problem that we will ever have

1540
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,424
By just being a government we need to defend against

1541
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,752
Taking that government away from us

1542
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,568
Subway

1543
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,480
F*** the federal government but also don't

1544
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,296
Darren crouch on their ability to

1545
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
Exactly the argument really only works if you don't pay attention to that

1546
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,512
Works if you believe that there is

1547
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
Nefarious group behind the scenes

1548
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,656
To get rid of the sovereignty so they can

1549
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,728
Pull some sort of a scam and take over the world

1550
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
And that's just

1551
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,800
The reality is that the evidence

1552
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,616
Is not there for that

1553
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
You don't have borders

1554
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,016
Stop

1555
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
Being

1556
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Well it's the United States

1557
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Against

1558
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
And it starts being

1559
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
Is everybody who's not a globalist

1560
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,696
Everybody who is this

1561
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:36,096
And that's why

1562
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Rules

1563
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:43,520
The globalist keep you focused

1564
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:49,152
Against the global words like that

1565
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,456
I don't know it's nonsense

1566
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
So stupid

1567
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:02,208
Make it make sense for the only way I can make it make sense to tell you that it's about something else

1568
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:07,328
Four and a half of this and I've already lost my mind about something else it's not about

1569
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,608
It's about

1570
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,424
I just can't look at Tony Blair that wanted

1571
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,008
It's about

1572
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
I hate others

1573
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
Set alarm

1574
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,848
So if you were

1575
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,968
So the only way to make sense of opportunity

1576
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,504
It makes sense of all of these

1577
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,832
Often contradictory and nonsensical idea

1578
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,112
Is it

1579
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,904
You cut through all of the

1580
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
And you say

1581
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
The people that you're against

1582
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,280
Read

1583
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
Non-white

1584
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,120
You keep the people I see product

1585
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,936
The people that you are for

1586
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,472
Read white people

1587
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,264
Within a certain

1588
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
Space

1589
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,848
Everybody else can go f*** themselves

1590
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,688
Do you because you want a

1591
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,712
White Nation

1592
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
Of people

1593
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,760
You know

1594
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,464
Now back to this really quick about the Africa

1595
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,488
Communion

1596
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:15,168
Support globalist exploitation

1597
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,472
Escape my brain immediately cuz that doesn't make any

1598
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
Any f****** sense

1599
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,568
Well the second plank of the charter of the African Union is quote

1600
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:25,408
To defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity and Independence of its member states

1601
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
Looking like a

1602
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,200
Big priority

1603
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,760
Also the African Union is it

1604
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,320
It's not a perfect body

1605
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:36,928
Certainly a lot of it has to do with the history of exploitation

1606
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,024
Is perpetrated against African countries

1607
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,864
Ignoring of atrocity

1608
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Should have happened

1609
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,960
In Africa

1610
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:54,336
Ignoring them or of course

1611
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
Exacerbated

1612
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,712
But the idea like the troops of the African Union or a tool for globalist

1613
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
Exploitation

1614
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,784
I think I

1615
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Africa

1616
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,488
That was

1617
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
Even

1618
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
Hindered

1619
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Bye

1620
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
Outside by America

1621
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,448
We're only on the wrong

1622
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:25,568
We're batting a thousand

1623
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,896
I've got it

1624
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,224
I have a couple of examples where the African Union

1625
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:33,760
Did

1626
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,784
Great though

1627
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:43,488
Adama

1628
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,256
The president

1629
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
The Pogo died

1630
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
Empower

1631
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,168
Protests by the African Union that were saying this was a military coup

1632
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,008
I've been under Togo's Constitution the speaker Parliament initiates new election

1633
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,800
Election

1634
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Happy Hollow

1635
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,848
The song ended up winning

1636
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:03,712
But

1637
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,784
It was able to

01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,832
Cool back to Hunters

1639

By suspending the country's membership

1643
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,976
In the African Union

1644
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:19,072
They were able to use the international cooperation

1645
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,376
And The Leverage that implied by that

1646
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,192
To force military coup Hunters

1647
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,496
Into accepting the Democratic process

1648
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Crazy

1649
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:33,664
The afternoon was able able to force an election in Mali in

There their work

1652
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
There's there are

1653
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,136
Plenty of examples of times when they aren't being used

1654
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,416
Is globalist

Display Tatian tools

1656
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,744
But actually to reinforce

01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,280
Democratic principles

1658
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,840

Globalist

1662
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,264
Like it comes from a

1663
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,336
The people are like

1664
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,664
We got to stop these endless Wars guys maybe

1665
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,200
Chilled

1666
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,136
Comes cooperation

1667
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,952
Because at that point you realize it's already too late

1668
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,680
Also our children

Pacific Union

1673

01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
The three great regions

1675
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,136
Administrative convenience

1676
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,232
That's straight out of 1980 World Cup

1677
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,304
Yeah he's given his specific

1678
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072

Three nations that's literally straight out of night

1680
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:04,288
But you understand and predict Aldous Huxley

1681
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
You're just allowed to get that out there

1682
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,408

We talked about that already

1716
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:22,368
Everybody knows

Mobility going off

1725
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:57,696
Cuz then people will be able to f****** discover things or change their position and they will be able to contribute in a way that otherwise they wouldn't be able to catch

01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:30,880
Would even consider confiscating land of farmers and Ranchers

1756
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,440
And taking their homes away from

Security

1770
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:29,504
It's part of a plan for a North American integration being carried out by government and corporate Elites

1771
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,552
Congressional or voter approval

1772
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,464
They just found literally every clip of somebody saying Elite they could and then just try to handfasted in Chandler

01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,880
2000 years ago

1778
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
That's an expression

Arson

1789
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,960
I want to be clear

1790
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
I want to be clear

1791
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,008
Alex

1792
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,312
Pissed off about this highway

1793
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,360
And I don't understand

1794
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:07,808
Specifically yes and I have some complaints about the general highway system that will get into a little later

1795
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:10,880
Specific one all of his

1796
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Plants fall flat

1797
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,696
This trans-texas Corridor makes

1798
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
No sense why he

1799
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
He's mad about it

1800
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,048
It's just that it's boring company

1801
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:24,448
That's the only thing I can really imagine

1802
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,728
Instead is

1803
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,008
We should

1804
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,592
Federalizing allow the federal government

1805
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:37,248
Women the reality is clearly they had in that report there was open bidding and the Spanish company paid more than

1806
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:43,648
You're willing to pay

1807
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:50,048
American National

1808
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,584
Company gets involved

1809
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,984
But I'm not super thrilled because it's taking away my national sovereignty which is an abstract concept

1810
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,520
The government

1811
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:05,920
To get involved within a personal or something

1812
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:10,016
Companies with more prosperity

1813
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:16,416
In terms of the complaints about like this Mega Highway getting into people's

1814
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,488
Go to stop I am very sympathetic

1815
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
I do I do feel sympathy

1816
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:27,936
Now granted your response is also

1817
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,264
We're going to build this and it's going to go through your land and I put stuff

1818
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,568
I think that's an issue that needs to be

1819
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:38,688
I don't I don't think I'm not super comfortable with it but

1820
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,504
Biggest question

1821
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Can the people anytime that is

1822
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,560

1824
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,400
To go fuc yourself

1825
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,704
Either there is a

1826
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
Maybe it's

1827
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,288
Cuz I'm like two beers deep but there's a certain part of it

1828
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,336
This really attract

1829
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,104
Do to me today

1830
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,640
You should not be able to

1831
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,920
To own land

1832
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,456
Water are

1833
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,992
You shouldn't be able to own any of the

1834
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
The elements

1835
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
Probably

1836

Avatar Last Airbender

1837
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,192
Bipartisan

1838
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:40,128
If this super highway goes through all of these countries than their Birds

1839
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
It's been some sort of

1840
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:48,832
Interstate highways around National Highway

1841
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,880
Ridiculous

1842
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
Arguments for dick

Copy your notes need to figure out what the point of this is

1846
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
Greater than in Texas

1847
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,896
Texas is the Frontline

1848
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,712
8004

1849
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,760
Are being handed over

1850

The government company

1851
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:23,136
Foreign companies by the legislator

1852
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:28,512
Turn over complete control

1853
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,048
Government power

1854
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,096
Illegally transferred

1855
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,912
Unelected quasi-governmental regional board

1856
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,240
The circumvent local governments and the will of the people

1857
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:43,104
This point like a lot of I'm not coming in with a lot of like rebuttals

1858
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,640
The stuff beginning

1859
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Magic

1860
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,712
Roy just water off my back like a duck

1861
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,784
Cuz in the bibliography so much of the stuff is just like

1862
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,600
News reports about a road

1863
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:57,184
Belt or articles on Infowars

1864
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
I see a large group of a

1865
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,864
Angry old white people

1866
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,936
60% gray hair

1867
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
If there is

1868
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Nothing

1869
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:15,872
I know they're mad about this

1870
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,896
Old white people look

1871
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,920
Angry I feel like

1872
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:22,016
Whatever it is they're mad about we need to do

1873
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:27,648
It's interesting notes so far we have 95%

1874
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,464
Through this documentary so far has been

1875
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,232
Bizarre apps

1877
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,960
Alex Goes to Canada now

1878
