00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,688

00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288

Microwave gun

77
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,959

Today Jordan

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Part of my investigation

83
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
This thing is sprawling

84
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,551
2015

85
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
To join up with

86
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Team Trump

87
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
So far if you

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
Irish Times

89
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
24-hour

90
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
You got a full day ahead of you of figuring out what we've discovered

91
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
We're harder to binge

92
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,431
Just about everything else is no doubt about that

93
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
Be it to give you just like a brief recap what we found so far

94
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
Is that

95
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Ignore the idea that

96
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Trump is running for president

97
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,743
Then started talking wild s*** about him talking about how you knows

98
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
The Donald Trump

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
The frontman for a Consortium on the

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
East Coast he explicitly lays out mob connection

101
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Talks about how

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
He's in bed with the clintons

103
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Probably laundry

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
His track record is terrible

105
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
He's hooked up with dice

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
See people

107
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
And then out of nowhere

108
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
He's like

109
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
Stop talking s*** on Trump

110
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
The whole time he's enjoyed his rhetoric

111
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Any thinks the things

112
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
The Trump think about how

113
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
Mexican immigrants should be coming into the country and what have you

114
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,607
He likes it

115
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
I hate Hillary

116
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
So much he's willing

117
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
To be like you

118
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
From

119
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Ghetto what

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
June

121
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
So now we're into August

122
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,455
Yeah nothing is really evil his position is only become more

123
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
Hey keep saying things I like

124
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Because Alex is crazy it so Donald Trump

125
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Coming then

126
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Very much so happy with him

127
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Pushing that marriage

128
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,839
If you want the ramp off

129
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Exactly

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,727
That seems to be his position is I love Rand Paul I want him to talk like.

131
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Donald Trump

132
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,127
He's tried to get Jesse Ventura

133
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,967
Or at least be like not yet

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
He's also expressed

135
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Support for

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Ted Cruz

137
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,695
Support for two other Republican

138
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
What room is not running for president

139
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
He's all over the place

140
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Trump is the last thing on his mind

141
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Terms of

142
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
His horse

143
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
You know what it is

144
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Is kind of good

145
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
You think about

146
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Who else

147
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Could have been

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
Like imagine

149
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Authority

150
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Terri Andrews

151
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
A lot of

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Christian bulshit on top of

153
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,903
Will take I would rather have a

154
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
Ted Cruz will be able to get things done

155
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
Better Department

156
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
You know it would be

157
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
I think the machine would work

158
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
Work faster

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
No resistance from the gop's Trump is a bumbling f*** ingrown hair

160
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Escape from l.a.

161
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
America

162
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
We lose all cows

163
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
I want to talk about it

164
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
We can talk about it

165
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
I don't talk about l.a.

166
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
Today's investigation will cover the period from

167
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
August 27th

168
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Where we left off on August

169
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
6 last time

170
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Just September 1st

171
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
And I don't want to put too fine a point on it

172
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
I think I've cracked

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
I think

174
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
At the end of this

175
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Episode I will reveal a piece of information

176
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
I was unaware of

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Have you were unaware of

178
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
And I've not heard anybody bring up

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
And I think it explains

180
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Just about everything

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Okay that is a big clay I'm being a little bit too over-the-top

182
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Installment number six

183
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
You were like

184
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
I think I've got this one I know

185
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
That's the ever-evolving nature of his investigation

186
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
But this one

187
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
It gives motive

188
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
It gives opportunity

189
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
I think there's a lobster

190
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Let me tell you

191
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
It's not as

192
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Conspiratorial as

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Let's say

194
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
You know

195
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
Some ideas of like Putin funneling money

196
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Contacts

197
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
It's not according to Occam's razor

198
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Much simpler

199
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
I think

200
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
The next investigation that I'm totally wrong

201
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
This is something pretty big

202
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Alright let's do it

203
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
Start on August 27th

204
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
So Alex Jones

205
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Isn't that a weird place

206
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Because

207
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Virginia shooting

208
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
It just happened

209
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
And in the meantime he's also being a

210
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Tax by

211
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
A sheriff

212
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
And it becomes like

213
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
A really weird place where he's mad at top

214
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
But also love

215
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Was cops

216
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
And he's in the he's in a very strange dancing

217
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Space for a lot of this

218
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
It's time.

219
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Yeah in the first clip you talkin about how

220
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
The Sheraton

221
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Spokane

222
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Did come out

223
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
And said

224
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
That a lot of armor

225
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Vehicles that they have and heavy

226
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Is

227
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
To fight against

228
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Constitutional x-ray

229
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Malicious

230
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
Which is what they're more scared of

231
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,463
Terrorism Muslim terrorism is going to Spokane

232
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,327
It doesn't seem like a hard target

233
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
And that is what he has to say

234
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
This is wrong and others picked it up

235
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
He first came out and said we're Liars it's not for us

236
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,175
Then we should know you're a liar so he said Alex Jones

237
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Anybody

238
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Something's about to happen

239
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
Really see this is a prime false flag zone

240
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,471
Common Sense tells me

241
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
USAA Insurance around real bad person

242
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
He speaks with a forked tongue

243
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
I may just go to accounting nearby when I go out there

244
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Is jurisdiction with with the history of his deputies

245
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
This is a

246
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,495
I'm not sure I'm speculating there but

247
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,895
Keep that in mind his feelings on this Spokane Sheriff

248
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
Another guy

249
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,951
Spoiler alert it's Sheriff Clarke

250
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Yeah

251
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Alex loves

252
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Why aren't these people in jail forever

253
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
I don't know

254
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Edgewild

255
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Skeleton

256
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Still be in jail after he dies like hanging like in Amityville

257
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
Original stamart skeletons hanging

258
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
It's f****** hilarious days Alex

259
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Oh you son of a b****

260
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
I'm coming

261
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
I'm coming to Spokane

262
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
And now he's like

263
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
I might not even go exist

264
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
47

265
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
Furlough

266
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
So I love that cuz

267
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
F****** coward when it really comes out

268
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
I wonder is there anything

269
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
More important now than death threats

270
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Yeah it's still scary but yeah

271
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Like if I say I didn't like the first episode of leftovers

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Mima that it's okay

273
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Listen up

274
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
You are making a death threat online

275
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
F****** at least go

276
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Hold on

277
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
I don't agree with that at all I don't agree with you I don't like that your problem with

278
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,815
Death threats online is with their Idol

279
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
College

280
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Columnist

281
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
University

282
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Missouri

283
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Actually inflammatory

284
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Italy student newspaper

285
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
And I would get that threats a bit

286
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Universal response was

287
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
F*** you

288
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
Nothing ever

289
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Enough policy wonk

290
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Get out of

291
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
I can't imagine

292
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
How many deaths

293
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Call Zach Alex Jones finds out about us

294
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
I think he might have already but

295
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
Dynamite I'm not saying that

296
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
And some sort of like

297
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,151
Conceited narcissistic way I just think he's Teddy enough to have a Google alert

298
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
I would not be surprised

299
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Some internet whatever is aware of

300
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
What we're doing

301
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
But the second that like his audience really become

302
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Globalist

303
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Connected

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
The Soros

305
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Roblox

306
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
Heart out so I

307
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Ton of evolution

308
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Position on Trump

309
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
But I did notice of this

310
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
This clip

311
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Indicating

312
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Assault

313
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
In his

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
And I know the arguments both ways very well but I'm very much into the Second Amendment

315
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
You also have entertainment and you have

316
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Out of the picture

317
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,191
Guns are used for recreational purposes

318
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:17,503
You know if you're sitting in that cabin someplace and you're not armed and somebody walks in with a gun

319
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
I'll tell you what I'd rather be in that cabin with a gun than not with a gun that out

320
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
He likes them a lot more cuz he started talking about.

321
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Call Manny gloves

322
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,055
No actual evolution

323
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Service position

324
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
It's just everything

325
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
He loves

326
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
For once

327
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
Restrain

328
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Giants

329
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
A really good class

330
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,719
Jumps off every caller give some information about

331
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Conspiracy

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
That's true I've been trying level sources

333
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
That ends up being the worst decision you've ever made

334
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
I really got a mole this one over for a couple

335
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
I think I actually I think I do know the answer to that question

336
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Like does he know.

337
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Does Alex

338
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Chilenos

339
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Like has he actually been told some

340
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Something that makes

341
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,927
I think it might be a piece of that

342
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Says different mob ties he's it

343
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
It's a Hatfield and McCoy situation

344
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
I think there may be a negotiation

345
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Been going on behind

346
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
I think

347
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
This publicly being like I like him but I don't trust

348
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
Is his way of publicly being like

349
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Sending a message

350
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,223
You need a bumper OfferUp

351
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,855
I think I realized why Alex was being a coward about the Paris

352
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
It's because he hadn't taken his super mail yet

353
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
Him taking a super male Vitality for the day

354
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
So he was a little cock

355
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
Little estrogen field

356
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
To take his medication

357
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
Amazon air and it's super fun cup

358
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
DeSoto

359
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Hair on the TV / radio show

360
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,527
Survival Shield

361
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Once a day

362
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
A little more

363
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,399
Out there and see how it works for you for years ago I started this

364
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Hindsight 20/20

365
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
Stronger

366
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
I have what I just put water

367
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Rock and roll

368
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
A secret

369
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,407
I can't reach it was somebody give me my methylcobalamin place to sorry

370
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,967
Running at the glass during the break

371
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
You know what

372
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
This is what I do at least once a day

373
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
Things get better around here

374
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
I really appreciate your help

375
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
I can't really

376
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
Someone ran off with that it's probably probably wandered off with it

377
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,215
Show me about Ramadan Mountain Water but

378
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
The old stomach

379
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
Write down the old jelly

380
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
With major keys

381
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
From the first time you drink whiskey

382
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,863
Tastes like Mama's milk but

383
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
I drink this

384
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,775

385
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:30,431
Yeah he needs to be careful about his Clockwork Orange reference

386
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,271
I don't think he understands why

387
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,879
This is the voice of a generation

388
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183

As opposed to whatever

396
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
He argues that

397
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
B vitamin B12 can be derived from like

398
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
Cyanide or something else

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
And there's is from something else

What are the big missions that Alex is on

410
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
During this

411
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663

He needs for that guy to be on meds

420
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,279
He needs to learn to be on cycle psychiatric medication

421
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Because he's

422
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Said that

423
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
He's already set

Call

425
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287

That's a real issue

430
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
It's all about Mental Health

431
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Now admittedly

432
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Mental health program

433
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928

Resident but

437
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Mental Health

Play Alex's position is

439
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
At least

440
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
A third of what mental health

441
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728

To talk a little bit about her

455
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Maybe

456
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Shooting was fake

457
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Uses a very weird maybe it was

458
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896

Go to Virginia

460
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,272
On the highway

461
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Apparently across

462
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,136
The street from like the center where the shooting happened

463
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
It's talk it's a bad shot

464
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Have no news

465
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
They have nothing

466
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Alex is talking about

467
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Maybe it's fake

468
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,704
First-person shooter shooting

469
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,592
That's cuter three times it looks like and she wants

470
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
They don't believe that they think it's fake

471
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Aurora shooting estate

472
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,720
Wild boar I shot Elgato

473
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
Sometimes you shoot

474
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,608
What's 7 mil mag

475
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Is blown in half

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
It looks like a first-person shooter map

477
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
Houses Beyond

478
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
We saw the night before

479
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,688
He's robbing the bank

480
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Nope

481
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
But

482
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
Watching that video while you're talking

483
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,256
Play that again

484
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
He does he plays it again

485
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
I can't f***

486
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Frozen bed

487
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
No

488
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,008
I'm not ready to say that this looks

489
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
The responses good

490
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
But the true comedy

491
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Hesitate even to call accommodate

492
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
No it's such dark

493
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,832
But

494
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
2 days

495
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Later on in this episode

496
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
There's a story about someone

497
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
A video of it

498
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
The playback

499
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
So he's willing to play all these

500
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
Propaganda Center for Medical progress videos

501
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
He's willing to

502
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Repeatedly play this

503
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Shooting

504
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Video

505
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Being sad

506
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Frankie wants to kill some

507
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
I think so too big Alex

508
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,456
Is living vicariously through this video

509
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
As like a

510
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
I have always wanted

511
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
To do this kind

512
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
PCS it as helping

513
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
His goals which is causing strife

514
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Fear and strife

515
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
This never would have happened

516
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Protect

517
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
That argument is made

518
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Of course it is

519
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
King Corso

520
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,800
Yeah if this person was doing their job doing a remote

521
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,848
For a local news just had a gun

522
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
They could have

523
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Not Ben

524
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Surprise

525
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Yeah what

526
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Anyway

527
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
I just

528
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Wish they would understand

529
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
That I don't

530
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Tear what

531
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Solve the gunfire

532
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
As long as it's

533
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
If that means everybody gets

534
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Cigun

535
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Fine

536
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Give everybody done

537
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Prefer if it was socialized

538
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
Play the government administers

539
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
You know

540
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Gives everybody

541
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,688
You got your Obama gun

542
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
It's just how can you not see houses

543
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
He's giving a remote

544
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
If you think

545
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,304
This lady is going to be doing her work

546
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
And then

547
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Jesus guy and pulls out a gun on

548
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Another

549
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,544
How much more Wild

550
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
I'm not sure I would now good God no

551
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
Next clip of Alex Jones talking about homeless people

552
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,464
Immigration

553
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Messiah

554
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
And seen homeless Guatemalans catching fish

555
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,520
With a piece of monofilament

556
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
They're really sweet nice people

557
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,968
What is the government doing here everywhere else just opening everything up

558
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
It was

559
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
With a fire going over across the creek

560
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay fine

561
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
These are countries Grizzly Adams where the 21st century

562
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
What's the reason

563
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:43,232
Because when it all unravels and melts down you know what storm

564
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,816
And they're mixing radical jihadist into this

565
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
Because the public doesn't have logic anymore

566
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
The public doesn't have logic anymore

567
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,968
We're going to bring a Guatemalan Grizzly Adams

568
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,928
That what don't you get the f****** public

569
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
If you don't have a lot of

570
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Their industry

571
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
People they figured out how to

572
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,960
Great

573
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm a little jealous of their lifestyle

574
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,616
Living at living out in the Woods fishing

575
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
I don't like to eat

576
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Fish.

577
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
Define like a I don't know a mule

578
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,760
To kill everyone

579
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Domino

580
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624

African-American homeless people fishing

587
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
It's not

588
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,984
Some sort of weird immigrant thing

589
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
A lot of homeless people find food spam

590
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
How we treat our people

591
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968

Innocence

644
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
But his insanity

645
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Not

646
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
I mean

647
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
Racially problematic beliefs

648
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
He also believes it like

649
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
We can encounter anybody

650
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312

651
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,664

657
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
The last time we talked about it

658
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Because Alex Jones was talking about how he

659
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
He's basically a prophet

660
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
And all this predict

661
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Come true

662
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240

663
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288

And that's being pretty

770
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Text I've been Skype

771
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,584
Just cuz I don't know one thing about this

772
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
Who cares

773
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,472
We're practicing the argument that we may have with

774
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,176
Well you didn't know about Unit 731

775
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
You don't know about Giants

776
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,160
How I'll handle that argument

777
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
Here's what I'll do

778
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
I'm going to punt on units

779
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
731

780
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Can have it

781
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
Let's talk about more important issues

782
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
Like the Linguistics of angels

783
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
What do you think

784
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,568
What

785
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
In South America

786
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Is going to discover

787
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
At the very least

788
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Look for

789
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
The language of fall

790
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
I don't know man

791
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
It's wild stuff

792
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Hey but it's you know

793
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
It's like

794
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
It's this idea I think that

795
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
I'd attend Lovecraft

796
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,560
Throughout like this idea of people getting in over their heads

797
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Like a lot of the protagonist

798
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
The Lovecraft stories are like

799
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Antiquarians is like

800
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
Just a researchers are professors

801
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,544
Cuz everybody is basically molded on Lovecraft

802
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,360
Himself interested in

803
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
Old-timey stuff

804
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
And maybe you'd like to read and write

805
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,016
I accidentally mixed up with Kong

806
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
Or

807
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
Yog-sothoth off

808
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Because the only

809
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Santa's looking

810
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
And so I think that that's

811
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Kind of

812
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,816
Spiritually I don't think he's ripping off of crap but I think that's

813
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
This mathematician was

814
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
I don't know notice a notoriously field

815
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,152
Got to go out there in the field and find new numbers

816
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
So look

817
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
Unit 731 might've done some villainous ship

818
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
But there's a

819
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
In the world

820
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
Taking into consideration

821
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
Supernatural

822
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
On that whole statement obviously The Illuminati's going to say we were seeded by aliens

823
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
The Vatican is getting ready to baptize aliens

824
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
That's not what

825
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Why does the Vatican

826
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Get ready

827
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Tobacco

828
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,552
Do they are they

829
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Different equipment

830
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
I remember hearing something about that

831
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,720
Just like a hypothetical conversation that it was like

832
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,560
Like if we do eventually meet Aliens

833
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,168
Do we would be open to that

834
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Terrible

835
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,264
The first thing that they think of with aliens

836
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,336
How do we make them cats Larry save their souls

837
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
What you got

838
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,736
Well I differ from all those guys is this

839
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Easy for them to

840
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,184
The Anunnaki name them whatever the gods I've actually dependa gonz calls I think

841
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Sumerian gods all those things are fallen angels masquerading as something

842
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,616
You know somebody from the planet and terrorists in order to deceive in order

843
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,248
Perpetrated

844
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
Populated the planet and even all the mesoamericans recorded Native Americans work

845
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
Court

846
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,448
Play the bones why do they hide all the

847
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,919
Reuters I'm not painting yet but I will obviously be coming soon sometime

848
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
It's the greatest Snowman

849
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Who created the alien

850
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
We're seeing the pope show up on the 23rd

851
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:15,935
September has done an amazing job of you know basically

852
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Writing out at the vatican's on

853
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Idea can you have an alien save

854
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
Cancel that is no

855
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
Because Jesus didn't die for the angels that since he died for mankind Jesus

856
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
Around

857
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:49,215
Book of Revelation

858
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Come down

859
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,543
Knowing he has but a short time

860
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,919
People can't separate the wrath of God which is at the end of the tribulation

861
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
What about the

862
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
Eminem

863
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,239
Music by here

864
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Oh man

865
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
I love I love how

866
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
If they're so close

867
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
These people are so stupid but they're so close like

868
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,759
Aliens created people will who created

869
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,343
Well who created

870
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,463
The laws first met

871
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,023
It's Turtles all the way down my friend

872
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,191
You know just like Larry Nichols made that logical

873
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
Slip up at the beginning of the episode

874
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Steve mehdi identical

875
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
In terms of not recognizing what is words in

876
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Imply

877
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Just crazy

878
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
Basically ripping off

879
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Snow crash

880
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
You know what else

881
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Express

882
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Zacharias

883
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Pitchin Road about

884
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
Okay I don't know

885
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
They want I'll deal with Zack

886
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Do you know him well enough

887
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,007
The Columns Akai do a couple of his books

888
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,567
All right along with Erich von daniken

889
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Are the two guys

890
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
Could say are the most responsible for the ancient alien

891
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Phenomenon

892
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,039
Okay if the TV show a very based on a lot of his research

893
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
I believe Giorgio Tsoukalos

894
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,439
The guy with the crazy hair on that show

895
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Zecharia sitchin

896
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,047
He wrote the book called The Tenth Planet

897
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
Is a series of seven books

898
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
I read the first two disciples

899
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Garbage

900
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,495
I basically just missed translates a bunch of old Sumerian texts

901
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Do

902
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,591
Make the argument that oil and Anki

903
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
R2 alien gods

904
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
That existed on our planet

905
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
They created Humanity as a

906
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
The slave race in order to mine gold for them

907
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
Adara salon

908
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Is gold or something like that

909
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
In order to fix

910
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
The environment of their planet

911
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Something along those lines

912
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Anyway

913
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,071
They come back periodically because

914
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
There on planet

915
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Or as

916
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,471
People call that Naboo right that has a elliptical orbit

917
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
That's why we got X-Men

918
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,639
Elliptical orbit goes around much longer scale

919
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,199
We are aware of

920
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
That way

921
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
We've had telescopes

922
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Outside of our range

923
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
It's has been

924
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,903
It's been too far.

925
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
There's a good possibility

926
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Ability there is a

927
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
It's not that

928
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
I'm pretty sure

929
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,151
The argument was actually on

930
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
2012

931
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
One of the big

932
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Over

933
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Flying fish

934
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
That that was when Planet X

935
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
Was going to come back

936
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Sumerian gods

937
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:29,375
Which had become since the last time they won

938
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,983
I mean

939
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
Translate

940
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,663
Erich von daniken

941
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
Zecharia sitchin

942
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
The scholars are not they're not

943
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Accurate there

944
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,343
They are not even accurate in their name

945
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Those are not real

946
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
I like

947
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
I like him too but that

948
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,863
Doesn't get more made of maggots

949
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Come on man

950
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
He's making

951
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
Do that stuff

952
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
You know all of the

953
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
All the ancient alien theories had tons

954
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
Giants

955
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
And stuff like that

956
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
And so like

957
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,855
Alex is allowing a guy who'd believe this stuff based on

958
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,415
Wild interpretation of the Bible

959
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
To be on his show and his

960
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,999
Response to everything

961
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
It's so it's so cowardly

962
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
Even

963
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,847
Even fallen angels

964
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,407
But I didn't know there were any actual

965
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Fallen one

966
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,991
I believe

967
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,671
Look up know everything about the Bible but as I work all day

968
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Search about angels

969
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:04,351
They're not supposed to f*** ladies and they came down and they sucked lady

970
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Outlook

971
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Fallen angels in the Bible

972
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,727
I don't believe there are

973
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Who cares

974
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,567
Good point very good point

975
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
I think that I'm being honest

976
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Unfair about

977
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Steve Quayle

978
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,855
We could be being unfair to about believes in flight

979
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
I thank you gentlemen

980
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,583
I am a question to Steve is prompted by your discussion he had to

981
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
George Noory

982
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Earlier this year

983
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Panda Express

984
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Steve

985
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
Are you still

986
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Expecting some sort of

987
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,591
Planet X appearance event

988
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
Early next year

989
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
Well I actually did

990
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
I think we're

991
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Senior

992
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,111
We're experiencing the gravitational

993
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
The climatic in the volcano City on there's all kinds of

994
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:06,047
Strikers and gravitational pressures and other pressures

995
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,607
Being placed on there so yeah I think you're seeing it

996
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Alright

997
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
Planet X is already

998
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Gravitational pressure volcano

999
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Ain't good

1000
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:28,063
No brains

1001
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Cockroaches

1002
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
You do not have a good source

1003
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
So probably not

1004
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
I think this might be time

1005
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Time for that narrative

1006
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Creepypasta

1007
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
Possible who would you believe

1008
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,911
If they were telling me that they were actually like what

1009
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,983
What level of credulity do you have to have

1010
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
Like if Stephen Hawking

1011
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
Do you know what

1012
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
When I was working with the government

1013
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,711
We put a

1014
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
I would say

1015
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
My man

1016
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
I don't believe you

1017
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
I think that

1018
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
Until someone

1019
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Where to

1020
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,159
Fully layout

1021
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
How's that work

1022
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,743
Write the point

1023
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,095
That I'm a hangout with cockroach

1024
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
I don't think I'm going to

1025
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,983
If you have cockroaches

1026
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
And Noah

1027
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,663
I got nothing in common with a cockroach have nothing in common with a baby

1028
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
Middle-aged cockroach

1029
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,319
Sure

1030
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,391
I'm in hangout with that guy

1031
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Kind of tragic

1032
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Cuz the Cockroaches

1033
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
They're homeless real

1034
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
Yeah there are there fish

1035
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,607
Cockroaches

1036
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,447
These Guatemalans have teamed up with these cockroaches in power

1037
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,287
Calvary August

1038
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
27

1039
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
August 28th

1040
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
And all this episode we got

1041
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
The most weird stuff

1042
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
Little bit of weirdness

1043
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
The very bad admission

1044
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
I will get to in a second

1045
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
Begin

1046
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Start

1047
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
Making a pretty

1048
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Uncharacteristic

1049
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Praise

1050
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Kind of statement

1051
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
4

1052
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
A former world leader

1053
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,799
And yes it's true the globalist went into every country to try to stabilize you just say what you want about South Africa under apartheid

1054
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
What is socialism

1055
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,759
Asthma

1056
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,831
Almost all of the countries money

1057
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
College

1058
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:44,255
Real jobs highways aquifers jet aircraft jobs

1059
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
It's gone

1060
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
Because he was a cocky peacock

1061
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,639
Overall compared to wanted to build up Africa

1062
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
Old-fashioned prosperity

1063
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,039
There it is socialism don't work is a philosopher

1064
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
Resources

1065
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,415
Old days gold

1066
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
Oil and water

1067
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Aquaphor

1068
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:24,191
You just given that oil

1069
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,007
You know why Alex supports

1070
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Because he was trying

1071
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
To implement

1072
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,431
What currency was trying to get off the

1073
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
The petrodollar

1074
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Kill them

1075
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
And also like

1076
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Of course he hates

1077
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
The central bank

1078
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,927
Wreck

1079
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
All of qaddafi's like

1080
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,047
Gassing is people s*** like that

1081
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Does believe in

1082
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
It's very scary to me records

1083
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:05,663
Just go back to your Google Hangout

1084
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
Deal with the United States military

1085
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,367
Super weird but it does illustrate what is priorities

1086
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,951
Games are for him

1087
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Prosperity

1088
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Trouble at all.

1089
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,375
Next clip

1090
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
A little bit

1091
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Discussion of trump

1092
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,055
Episode Alex Jones I think it started

1093
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
To show some crack

1094
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Grandpa

1095
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
Starting to resent

1096
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
And Paul not listening

1097
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
Two months now he's been on the air

1098
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
I like

1099
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
You're the best

1100
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
But you need

1101
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
To start being a dick

1102
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,231
You need to start being at like attacking

1103
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Attacking Hillary you need to do the

1104
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Much harder

1105
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
On immigration

1106
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,935
To be embarrassing in public because

1107
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,799
Yeah

1108
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
You're not getting on board

1109
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:11,199
Right starting to have that

1110
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:15,039
Nimaway from Rand Paul is his own Petty resentment

1111
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
And I

1112
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Chimeras

1113
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:28,863
I want to illustrate what's happening with the collapsing borders and where

1114
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
Your phone calls

1115
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
Forget to go there

1116
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,735
Criticize rampaul

1117
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,551
Tried to be friendly about it

1118
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,511
I can't find a

1119
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
I want to believe

1120
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,631
He's got a checkered past and so

1121
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,471
You got to really have some reservations

1122
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
I mean we can see it

1123
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
Starting I feel like

1124
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Starting to drift

1125
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Rand Paul butt

1126
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
The same time every time he says

1127
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
He does not trust

1128
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Trump still

1129
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
So there we are

1130
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
How many weeks are we on with

1131
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,927
Like he's constantly ever

1132
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Talking about Trump

1133
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Like nobody at this point of course no but

1134
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
We could stop talking

1135
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
One of the big problem

1136
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
We got billions of dollars in free

1137
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
Like how

1138
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543

00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:57,439
Title of house

1144
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,743

00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,407
So I've I've done a little bit of looking at

1151
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Peter Schiff

1152
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,807
You've lost a lot of people a ton of money

1153
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,135
I'm not in it for the short game

1154
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Yeah sure

1155
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
We're down right now

1156
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,375
Especially when you're the son of someone who

1157
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Didn't pay taxes

1158
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,471
On billions of dollars

1159
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,567
Got a lot of people because of it

1160
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,919
Stepped on and also indicate

1161
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Weird

1162
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
Allegiances in terms of who he's pulling for in the 20s

1163
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:58,623
16 election

1164
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:06,047
Liquor has less baggage

1165
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,887
Gets to the blue-collar workers and people

1166
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
But

1167
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,447
Hillary is a woman

1168
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:18,591
And really is a trump card

1169
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:24,223
Carly fiorina she's been on your show

1170
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,183
What is I mean if you had her against Hillary I mean

1171
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,743
You take away the woman advantage

1172
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:41,375
And now you know it's going to be a woman president a matter who you vote for

1173
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
And I think

1174
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,263
Arena

1175
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
Yeah I think Carly

1176
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,831
Productive

1177
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,743
If everything is just based on capitalism

1178
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Fremont

1179
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:14,399
Is essentially endorse half the field

1180
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,983
Carly fiorina fall

1181
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,287
Hunza people he saying like

1182
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Everybody but Jeb Bush

1183
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
Yeah

1184
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,175
F*** you to Jeb Bush

1185
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,735
This weird

1186
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
Rockies game

1187
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,575
What's going on doing that to any of these other candidates

1188
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
That's true

1189
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:39,231
Behaving very weird lie down on one side of the other with every everybody

1190
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,279
I hate you

1191
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,119
No it's super f***** up

1192
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,471
Chris Christie is a fat piece of s***

1193
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,311
The globalists whatevs

1194
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,639
0 reservations in fully endorsing

1195
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
Too much further like

1196
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,879
I hate feelings about the candidate

1197
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,183
Who's next

1198
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
He doesn't have any responsibility for this

1199
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Situations that happened

1200
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
In the third world

1201
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Then

1202
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
He takes it but

1203
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
Opposition

1204
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:25,823
So we can stop there

1205
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
And it leads to another position

1206
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
Each of them are not great

1207
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,247
But together they're very bad

1208
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
So here we go enjoy this

1209
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,391
Is delightful control

1210
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,439
Just want to risk everything

1211
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,447
Police themselves are

1212
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:59,359
Places to fight the policies

1213
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:03,199
Schizophrenic

1214
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,879
But I have no responsibility when somebody somebody in

1215
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,183
Nicaragua or somebody in

1216
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,607
Want to have seven kids

1217
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
Define culture

1218
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,479
Run-of-the-mill basic flavors

1219
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
I don't want you telling me what to do

1220
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Because

1221
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Average

1222
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
It's

1223
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
Gorgeous

1224
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Click

1225
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
Alex wants to f***

1226
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,247
What is

1227
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:47,647
What's on power rack

1228
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
Thinking of racism

1229
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
Not sure if it's

1230
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
What is that Eve

1231
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
I don't know

1232
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,911
Women

1233
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
Now they're only amazing

1234
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
There's there's no whistles what is happening

1235
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,639
What I don't know what that's doing on his ship

1236
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
YouTube

1237
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,087
I think it's his internalization he's project morning

1238
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Like

1239
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,159
What color of women

1240
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
Now we know

1241
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:26,047
Now we know

1242
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Close it up

1243
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,887
Some of the issues that we should deal with

1244
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
If you were an actual show the guide

1245
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Bring up in

1246
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
I wanted

1247
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
Interesting and important

1248
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
A lot of the

1249
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
Stabilisation in third world

1250
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Population

1251
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,343
Has benefited greatly in a civilization

1252
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Sort of

1253
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,951
Often has exploited and

1254
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:59,327
You could say that you have some responsibility

1255
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,423
Population

1256
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
You're super again

1257
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
Contraception

1258
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
You're super again

1259
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,359
Those sort of educational reproductive education

1260
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,919
Whether it be in this country or other country

1261
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,247
So what are you shut the fuk up people in third world countries having seven kids

1262
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,599
Wonder if they have access to healthcare maybe it wouldn't be

1263
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,951
Alex

1264
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Stop f******

1265
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,791
That's one word

1266
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,167
Like who he's attracted to is

1267
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Such

1268
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Zane guilt

1269
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
Like it is

1270
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
She always does

1271
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Whatever he seems like

1272
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
So you're saying that

1273
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,599
I don't think it's racist necessarily to be attracted to someone of your own race

1274
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
I think it's races

1275
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Has to be exclusively attracted

1276
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
People of any race

1277
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,839
Like when you finish I there's a lot of people fetishize like Asian women

1278
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
I think there's a lot of people

1279
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
Lenny population

1280
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,543
And I think that's wrong cuz you're treating somebody as a thing as opposed to a person

1281
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,335
Yeah I don't see that

1282
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
I don't think that that

1283
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
At the same time

1284
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
Recognizing

1285
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,711
Often

1286
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
Statistically

1287
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,855
Someone is one of race ends up dating someone also erase a

1288
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
That's not racist

1289
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,207
Do Alex Jones being like primarily

1290
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
Just Proxima

1291
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
Yeah

1292
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,655
Chicago is just around the same

1293
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,751
And it's cultural to

1294
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
That's absurd

1295
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
The things that

1296
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,919
I refuse to answer that question.

1297
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,247
Whatever

1298
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
Is very

1299
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Especially the wolf whistle

1300
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Insanely

1301
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
It's it's pudding

1302
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Himself in the position

1303
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,143
Like all that matters is he's at

1304
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,447
Doesn't matter of anybody else's

1305
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
Distracted

1306
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,615
He's the one who he's the one who does the is the Arbiter of value

1307
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
Using outright misogyny in order to dodge racism

1308
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Very strange

1309
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
I'm so fascinated by these things that he embodies

1310
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
It doesn't even realize

1311
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Like you do

1312
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Never gave a second

1313
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Thought to that

1314
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
No

1315
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,375
That was

1316
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,423
Fuct

1317
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,799
Play my prey

1318
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
SMS

1319
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
Like he seems

1320
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
To be a

1321
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Product

1322
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,831
The product of his environment but the distillation of his

1323
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Sure

1324
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,183
Is absorbed by

1325
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
A lot of people

1326
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,023
Where he grew up

1327
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
Texas is

1328
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
AR

1329
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Most

1330
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
You name it

1331
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,007
Is Olive

1332
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,055
These things that are ingrained in

1333
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Do you just pee

1334
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Purely by

1335
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
Is osmosis

1336
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,455
He doesn't even necessarily need to

1337
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
Oh this is how you

1338
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Women because

1339
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
It's just

1340
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
They are

1341
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,903
Bizarre ideas about chivalry

1342
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
Infantilized

1343
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
And because of his

1344
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,535
Shutter lag

1345
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Self-awareness

1346
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
To him

1347
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
Is that your child

1348
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
His

1349
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,959
Every

1350
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,311
Anyway let's move on to this next clip

1351
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Alex Jones

1352
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Explain

1353
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,919
One of the negative outcomes of immigration

1354
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
Babies Rock

1355
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
North African town

1356
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
Thousand people in 2000

1357
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
They would not lovingly take care of them

1358
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
Images

1359
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,447
I come in your house

1360
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,823
Eraser erasers I mean certain point

1361
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,615
That will make people go

1362
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Yikes

1363
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,967
That'll make people go Hitler Hitler

1364
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
That was actually

1365
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,439
It was it was between Breaking Bad and go Hitler

1366
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
You do you know the the

1367
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,535
The presumption in that

1368
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
Sentence is that Hillary

1369
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Just had

1370
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,447
Schleich I've had enough

1371
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
That's what made him break

1372
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,799
That was as opposed to

1373
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
Just being hateful from the jump

1374
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,991
Scapegoating

1375
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Beat

1376
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,295
The constant

1377
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,343
Rewriting of Hitler's motivation

1378
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,159
To just justify whatever it is

1379
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
If you want to say

1380
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
Is banana

1381
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,303
Especially when

1382
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
He may

1383
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,679
Entirely believe with someone who believes that Nazis still have under-eye spaces

1384
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
At the polar caps

1385
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Well if you go to any North Africa

1386
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
You might wander upon Hitler

1387
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,383
That's how we got there

1388
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,855
Also I told you earlier than Alex Jones on this August 28th episode makes a startling admission

1389
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,903
And here it is

1390
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
I think this

1391
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,719
Is deeply problematic

1392
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,279
And Alex might not even recognize what do you think

1393
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,191
Transgendered lives matter

1394
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
Who won the Democrats

1395
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,743
Sticker 6 months ago

1396
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,399
I don't care I just want to

1397
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,799
I want have a limited run of Hillary Clinton for prison t-shirts

1398
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Okay

1399
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,151
Hillary for prison

1400
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,711
Yeah he stole intellectual property from someone else

1401
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Another one

1402
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
Profit off of it

1403
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:47,647
Limited run

1404
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,951
It's one of those things

1405
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,767
He's just getting the word he's sold is made

1406
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
So much money on those shirt

1407
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
It's absurd that is

1408
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
Would like that might be the admission of a crime

1409
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
I don't know who owns

1410
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,727
I don't know who made those bumper stickers

1411
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:08,127
But it is bumper sticker

1412
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,455
Email us I'll send you this clip please do Alex Jones

1413
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
Also the other day

1414
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
From prison

1415
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:22,463
They're talking about the private prison

1416
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
Blurred Hillary

1417
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,119
I'm not a hundred percent sure but I've listened to his number of times I believe in what they're saying

1418
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,143
Is Hillary divest

1419
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
From prison

1420
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,727
She has

1421
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
Taking money from the private private

1422
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Prison industry

1423
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,359
Super f***** up I believe

1424
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Kanzashi you slave

1425
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,455
Problematic

1426
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,039
I think that Alex Jones

1427
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,367
He's being a little bit fast and loose with this trying to

1428
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
Pretend that these

1429
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
American Transit

1430
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,999
Youth are on the same

1431
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,327
The reality

1432
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Celery

1433
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,375
Stop

1434
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,191
Incarcerating

1435
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,215
Alex Jones

1436
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
Do you want to talk about that issue all that much

1437
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
Oh yeah

1438
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
I don't know I don't hear it I don't hear it come up much

1439
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
What's August 30th

1440
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
You're done with the 28th that was a Friday

1441
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,807
On Saturday when I come back Sunday

1442
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Even god Ra

1443
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Sundays

1444
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,743
Balloons

1445
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,815
Is going to be pushing

1446
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,375
The race war has already

1447
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,935
It's already

1448
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,495
Dip

1449
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
What is a race

1450
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Swarm

1451
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,767
That music is really loud

1452
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,095
Yeah music

1453
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,055
Even within his like

1454
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,103
These dumb white and black

1455
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Alright

1456
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
Congratulations

1457
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,831
You should really

1458
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,391
Turn the music up more

1459
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
Race war is a

1460
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Camp of

1461
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
Brainwashed

1462
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Yes

1463
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
Start at the beginning

1464
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:44,543
The Triumph he wants white start killing black

1465
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
Blackstar killing whites

1466
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:49,919
Media doesn't report on the fact that black people are killing white people

1467
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
I don't know

1468
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,527
So that it's not black people and white people lining up

1469
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Have to kill each other

1470
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
Black people

1471
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,671
As his brothers

1472
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Yeah

1473
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,559
So I mentioned earlier Alex Jones

1474
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Endorses someone

1475
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,655
For president who's not running

1476
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
You just doesn't

1477
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
Infer why

1478
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,055
There is a fully justifiable resentment

1479
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,223
It's not brainwashing it's like I'm totally on board

1480
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
Murdering sits on the white people is like guys

1481
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,319
Come on it's time

1482
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,111
Come on do it

01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,439
It's a remarkable

1484
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,743
Restraint a very admirable

1485
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Quite frankly

1486
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
But

1487
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
Just say he's already said

1488
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Someone else

Online

1499
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:39,231
I've seen the speeches and he just really

1500
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,191
You know what he also has got he's got dead people in a

1501
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Is jails

1502
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,775
Yeah

1503
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,895
I'm not using cards or a teleprompter

1504
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,623
It is so important

1505
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
4

1506
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
Alex Jones

1507
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,695
People on the right

1508
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
It's a propaganda point.

1509
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
They get to make

1510
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
We don't use teleprompters

1511
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
We're just real

1512
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,399
Yeah there's there's a feigned authenticity in that

1513
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
That they used

1514
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,007
To attack people who have scripted speeches as like I know you're fake

1515
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
You idiot Spence

1516
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,847
Time thinking about what you want to say

1517
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
What is wrong with you

1518
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,271
I'm being real

1519
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,063
Dumbshit pops out of your mouth

1520
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,623
Absolutely works

1521
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Stand up

1522
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,487
Also these people who you think aren't

1523
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,511
Scripting things

1524
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
Are just people who are good at making

1525
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
It seem like they're not

1526
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
They're not giving

1527
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,911
Off-the-cuff speeches

1528
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:57,567
In the same way that a good stand-up comedian it seems like they're saying something for the first time

1529
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,431
And that is the illusion

1530
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,967
Right

1531
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
These people I'm sure

1532
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Speeches the chair Park is given

1533
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,343
I'm sure they're the same thing

1534
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
Even even in here

1535
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
Crazy

1536
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
For Sheriff Clarke

1537
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
Dads

1538
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
White coat

1539
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,839
What year was always been used to imply that

1540
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
That that that

1541
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,631
Prizing thing

1542
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
For a black pearl

1543
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:26,239
Bigotry of diminished expectations

1544
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
Very guilty

1545
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
I've often

1546
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
Talked about

1547
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,175
How I believe that Alex Jones

1548
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,711
Super into white identity

1549
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Stop

1550
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Maybe

1551
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,063
Shuffle on white nationalist

1552
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Did not realize

1553
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
Right

1554
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,927
Two clips are going to justify my position a little bit

1555
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:49,023
Call prisonculture

1556
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,631
Culture is fusion with a bunch of Misfits

1557
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,783
Sheriff Clarke and then I'm going to walk through all this

1558
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,703
Going on in Austin

1559
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:35,103
That's another example

1560
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Look up real loud

1561
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
Local government doesn't want

1562
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
Yeah I just

1563
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,343
I don't want to say I love it

1564
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Because I don't

1565
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,415
But the. Just a quote

1566
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,999
I have tons of videos of black people beating up white people

1567
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:56,351
What else

1568
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Come on

1569
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:03,775
Like

1570
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:09,663
Beating up a white lady outside like a 7-Eleven

1571
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
All of these things

1572
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
There's Justice

1573
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,279
Vacations but there's more going on than just

1574
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,303
Random Acts

1575
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
Violence

1576
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,375
Provide the knowledge fight position with

1577
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
Which is toxic

1578
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
Crap I don't know

1579
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
I don't know

1580
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
If you want to get

1581
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
Scared and scare your audience

1582
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
Based on

1583
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:42,431
Weird video game stuff all over again

1584
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,247
It's a good game to play

1585
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,783
You scare people you can make money

1586
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,087
But at the same time what you're doing is in

1587
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Incredible Disturbed

1588
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,159
Sprite you're just making white people

1589
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Scared of life

1590
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,719
If you don't have it

1591
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,023
Amplified

1592
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Racist form of what

1593
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,839
Local news is done

1594
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:03,679
Forever

1595
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
Rainbow party

1596
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
Stuff is just that

1597
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,359
That's cool

1598
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,407
That's just cool school

1599
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,503
This stuff is like it really is a preemptive Justice

1600
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
Application for when white people

1601
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Who killed black people

1602
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,391
So he can justify

1603
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,695
Yeah

1604
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,743
It's really it's really bad

1605
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
We've been oppressed by black

1606
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,071
People for too long

1607
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:37,983
I mean that PC argument is sort of along the same line by these minority groups that are legitimately

1608
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,359
Jesus Christ really the thought process

1609
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:47,711
Because what they're doing is they're trying to change speech

1610
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
To change the way we do

1611
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,831
Define things at that point they'll be able to get our guns

1612
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
That's basically

1613
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
It's it's caca

1614
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,511
So I feel like I've been like a little unfair

1615
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,071
As hard on myself

1616
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
As possible in terms of

1617
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Not making

1618
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
10 claims about Alex

1619
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
I can't really back up

1620
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
Really afraid of white Jenna

1621
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,824
He's into those narratives

1622
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Was a little bit like

1623
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
It's not really fair to me I didn't really talk about that

1624
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,248
He uses some of the similar terms

1625
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,088
But here I was wrong

1626
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
To judge myself

1627
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,952
Over more of what's Happening where

1628
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,048
The Country Inn

1629
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,472
White people

1630
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,312
The fairgrounds

1631
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,504
Black females

1632
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,576
Will just come up and beat them in their life

1633
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
Neighborhood

1634
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,536
You're white

1635
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
Eminem TV show

1636
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,144
A report coming up

1637
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,704
It's impossible

1638
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,792
People vary within groups

1639
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
About average

1640
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,960
It is so wild country girl

1641
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,968
I can't even say the n word

1642
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
Just it inherently exist

1643
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
This is

1644
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
A push and a move

1645
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,672
To genocide

1646
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,280
Any type of white Western culture

1647
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
Type of white

1648
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Speed later

1649
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
Because the globalist want to kill everybody

1650
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,360
But it seems to be

1651
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
Incredibly past

1652
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
About the first part

1653
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Nothing

1654
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
People are this

1655
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,904
It's some sort of weird kind of Jedi Mind

1656
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
That he's pulling off for his list

1657
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
It's like listen people are all the same

1658
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,584
Black people are beating up white

1659
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:50,240
All the time all over the place

1660
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:56,640
Black males and black females are attacking women alone

1661
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,624
Even uses chillary in terms of nights

1662
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,976
Women never really know what he's talking about

1663
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,024
Yeah it's it is

1664
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,840
And

1665
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:20,960
You know what a weirdo because he uses that you shouldn't be in the

1666
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
Neighborhood

1667
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,800
Has been used

1668
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
Murder

1669
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,408
Yeah

1670
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,248
Other one

1671
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,320
The other way around

1672
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,856
Is one of the most

1673
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,232
Her if we don't like your kind around here is it historically White

1674
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,256
Fred's

1675
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:51,168
Actually I'm a little bit ashamed little while to formulate

1676
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,240
One of the things

1677
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,520
Things that this serves

1678
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,288
This sort of

1679
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,336
Alex Jones.

1680
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,896
All times

1681
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,432
Examples throughout

1682
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Speech

1683
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Feed into

1684
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
What are you talkin about

1685
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
You know Muslims

1686
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,160
Wanting to implement Sharia law

1687
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,464
Stupid and secretly Satanist

1688
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,512
Black people are beating up white

1689
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
People in droves

1690
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
What do you doing is he

1691
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
He's teaching his audience

1692
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
To be afraid of strangers

1693
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
He's teaching his audience to

1694
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
Further insulate them

1695
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
Themselves

1696
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,872
Because these black people that you see on the street you don't know who they are

1697
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,152
Just out of nowhere punch you

1698
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,968
Write these Muslims might be Taurus

1699
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,832
These other white people that use if you don't actually know them they might

1700
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
We're trying to

1701
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
Help the globalist

1702
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,304
Which is pretty much he's doing Charles Manson he's doing a ridiculous fear of string

1703
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,424
If you buy into him

1704
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,728
If you buy into what he's saying

1705
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
So much occult

1706
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
Absolutely

1707
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,616
Isolate isolate

1708
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,152
People and reinforce their beliefs

1709
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,224
And for the worst and not just that but

1710
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,272
You are somebody

1711
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
Because your isolate

1712
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
Surrounded by other

1713
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
I think

1714
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,976
Pressure on YouTube

1715
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
Get back in line

1716
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,304
What are you going globalist

1717
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,584
Play that

1718
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,120
That's how you kind of

1719
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
Get that caught lie

1720
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Mentality that group

1721
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
To really take over

1722
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Yeah

1723
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,312
Totally

1724
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,384
You like that narrative is the one that

1725
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,200
Is is the reason that they

1726
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,992
Constantly afraid of that race

1727
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,808
That push them closer and closer to me

1728
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,024
The only thing that's missing from Alex's I calling is

1729
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,888
Group family

1730
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,704
They are in an army that's what I like

1731
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
That's not

1732
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
The words

1733
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,616
So Jordan you know that I'm trying to figure out where Alex Jones

1734
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Narratives begin

1735
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
I've heard

1736
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
City sights

1737
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,248
And found that they did not say what

1738
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:17,856
Example on this episode

1739
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
The bit about Aldous Huxley

1740
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
Aldous Huxley

1741
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
Speech that he gave

1742
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
The 19th

1743
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
B2

1744
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,352
And I'll just let Alex speak his

1745
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,824
We're going to have a high-tech

1746
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,688
Pharmakeia where we drugged you and dumb you down

1747
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,992
An end sexual activity

1748
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
And make you asexual

1749
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,136
And then basically face humans out entirely and go to machines

1750
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,952
His brother

1751
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,000
Which actually runs the UN he was

1752
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,536
Director-general of UNESCO

1753
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
I don't care my brother runs

1754
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
Ice cream shop

1755
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
I'm not in big ice cream

1756
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,912
You know I don't know

1757
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
Anyway

1758
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:10,080
This is Alex Jones has been into

1759
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
Do for quite a while

1760
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,408
He made a documentary years back called

1761
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:17,248
Endgame

1762
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
From Huxley

1763
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
And all I owe him

1764
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,136
Let's just listen to this clip from Alex Jones documentary

1765
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
Shortly before his death

1766
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,984
British best selling book

1767
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,944
This entire documentary to I should

1768
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
Today is

1769
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Fascinating

1770
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,040
Because visually there's not much for him

1771
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:54,880
As though you just played weird images of like brain control

1772
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:00,000
Images of people being fingerprinted

1773
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:05,888
Associate things with things

1774
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,912
8

1775
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
Really

1776
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,264
Manipulative

1777
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
I am diarrhea

1778
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,368
Caterpillar Brave New World

1779
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,672
We said another catapult

1780
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
Respectful

1781
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:35,072
George Orwell's book 1984

1782
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
The

1783
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,960
Scientific

1784
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,128
Will be probably

1785
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
Eventually

1786
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,336
So there's a little bit more this time but I wanted to cut in here because Alex's

1787
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:54,432
Is cutting up the speech like crazy

1788
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,224
Very different parts

1789
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,296
It's a 45

1790
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,880
It's a 45-minute lecture that he gives

1791
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,488
Ultimate Revolution you can find it on YouTube

1792
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
The Charming order

1793
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,680
The thing that's important is Alex Jones's argument

1794
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,240
Aldous Huxley has admitted

1795
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,520
He is a part of the

1796
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
Is Henry

1797
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,592
On the use of the word we

1798
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
In that clip right there

1799
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,920
Developing

1800
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,016
It's like that from a different person

1801
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,320
He's clearly talking about there just being a

1802
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,880
Trend in humanity

1803
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,720
Universal we absolutely

1804
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:45,120
Me and my me and my Global is PALS over

1805
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
Presenting this lecture

1806
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,192
Let's finish the clip

1807
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
And then I'll explain what the lecture is about

1808
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,104
Automatically disprove his earlier statement

1809
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,408
Like the first line where you saying that

1810
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,392
The parable of

1811
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,928
Brave New World

1812
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
1980

1813
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,048
Maybe he has a little bit of

1814
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Personal self in

1815
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Is more right

1816
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:23,264
Orwell's book and I'll get to

1817
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,592
Happy food

1818
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
2

1819
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,272
Decent stand

1820
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Angie

1821
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:42,720
Refinement

1822
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:58,592
This was one of the same side

1823
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
There's

1824
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Hey you

1825
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,840
I think it's my duty to inform you that

1826
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
Spooky background music

1827
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
Great Lakes

1828
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,592
Ominous music behind

1829
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,128
Hopefully we are

1830
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
Buccaneers

1831
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
For about 45

1832
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,088
Music behind me

1833
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,368
May I bring my own

1834
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,696
I'm going to be in the entire time

1835
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,512
So

1836
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,536
Speech

1837
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,376
How old is it 1984

1838
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Fortune

1839
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,168
Right up top

1840
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,240
This is something that Alex big cut-out cuz it's in that

1841
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,520
It's connected

1842
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Do the stuff he was discussing

1843
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
At the beginning

1844
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
Terrorism will not be an issue in the

1845
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,784
He's the reason the 1984 is not

1846
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Compelling model for him

1847
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,624
If he argues that it's written in

1848
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,184
In a time where terrorism is in the public conscience

1849
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,232
But because he had written

1850
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,280
A Brave New World

1851
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:25,376
Terrorism wasn't a hot-button issue for the world

1852
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,424
Because that consideration wasn't

1853
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
And everyone mine

1854
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,008
And everyone's blinded by terrorism

1855
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,544
A1984

1856
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Control state

1857
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,360
Is so predicated on that

1858
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,152
Yeah but it's flawed

1859
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:43,552
Which is a prediction is built entirely around

1860
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
Total Wine

1861
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
That we

1862
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
We are in

1863
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,256
Beijing in production

1864
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,072
Probably right about the pharmacological

1865
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:59,936
.

1866
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:06,592
Lot of people

1867
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
Melanson

1868
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,664
In the speech he goes on to

1869
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,688
Start about how like

1870
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,224
That sort of thing

1871
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
What we know now

1872
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
About pharmacological

1873
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
1 cups

1874
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:26,304
But you could take multiple substances what are you doing drugs if your knots

1875
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,144
Possible

1876
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,424
It does lead the audience

1877
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
Is his version of thing

1878
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,312
And in the speech explicitly says

1879
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,336
That one substance

1880
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,616
Not possible

1881
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Beach his mainardi

1882
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,272
The ultimate

1883
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,344
What are you getting at is

1884
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
History there been a bunch of revolution

1885
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,696
Agricultural Revolution

1886
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,768
Innovation these sorts of things

1887
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,536
King about

1888
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,912
About whenever Humanity made one

1889
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,192
Yes from

1890
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
To another yeah

1891
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,360
The ultimate life

1892
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
Revolution

1893
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
Is that all the password

1894
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,296
The all the past Revolution

1895
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,064
If you look at them

1896
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Agriculture

1897
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
Mechanization

1898
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
Do you sort of revolution

1899
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,440
We're external Revolution

1900
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:27,488
Human

1901
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,280
But we're not really revolutions

1902
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,048
The humans

1903
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,888
They were you know we learn how to farm

1904
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,704
And therefore our lives changed the revolution

1905
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,752
Our Behavior adapt

1906
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,800
Sing to an external thing that we've created

1907
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:45,152
This new Revolution that he's talking about

1908
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,944
Humanity itself

1909
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
Can affect

1910
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
Its own mind body

1911
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,320
Revolution would be

1912
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:55,904
Internal and that at that point there would be no need for other revelers

1913
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
Right

1914
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,720
All he would jerk off to

1915
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,280
Yeah probably

1916
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,840
Important

1917
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,448
We were

1918
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,264
We were we were talking about this a little bit last night

1919
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
We were Tilton

1920
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Two beers

1921
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,616
A wanted man

1922
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
Points

1923
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,152
Of his

1924
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,176
Argument is

1925
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,480
If you look at the study

1926
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,016
There is a

1927
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,832
Subsection to population

1928
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
Percent

1929
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,392
Is almost impossible to

1930
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,488
Similar L 20% that are very suggestible

1931
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
How to be hypnotized

1932
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
Super easily

1933
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,072
Sixty percent of the population

1934
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,096
Somewhere in the middle

1935
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,936
Placebo effect

1936
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,728
20% of people report

1937
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,008
Placebo

1938
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,056
Medication

1939
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,360
20% of people

1940
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Will not

1941
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,408
Respond to that and 6

1942
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,688
People that or somewhere in the middle

1943
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
So

1944
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016
She is warning

1945
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
More than any

1946
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,832
About the fact

1947
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,136
That there are a large

1948
01:36:59,392 --> 01:36:59,904
Group

1949
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,440
Of our population

1950
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,000
That are incredibly easily suggestible

1951
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
And could be a

1952
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
Voided by a demagogue

1953
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,096
No

1954
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,216
That's alarm is not

1955
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,032
You very accurately describes

1956
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,592
How if someone were to

1957
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,872
Utilize

1958
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,432
Some brain control technique

1959
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,712
Expletive been developed

1960
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:27,296
Some sort of propaganda techniques

1961
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,088
But Alex has a lot

1962
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,624
You could get

1963
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
A very

1964
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,952
Portion of that 20% of

1965
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,720
Super easily

1966
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
Suggestible people

1967
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,280
To get on your side

1968
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,304
And that could

1969
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,096
Swing the entire political landscape

1970
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,912
And even and when they are on your side

1971
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
Actively

1972
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
Against their own

1973
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,616
He is incredibly prescient on that

1974
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,920
Yeah I've been all that other stuff about the

1975
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
The future scientific

1976
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
Ditto

1977
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
Dictatorship

1978
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:01,856
Please that

1979
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:08,512
Use as a negative example of what could happen if charismatic leaders

1980
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,792
To wish ill

1981
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,864
Coming to power he phrases it specifically as a negative thing

1982
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
It's something that we should be worried

1983
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:19,776
You know this 20%

1984
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,848
Suggestible people help you

1985
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,128
You swing the political lamb

1986
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,944
Landscape over to this demagogue leader

1987
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,248
This person who wishes to be a dictator

1988
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
They're really smart

1989
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,576
That they'll end up doing

1990
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
He is trying to implement

1991
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:38,208
These pharmacological means to make you happy in your

1992
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,536
Make you happy within your bondage

1993
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,584
Bratz

1994
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
He's not saying

1995
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,888
I'm in with them

1996
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,168
And we're doing this

1997
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:51,008
Yeah he's saying it is like this is a really negative outcome that could happen

1998
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,288
At these are part of

1999
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
The pieces

2000
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,848
Make it

2001
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,152
So I correct

2002
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,480
Almost immediately because the cultural revolution

2003
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Yeah but he was wrong about the terror

2004
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
So anyway

2005
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,464
The reason that I made a big deal out of it

2006
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,232
This is because

2007
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,792
Every time Alex has like a foundational piece

2008
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Says his

2009
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Worldview with

2010
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,864
Really important to knock it out

2011
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
Because it's always a lie or

2012
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,752
Are we can see right there in the clipse we play

2013
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,056
Him literally editing

2014
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,592
Collectively

2015
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,384
The audio of that out

2016
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,408
Clarksville Speedway

2017
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,944
You can go listen to the full thing

2018
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,320
If you want on YouTube like I said I think he's a great orator there's a couple of moments that are genuinely funny

2019
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,600
He's a Charming guy

2020
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,392
I don't necessarily agree with everything

2021
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
He was about

2022
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,768
I think that if you look at his biography he's kind of an a******

2023
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
Yeah

2024
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,656
Miami

2025
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,496
Journey to the End of the Night by El estaline I think it's a great book

2026
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:57,056
He was an anti-semite I don't know what to do

2027
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,104
They were very

2028
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,576
Take razors beside there also

2029
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,112
Shity

2030
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,928
Alex Jones

2031
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:15,232
You are lying about Aldous Huxley

2032
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,280
Congratulations

2033
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:22,656
I'm proud of you later not on this episode but

2034
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
It's always

2035
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,704
Complained about

2036
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Most

2037
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,752
That he does

2038
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,360
Take me out of context

2039
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,688
I never do that to Megyn Kelly

2040
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,992
F*** you

2041
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,576
Yeah your entire reality is based on that

2042
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
I'm certain if we

2043
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:46,976
Entire breakdown of

2044
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,768
Endgame where The Obama Deception

2045
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,304
One of his documentaries

2046
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,352
And I guarantee if we start picking up

2047
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
Piece by piece of Park

2048
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,936
Will find almost every piece of evidence

2049
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,240
Is selectively added or taken out of

2050
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,800
Yeah so if you want

2051
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:04,640
Please don't donate cuz that's gonna work

2052
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,224
Documentaries like to

2053
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
Anyway

2054
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:14,112
August

2055
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,136
30th to get through

2056
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
Before we get to the big

2057
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:19,488
The big enchilada

2058
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,048
Discusses his audio

2059
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,632
Exercise and the personal

2060
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,264
We reach 20 million people

2061
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,056
Post office shows

2062
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,136
Which I've been doing exponential

2063
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,696
Exposition

2064
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,256
The New World Order Engineers do not like me

2065
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:00,704
And the responsibilities I've got

2066
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Is just

2067
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:12,480
Talk to a lot of things that have been posted anonymously on message boards and stuff

2068
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:18,880
The Illuminati

2069
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,672
The truth to you before they do it

2070
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,720
It comes from like

2071
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:27,072
Anonymous posts on message boards of people claiming to be Illuminati Insiders

2072
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,632
And stuff like that

2073
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,032
Really long question-and-answer session really big piece

2074
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
Of this

2075
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,360
Internet mythology about the Illuminati

2076
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,664
Did they use this thing called lesser Magic

2077
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:46,528
Where they reveal what they're going to do to you before you do it so you have free will to try and

2078
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
Them

2079
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,112
It's nonsense it's absolute bulshit

2080
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
Has no basis

2081
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
Isn't anything

2082
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
If you want that to be

2083
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
Your burden

2084
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
Proof

2085
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,352
You are failing

2086
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
Not good

2087
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,912
I do like that

2088
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
The truth in that he

2089
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,472
He did double his audience

2090
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,032
Exponentially

2091
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,312
Exponentially

2092
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:15,712
Really but he is telling us now that it's about 4

2093
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,504
Predictive groundwork for his

2094
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,064
Now I have 40 million Arthur stereo

2095
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,184
This thing I want to take away from that is I don't believe you

2096
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
18 million listen

2097
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:26,976
At this point

2098
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,280
But the idea that he would go from 8

2099
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
18 to 40 million listeners

2100
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
In two years

2101
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,888
Is unfair

2102
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,960
There is literally no way that

2103
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,496
That kind of growth happen

2104
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,520
Without

2105
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,568
Him becoming one of the biggest

2106
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,848
Plucking stars in the world

2107
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,920
Like he would be mobbed everywhere

2108
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,688
People would be

2109
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,760
Camping outside his Studio

2110
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,368
Yeah absolutely I was trying to look up like a ratings

2111
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
TruTV shows

2112
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Diane like

2113
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,232
You would be the most popular thing in the

2114
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
Of course

2115
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,304
Outside of people making memes

2116
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,328
Clowning on him

2117
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,096
I don't think that's

2118
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,656
So he is just

2119
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
It's just a lie

2120
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,032
Does Mexico have to do with why the globalist

2121
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,824
Super into immigration

2122
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
Flooding with left of Western Europe

2123
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,944
Sliding glass of America

2124
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,760
With a political point

2125
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:26,880
Every single argument order

2126
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,952
In the west doesn't capitulate

2127
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,000
And give them what they want

2128
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:36,096
Corner

2129
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,912
We given the terrorism we roll over

2130
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,776
We know you're playing you Despicable Me

2131
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,432
Core people

2132
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:56,320
Behind the scenes

2133
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,088
We're facing

2134
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,136
Nope

2135
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,928
Hardcore

2136
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
They're killing each other salute

2137
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:06,304
You don't like people

2138
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,352
Right right

2139
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,704
Do you understand what are you saying they're about

2140
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
The globalist plan

2141
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
That he can

2142
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
Conceives of his head

2143
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,824
They're paying people

2144
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:21,408
Probably

2145
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,944
Printing is VI goodies

2146
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:27,552
Do you like medicine Medicaid

2147
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,088
And if they don't

2148
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,928
Love the Patriots.

2149
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,976
To the

2150
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,048
Right which is

2151
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
Of the goals

2152
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:45,216
You have millions of people ready to write in every major city

2153
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,520
If all you want out of that is like

2154
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,800
Hey come on guys

2155
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:49,824
Let's use trans

2156
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,104
Instead of tranny

2157
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
You might want to shoot higher

2158
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,480
Yeah

2159
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,528
Seems to me like a pick your battles

2160
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Situation

2161
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
Possibly

2162
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:07,232
That goes back to the being afraid of strangers

2163
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,768
Narrative

2164
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:15,168
These people are paid to basically be there as a warning to us

2165
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:18,240
We don't go along with it they're going

2166
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:20,800
You step out of line they're going to destroy all major

2167
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,824
Tri-Cities right

2168
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:25,664
You can say

2169
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:31,040
They are going to try and kill everything they are going to kill every cop

2170
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
On every

2171
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,136
Beyond Dearest

2172
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
Yeah course

2173
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,256
Gray fighting people

2174
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:43,328
What your your priming your audience

2175
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,120
It's for the moment something goes wrong

2176
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,656
That's the signal

2177
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,424
It's time for you guys

2178
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:51,520
People preemptively to Future violence

2179
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,872
Responsible

2180
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,152
Yeah

2181
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,968
Next caller next caller

2182
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,600
Here is some good evidence

2183
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:09,952
Because I legitimately sucking huge racist caller calls in

2184
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,744
Alex Jones

2185
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
It's cool with it

2186
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,816
Great I Am

2187
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,376
He doesn't push back

2188
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,424
At all

2189
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,472
Call

2190
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,008
Summarizes guy calls in

2191
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,056
We would probably

2192
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:29,664
Hang up on him push back

2193
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
The because Alex

2194
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,992
Welcomes him on the show

2195
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,296
Reinforces what he saying

2196
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,112
Ura

2197
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,136
Pocket racers

2198
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,464
Yeah that's not me using Code words

2199
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:48,864
To try and like take away his free-speech accurately assessing his behavior it like with

2200
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,656
The former Grand Dragon

2201
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
Right

2202
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,728
Information

2203
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,264
Advance

2204
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,288
I'm supposed

2205
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
To be against

2206
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,104
This guy cuz this guy is right

2207
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,896
Unlike that

2208
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
This color

2209
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,968
Has no baggage

2210
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
Associated with

2211
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
Even pretend that he's

2212
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
He can just jump in

2213
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,256
Happily for calling what's your view on all this

2214
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:22,400
So much that I want to say that where me and my brother are really really

2215
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,984
Hardcore supporters are showing pointed to my point I just want to say

2216
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,800
We love your cameo in the movie A Scanner Darkly

2217
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
It was brilliant

2218
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:36,736
As a white male I'm so fed up with this whole blacklivesmatter thing

2219
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,272
I think it's totally

2220
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
Critical 480b cool for black English white people but any kind of white person even looks the black person wrong

2221
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,024
Racist

2222
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:55,168
That's what Obama

2223
01:48:55,424 --> 01:49:00,032
Reconciliation this country

2224
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,848
They know what they're doing is going to make white people

2225
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,128
Incredibly racist

2226
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,808
I can't agree more like

2227
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,184
Everything MTV Downey everything is all the major corporations are doing 50

2228
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,976
What race divides

2229
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,256
Down the middle I mean

2230
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,168
Identify with Mexicans and vice-versa and

2231
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,472
I mean what the endgame I think is it

2232
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,264
Is it really really really bad

2233
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:35,104
Revolution because I think so many white people especially

2234
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,920
Show me hard-working whites are so fed up with saying

2235
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,712
You're racist because of this home

2236
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:43,552
BS White Privilege propaganda

2237
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,856
Appreciate your call

2238
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:51,488
The system knows is a revolution coming because of the

2239
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,512
Criminal government

2240
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
So

2241
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,240
Yeah I don't

2242
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,800
I don't get how you can buy that

2243
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,616
What do you mean by that

2244
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,432
Black lives

2245
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,968
Matter

2246
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,296
Tearing down the Civil Rights funded by Soros

2247
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,600
It's inspired by someone who killed a cop

2248
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,440
I just

2249
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,488
I don't understand what you don't understand

2250
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,328
Hardwood and whites are sick of this s***

2251
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
4 sticker

2252
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,472
All of that s***

2253
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,080
Horse like there's no way that this guy can

2254
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,384
Can actually think the caller or Alex

2255
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
Everybody

2256
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,016
I think that's possible

2257
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
You think so

2258
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
I just I think you're giving

2259
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:58,304
I think there's a lot of people who are too stupid to look at relevant sources I think they're people who just get trapped inside.

2260
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,328
Bubbles of

2261
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
Right-wing propaganda

2262
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,656
They reinforce each other

2263
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,704
And they just don't see anything outside of it

2264
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,520
And because those right-wing propaganda site

2265
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:12,896
Are so vested invalidating any other news

2266
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
Do they ever think

2267
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
The trust

2268
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,736
Oh here's this perspective

2269
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,528
Or they see us story

2270
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:23,392
From somebody who's involved with black lives matter who's explaining what the movement is about

2271
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:28,000
I am dragging up gives a story or even like a Shaun King post something

2272
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:30,304
That's a moving personal story

2273
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,888
Just paid your paid operatives

2274
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
That's their perspective

2275
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,984
It's insane

2276
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,056
What is the law

2277
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,592
If they just

2278
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
Go

2279
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
Maybe

2280
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,176
Maybe that's right

2281
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,456
Make black

2282
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,992
What is the Lost

2283
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,552
Is conservative propaganda Outlet

2284
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:56,416
Dude the game

2285
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
Just be like hey

2286
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,584
You know what

2287
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,864
This is right

2288
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,680
No is good

2289
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:11,776
Is real

2290
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,592
Game where every point

2291
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,128
Every

2292
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,664
In terms of the score

2293
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,968
Not in terms of pointers like

2294
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,296
Okay it's the same reason that the NRA would

2295
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,064
Fight

2296
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,112
Nails for you to keep a bazooka

2297
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,208
The same reason to have assault weapons

2298
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,000
I better

2299
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,536
Rite Aid's Biggs

2300
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
Same reason

2301
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,840
If you give an inch

2302
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
They think

2303
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,400
Everything

2304
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,168
Is gone

2305
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,960
So every single time there is a

2306
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:43,776
Like some sort of an argument and they have a position in it

2307
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,824
They have to stand by it religion

2308
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,944
You know what they might

2309
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Be right on that

2310
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:56,320
Cuz everyone's just like your bunch of assholes

2311
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:01,184
I don't want to fight anymore or you look at the Clinton

2312
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,464
Bill

2313
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
I would love to

2314
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,048
To say with you looked at the Hillary Clinton

2315
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,888
But if you look at that that triangulation

2316
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,656
Strategy

2317
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,472
These conservative

2318
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
Yam

2319
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:19,104
Only destroyed

2320
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,640
That's word end

2321
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,176
You gave them a name

2322
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:26,528
Symmetrical War

2323
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:32,672
Situation where is trying to compromise the compromise

2324
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,464
I will never be

2325
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:38,048
Realize that given a chance

2326
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:40,096
The other side will f*** them over

2327
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:45,984
So rmx or pure in their intention

2328
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,616
Themselves to be way less forceful

2329
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,944
Remember seeing that right now.

2330
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,480
It's f****** healthcare's

2331
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,760
You see the class were

2332
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,528
Warfare

2333
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:01,344
Like billionaires have been waging a war

2334
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,112
Against

2335
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:09,280
One of us blew up a rich guy's house all of a sudden

2336
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:13,632
It's class Warfare all of us don't do that but

2337
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:15,680
I'm not encouraged

2338
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,800
But the same thing there is

2339
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,616
Really is happening

2340
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,384
How many

2341
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,176
Times can a cop murder

2342
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,456
Murder

2343
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,856
That's what that's the whole point of black

2344
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,880
Matter is that

2345
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,184
We don't want to kill cops

2346
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,720
No we want Justice

2347
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,792
We want proof that the rule of law applies to

2348
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
Everybody

2349
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:46,400
Everyone's lives matter

2350
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,936
That's not

2351
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:48,704
Not happen

2352
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
So long is that

2353
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,496
Not change

2354
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,800
How can you interpret it as any

2355
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,592
But white

2356
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
People are still trying

2357
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,456
There are so many instances of like

2358
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:01,760
Vino concert

2359
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
Tatoosh analyst

2360
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,344
Sovereign citizen

2361
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,368
Attacking cops

2362
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,696
That's because they don't recognize their Authority

2363
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,048
Probably

2364
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:16,352
Call Flags anyway

2365
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,656
It's such a tangled logical bulshit

2366
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:20,960
Untangle it

2367
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,776
Present

2368
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
I just don't

2369
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:25,824
Like what

2370
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,432
Constantly thinking about is there a way out of this

2371
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
Snoke

2372
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,736
Because it seems like there is a

2373
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,808
Doing is really documenting the behind

2374
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:41,696
Embassy in s*** that's going on that no one's paying attention to that we'll precipitously and our world

2375
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,560
Because we spend a lot of time with Alex

2376
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,584
And propaganda

2377
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,656
We see things a little bit there's a little tunnel vision

2378
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,216
You know there's a lot of other stuff going on in the world

2379
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,240
It's outside of Alex

2380
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,336
Course that is

2381
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
Insertive

2382
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,920
It's impossible for us to listen

2383
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,456
Listen to a doomsday prophet

2384
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
Any of it like

2385
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,320
Bleed into art

2386
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,512
Titusville

2387
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,816
Then we're about to get to the big

2388
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:19,584
Business

2389
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,376
So Alex

2390
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,168
On August 30th show

2391
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
Before

2392
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,728
He goes off air

2393
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,520
Mentions that there's a big enough

2394
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,360
It's just insane.

2395
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:36,224
You're on

2396
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,016
Your Sunday show

2397
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,040
So you're probably just

2398
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,600
Teasing people on the road

2399
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,416
Maybe it's the fourth hours coming back

2400
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:46,976
Which it already has basically as Rob do

2401
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,768
Like Joe Biggs host

2402
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
In the fourth hour

2403
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:52,608
Also Jakari Jackson he still around is good for that hour

2404
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,632
Sometimes

2405
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,912
We still not seeing him

2406
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,728
This

2407
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,008
Is the big announce

2408
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,056
It comes on August 31st

2409
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,360
Incredibly boring show otherwise

2410
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,224
Cuz it's just him being mad that people killing cops

2411
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:11,552
He also says mother nice things about Sheriff

2412
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,088
But this

2413
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,368
Is the big enough

2414
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,648
And I think

2415
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
That it might be the

2416
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:17,952
The key to understand

2417
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:32,032
The left-wing they can come from religious cults they should come from a far in in

2418
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:49,184
By the way

2419
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,720
Experiment

2420
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,536
This is just poorly constructed on his part

2421
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,072
Yeah it's really hard to lift

2422
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
That drops out here

2423
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,400
Jesus Christ

2424
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:05,312
Free speech and the globalist left has

2425
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:11,712
Accomplish

2426
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,760
Stations in groves

2427
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:20,160
Are not free market

2428
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:26,048
Systems free of competition by offshore combine

2429
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:30,400
How about the law wars.com

2430
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:38,336
Is the left-right paradigm

2431
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:43,968
I want really governing and controlling Society on a mass scale

2432
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:46,528
Bullock is that was legitimately his goal

2433
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,832
If what he thought was

2434
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,880
Really controlling

2435
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,904
A terrible rip-off

2436
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,488
And thinly veiled anti-semitism

2437
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,024
I would be like

2438
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:59,584
Yeah

2439
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,704
If those were his legitimate goals I don't know problem with destroying the right left narrative

2440
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:10,080
I don't think you bring in 3rd 4th 5th party

2441
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
And I do think we should take down the robber baron

2442
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,296
As we did

2443
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:25,696
I don't disagree with that bring back a new deal of very socialist

2444
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:30,304
It would be a good idea yeah but we haven't gotten

2445
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,400
Subtract

2446
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:37,728
We have reached that legendary

2447
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,776
Colossal moment in history

2448
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:44,640
Thousand years of human development

2449
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:52,320
Operation

2450
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:58,464
The first SpongeBob

2451
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,824
And cable stations across North America of millions of more people

2452
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:19,200
Looking for answers

2453
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:25,344
Broadcast live on the 16th

2454
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,696
1747

2455
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
Investigative journalist

2456
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,352
Anne Moore

2457
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:40,704
We are seeking a raise a million dollars so that we can reach

2458
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,752
100 million

2459
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:47,360
Extra people in the next year

2460
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,368
We are

2461
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:01,696
If you put together over you

2462
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:05,536
100 million different

2463
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:10,144
Individuals

2464
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,704
Complete

2465
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:22,432
And other regulations will cost us

2466
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,992
$39,000 a month

2467
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,856
Thousand dollars a year

2468
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:35,232
Dollars

2469
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:40,608
Portion of what we need to do this but it's important to ensure

2470
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,264
With the collapsing economy

2471
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,360
Exposing globalism

2472
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,128
Operator

2473
02:01:56,224 --> 02:02:02,368
As we prepared to walk

2474
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:05,184
Level

2475
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,280
Global Awakening

2476
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:13,376
They're not allowed to talk over this

2477
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,288
Pain in the face

2478
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:28,224
He uses that Gandhi quote a lot

2479
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,504
Sucks for saying that

2480
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,832
Because there are a lot of people who are just being mocked

2481
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,648
You might be misinterpreting if there's an X

2482
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,952
There's not

2483
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
I have a lot of in

2484
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,024
Information about this

2485
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:41,792
Money bomb

2486
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:44,608
That I don't think his listeners were pretty too

2487
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:46,400
I do know one of the things

2488
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,680
Is that he constantly

2489
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,472
Before this is talked about the price

2490
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,240
The closed

2491
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,776
And these sorts

2492
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,800
To feed how much does

2493
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:53,568
Does closed caption

2494
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:57,152
Thousands of month

2495
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
I'm taking issue with the fact

2496
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,016
He's pretending with these are new expenses

2497
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,064
These are things he's doing already

2498
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,880
The video cameras the crew

2499
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,672
He's doing that already

2500
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:10,720
You put the video tape

2501
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,256
Live on

2502
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,536
The internet everyday

2503
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:15,840
Those are the same cameras you'd be using

2504
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,888
This is either not new expensive

2505
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,192
This is just I need money

2506
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,984
Right this is I need a lot of money

2507
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
That's because

2508
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,824
There's something going wrong

2509
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,128
He doesn't have the money

2510
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,664
Keep the operation going

2511
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Okay

2512
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:31,712
Here is where

2513
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,760
My job as an accountant

2514
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,064
Comes into play

2515
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,256
Really like a good accountant

2516
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,560
I don't know a lot I didn't study

2517
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:50,144
There are certain things that I'm aware of

2518
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,936
Because of that job that maybe

2519
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
Some people are

2520
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,752
Y'all one thing I'm aware of it

2521
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:57,056
You know when the end of the fiscal year is

2522
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:04,480
Holyshit he can't pay his taxes can't paste text

2523
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,784
He's already laid the groundwork

2524
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,552
For like

2525
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,576
The irs's

2526
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,856
Collectively trying to

2527
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,624
Intimidate

2528
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,672
Bully the movement

2529
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:18,304
Lois Lerner is selectively all these Republicans are being screwed over for taxes

2530
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,352
He had Peter shipping his dad on

2531
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:25,216
They talk about his dad laying out this text Meredith

2532
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:30,080
I think he's incredibly concerned that he's not going to be able to pay for what he owes to the government

2533
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
Wow

2534
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:33,664
That's why you do this massive money bomb

2535
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:38,784
Right at the end of the fiscal year

2536
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:39,808
By the 30th

2537
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:41,600
When you have to figure out

2538
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:49,280
Even consider that course that's what's going on

2539
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,304
Wow

2540
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,072
Trouble

2541
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,864
20 million

2542
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:58,496
Unique listeners I have no idea what the idea of actual hits to the website in

2543
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,264
And unique it

2544
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:05,664
It's are just anybody who randomly goes to one of his unique

2545
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:09,248
Weekly there are 20 million different

2546
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,040
People there's not here

2547
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,320
Currently

2548
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,880
I was probably about the same

2549
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:20,768
Kids like 150 to 300,000 people that go to his website everyday that's not unique

2550
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
Hits

2551
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:25,888
Yelp I mean his YouTube numbers are incredibly skewed

2552
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,424
Because he's double-counting

2553
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,984
He's counting his show

2554
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,520
Various places it's posted

2555
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:33,568
He's pouting a little clips that he makes

2556
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,336
Hope things

2557
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:37,408
Scrubs the show

2558
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:40,224
So like if someone watches a three-minute clip

2559
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,040
Anime start watching the show and turn it off

2560
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:45,856
You know that's too hot for him one person

2561
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:49,440
Right and they go in like maybe check out one of the articles

2562
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:53,792
It's the same thing that Trump trying to do with his budget

2563
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,352
His audience is so much smaller than anything

2564
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:58,912
They're not buying his f****** weirdo product

2565
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,520
In order to keep this operation going

2566
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,056
Straight horse f*****

2567
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,080
At the end of this year

2568
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,872
Cuz he has outgrown

2569
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,896
Hit his ability to

2570
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:12,736
It's the same reason I don't quit my job to do this show

2571
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:13,504
Because I will be

2572
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,808
Broke as f*** yeah I can't do that

2573
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,392
He is living outside his means of propaganda

2574
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:22,464
He is screwed the timing of it

2575
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:25,024
The fact that it came up immediately

2576
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,328
He teased it one day ahead

2577
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,352
I meant an ounce

2578
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,376
We're doing this

2579
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:32,960
27 hour live broadcast

2580
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:35,520
Sticky with Lelo amount of money

2581
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:37,056
Lueken's liquor

2582
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:43,456
Logan 80s we were going to do a dance competition

2583
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:47,808
Car Wash otherwise old mister Moneybags

2584
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,416
A hundred percent but he knows that he can't frame it that way

2585
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:53,952
Otherwise otherwise he

2586
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:56,512
Completely invalidates all of his

2587
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:59,840
There's no power behind his organization

2588
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:06,240
Well then did that ad in our etherion

2589
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:07,776
Which is over to Trump

2590
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,056
Does he get paid

2591
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:11,104
We'll get to that does he get paid

2592
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,432
We'll get to it I'm not sure

2593
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,968
He is

2594
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,272
Text Mommy and that's why I'm alright

2595
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,320
This is one of the things

2596
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,344
Is that

2597
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,880
I think we've been remiss

2598
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,928
And not considering as a motivating factor

2599
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,976
Like it's the idea of

2600
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,512
Keeping his baby alive

2601
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:32,608
He's essentially broke or not broke broke

2602
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,400
He's not liquid

2603
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:39,008
The red

2604
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:41,312
He has a personal wealth

2605
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,336
That he could just

2606
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,104
Funnel in

2607
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:50,016
Multiple cars that are Myra

2608
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:53,344
The direction

2609
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,112
He personally

2610
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:54,880
Can't pay a tax

2611
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:57,952
I've no idea

2612
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:01,024
It could be a combination of all those things

2613
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,816
So obvious because of the timer

2614
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:06,144
Fiscal year

2615
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,192
And that it's out of nowhere is

2616
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:08,960
Goku in

2617
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,264
Occam's razor tells me

2618
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,288
Is tax-related

2619
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:17,664
Oh man so brilliant the other thing that I think is important like I said

2620
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:18,944
Is that a motivator

2621
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,480
Factor for him to flip

2622
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,504
Could be

2623
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,320
That he realizes the existence

2624
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,600
And the growth

2625
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,624
Of his business

2626
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:27,904
Is screwed

2627
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,184
Without some sort of hell

2628
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:32,000
I believe there is a piece of it

2629
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:32,768
You know like

2630
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,792
People get

2631
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,608
People make really bad decisions when it comes to

2632
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:40,448
Trying to keep something you love a lot

2633
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,728
To keep businesses afloat

2634
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,520
People risk their own lives

2635
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:46,080
To save loved one right

2636
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,360
Decision strictly speaking

2637
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,664
So I don't see it as necessarily

2638
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,688
A possible

2639
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,224
Then he realized

2640
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
Infowars

2641
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:56,064
And then we will be the example of failure

2642
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,112
Against the globalist

2643
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,648
Is that would be an outcome that he

2644
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:02,720
He could not handle XO you make a deal

2645
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,768
And that gets back to why

2646
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:06,560
I think there have been the

2647
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:09,120
I like him but I don't trust him

2648
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:11,936
That's why he's teasing Trump like that

2649
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:12,960
I'm not doing that

2650
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:13,984
Any other candidate

2651
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:16,544
Even when some are saying

2652
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,592
Fairly similar thing right

2653
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,152
So

2654
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,712
I am inclined to believe

2655
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:24,992
And I don't have firm

2656
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,040
But I'm inclined to believe

2657
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,600
That maybe he had already been contacted by one

2658
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:32,416
Donald Trump's people and that's when he stopped talking about the mob

2659
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
Swing in

2660
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,280
Hey baby I'm open to it

2661
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,560
Maybe I'm open to it

2662
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,096
Through his

2663
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:41,888
I don't trust him but I like what he say

2664
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,936
And I'm this money

2665
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,520
Is

2666
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,800
Opportunity

2667
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,872
I believe the reason for the money bomb is motive

2668
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:53,408
And

2669
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,200
I think I haven't listened

2670
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:59,040
To a bunch more episodes after this but I

2671
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,600
Pretty I feel pretty comfortable

2672
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:06,976
That the switch is going to come pretty quick whether or not Rodger Stone shows up

2673
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,768
Lurking in the shadows like that man

2674
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,304
This point

2675
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,632
How funny would it be if it switches the second Rapaport

2676
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,960
I was right there by prediction but it wasn't Rodger Stone

2677
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:23,360
It's all joy is the only

2678
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,640
With his neuralink

2679
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:29,248
Programming the clearly doing

2680
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,040
We clipped we have from 31st

2681
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:35,136
Eclipse from September 1st to get there before we wrap this up

2682
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,928
Right

2683
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,208
Next

2684
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,304
Through the mercy

2685
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:46,144
And that could be where the money's coming from might not be drunk money

2686
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,192
Milo

2687
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:51,264
How could they not look at Alex.

2688
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:56,384
It is entirely possible that Trump

2689
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,432
Self is not the source of the money

2690
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:02,016
Right already indicated

2691
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:06,368
Trump is really as rich as he says he's broke

2692
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,416
Yeah

2693
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
Is

2694
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:14,816
The source of everything already told

2695
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,144
I think that

2696
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,168
Some of these

2697
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:24,288
Investigations that Alex is really worried about in present-day might have the authority to

2698
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
Figure out some of

2699
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:28,640
Maybe we'll get to the bottom

2700
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:31,968
I accept the possibility that I'm wrong

2701
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:35,296
Works

2702
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,928
Damn.

2703
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:44,000
Appeared yet

2704
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,120
Those are the big moneymaker

2705
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:51,424
When I lost leader

2706
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,240
In terms of free shipping

2707
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,264
I don't know if

2708
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,568
Active right all the f****** time

2709
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:03,456
T-shirt there usually on sale for like

2710
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
6 bucks

2711
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,296
There's no way that he's making a good amount of money unless I

2712
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,064
Unless

2713
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:13,184
Cheapest parking shirts in the world

2714
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,720
Let's

2715
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:16,000
Conservative estimate

2716
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:17,024
Isolde

2717
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,560
500000

2718
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:20,864
Right maybe

2719
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:22,656
Donuts

2720
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:24,448
Reasonable

2721
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,264
Let's say let's go 500,000

2722
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
Exist in Alex

2723
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:34,688
But that's like $500,000 Hillary for prison shirts

2724
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:37,504
If you multiply the

2725
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,344
By let's say he has a profit margin when you include

2726
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,368
Shipping

2727
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,648
Panhandling in it

2728
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,672
That he's covering

2729
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:47,744
You have a $6 shirt

2730
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,536
Maybe the shirt itself costs like

2731
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
A buck

2732
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:52,096
To ship a box to ship

2733
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,632
Kind of heavy

2734
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,192
What's a buck

2735
02:12:57,728 --> 02:13:01,056
Let's go out now I see I see your TV show with you as well

2736
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:01,824
Historical B

2737
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:05,664
Buck to make a buck

2738
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:08,992
If he gets them in a big enough bulk order that's reasonable

2739
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,552
Bideford shirt designer

2740
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:12,320
Or whatever

2741
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,088
So

2742
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:14,368
Multicolored that's

2743
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:16,672
Going to come into it

2744
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:17,440
Discharging stick

2745
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:19,488
60 bucks for dollars profit on each

2746
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,816
The entire shirt operation

2747
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,096
Bring some two million

2748
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:26,656
Operation

2749
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:27,680
In terms of

2750
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,216
Employees payroll

2751
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:34,592
There's no way that that is a big enough like even this money bomb saying he needs a million dollars is

2752
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,688
That's a dumb number

2753
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:39,968
To pay attack

2754
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,296
No I think you need more

2755
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:46,624
World based on how much it would cost

2756
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
Studio

2757
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:50,464
The rent on that place alone

2758
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,256
Crazy

2759
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:59,168
I think that that is the

2760
02:13:59,424 --> 02:13:59,936
Come hither

2761
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:00,704
To the donator

2762
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:03,008
I don't know

2763
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:05,056
I think we're getting a little bit too speculative

2764
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:08,384
But we'll see what happens in the next few days

2765
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:13,760
15 *

2766
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:15,552
So

2767
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,344
Before the money bomb that's

2768
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,112
Suggest

2769
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:18,880
It's money

2770
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:19,904
Right I think

2771
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,696
If you make

2772
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,232
Before

2773
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
During

2774
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:28,608
Any of those could indicate to me

2775
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,936
I think so I think so but we'll see

2776
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:35,008
I have said a lot of negative things

2777
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,336
Never enough

2778
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,104
He's horrible

2779
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,920
This next clip the first one we're going to play for

2780
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:42,688
September 1st

2781
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:45,760
I honestly think it's the worst thing he's ever said

2782
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:48,064
Damn I'm not putting

2783
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,344
To find a point on this

2784
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:51,136
I think he's a f****** a******

2785
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,440
And this is terrible

2786
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:56,512
Furious the latest one

2787
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:05,984
Terrible

2788
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:08,032
False reality

2789
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:10,848
Cars driving off cliffs

2790
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,384
Not blowing your tires

2791
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,504
Just the most ridiculous mindless garbage recruiting movie for the FBI

2792
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,552
Homeland Security in the CIA

2793
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:27,488
With this I of God software everything real time with this system

2794
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:29,280
Just just just just utter

2795
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:31,072
Comic book garbage

2796
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,168
Gave me such a headache

2797
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:40,800
But I had to get out of it

2798
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:47,456
Alex what are you go f*** yourself why don't you like fun movies

2799
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:49,760
These are awesome

2800
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:52,576
I can't stand what

2801
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:56,928
Comedic effect

2802
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:00,000
Let's really take a closer look at

2803
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:02,048
First of all it's a fiction

2804
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:06,144
Movie so you can stop pretending that people are looking at it like a document

2805
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:08,448
But then beyond that

2806
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:11,264
It's really interesting about Fast and Furious Beyond them

2807
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,288
Kicking ass

2808
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,824
Those movies are awesome

2809
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:16,896
The other thing is it's one of the

2810
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,920
It's a movie

2811
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:20,480
That uses a really interesting strategy

2812
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,016
And that is

2813
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,296
Incredibly multi-culture

2814
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,832
All the characters

2815
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,112
Different places

2816
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:29,696
They have that Tokyo Drift movie that brought in Japanese characters

2817
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:31,488
There's African-American characters

2818
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,768
There's white characters

2819
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:37,120
There's a character's there are people from all walks of life represented

2820
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,656
There's women who Kick-Ass

2821
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,704
There's all sorts of empowerment

2822
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,240
For all these different types

2823
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,008
Two people

2824
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,288
Beyond that

2825
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:48,896
Ate their set all over the world so they have like this really positive view of

2826
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:53,248
America is well as like Barcelona or Brazil

2827
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:54,528
Now that there is

2828
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:55,808
818

2829
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:58,112
Incredibly uniting movie

2830
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:58,880
And so many ways

2831
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:01,696
And the fact that I

2832
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:08,096
I think it comes from his inability to deal with the idea that these races are working together I think that's

2833
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:08,864
Part of it

2834
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,888
Okay

2835
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:13,216
Cuz that's so big a part of life Fast and Furious

2836
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:15,776
Successful is because the people who were like

2837
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
Japanese

2838
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,568
You can see Han

2839
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:20,896
Is the character and relate to it and see themselves represented

2840
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,176
The badass character

2841
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,712
And it's huge Hollywood

2842
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,016
It's it really great

2843
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,064
It really great for people

2844
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,856
It's really great as a movie

2845
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,880
I think they're wondering

2846
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,464
The Fast and Furious franchise that I have

2847
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,512
Ever heard Hansen's blow up

2848
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,280
Do blowout

2849
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:39,072
I love those movies

2850
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,864
He's angry that it's

2851
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,424
Movie like

2852
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,984
He wants more Cinema verite and his fast

2853
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:49,568
Full movie and one of them they drive a car

2854
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:52,896
Out of a skyscraper into another skyscraper

2855
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:58,784
Do you know why

2856
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:00,064
Parachute with cars

2857
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:04,416
Cars out of a plane parachute gland on a hill

2858
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:09,536
It's awesome because of Operation Dumbo

2859
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,632
40%

2860
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:15,680
Suck yourself the Great

2861
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,216
Certainly better than

2862
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,520
Games

2863
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,056
Even better than

2864
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:21,824
Scanner Darkly

2865
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,360
My baby.

2866
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:29,760
Immediately

2867
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,064
Alex Jones

2868
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,344
Is known on the streets

2869
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:36,160
Is the number one defender of the second

2870
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:39,232
We've seen in every instance

2871
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,768
He sides with guns

2872
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:43,584
He says really stupid bigoted stuff

2873
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,864
Because of his love of guns

2874
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,400
He justifies

2875
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:48,448
Almost every bad position he has

2876
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,216
Because

2877
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:51,776
Eventually it will

2878
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:53,312
Do you think

2879
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:54,848
That he has a

2880
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:55,872
Concealed carry permit

2881
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,152
Because that's illegal Intex

2882
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
Utah

2883
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,648
But you know what

2884
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:13,792
Don't you just be a little bucket

2885
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:19,168
I can officially tell you basically a race Wars

2886
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:23,776
Go f*** yourself.

2887
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:25,568
You don't have a concealed carry permit

2888
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:27,104
What the f*** is wrong with you

2889
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,408
You talked in the past about carry and gun

2890
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:31,200
In the past

2891
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:33,248
Concealed carry handgun

2892
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:37,088
Fair enough

2893
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,368
He's not going to hide

2894
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:44,768
Concealed carry license open carry all the way

2895
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:51,424
Everyday

2896
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,192
Parking permit

2897
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:54,496
Live the life you pretend to live

2898
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,568
Next flip H Jones

2899
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,616
As he is want to do

2900
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:00,640
As he is known

2901
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:03,968
Preemptively blame

2902
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,992
People

2903
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:07,808
Underprivileged classes for the impending

2904
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:08,576
Civil War

2905
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,344
It's going to

2906
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,672
It's that it supports the Immigrant

2907
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,768
The emigrants

2908
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:18,560
Who are heavily depicted in

2909
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:23,424
You're being

2910
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:40,576
And you got to realize you were under scientific

2911
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,624
Because once you fall

2912
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:02,592
What's really going to like the police out

2913
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:06,688
Break music

2914
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:08,480
Right on the Raceway

2915
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:24,864
What to say about that

2916
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:31,264
That's very curious franchise

2917
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:39,200
It's just standard stuff

2918
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,224
Just like

2919
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:48,928
White people kill black people it's fine it's just protecting yourself that should have been

2920
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,512
People they're going to go out there going to

2921
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:55,840
Cause the Patriots to have to kill everybody

2922
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,168
The type of ship

2923
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,960
He's putting out there is

2924
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:02,496
Putting out all of this

2925
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,264
Sphere

2926
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,544
Black people

2927
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:08,640
Has to in fluid like all of the times that you see those cops murdering

2928
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:10,688
Black people

2929
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:11,456
Specific

2930
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,736
There their description

2931
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:13,760
Things are always like

2932
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
Ohira

2933
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,064
Who is 65

2934
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:19,904
He's a huge guy and I was scared for my life

2935
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,440
Amplified

2936
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,464
Perception you have

2937
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,488
From this

2938
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:29,888
Always be on alert because they're bigger they're stronger than

2939
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:31,168
They're doing all of these things

2940
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,448
The only way to protect

2941
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:33,984
Is why firing

2942
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:37,824
Let you know what whatever I realize

2943
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,848
Strangers earlier

2944
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:40,640
What I really should have said his be

2945
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:47,296
I realize I kind of s*** the bed on that turns of phrase

2946
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,064
Booby prejudice

2947
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:49,344
I mean

2948
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,880
That's the long and short of it

2949
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:54,464
That's kind of what his operation is largely about

2950
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,232
Even more

2951
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,512
How to be

2952
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:57,536
Aggressive

2953
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:02,144
The people who listen to Alex Jones

2954
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,424
We're coming in

2955
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:05,728
No coming in like

2956
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,312
Normal regular ask

2957
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,592
Hang out with and then

2958
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,360
Alex Jones

2959
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:12,128
Radicalized

2960
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:17,248
And he amplifies that

2961
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:19,296
You feel good about it

2962
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:21,600
Which Wich

2963
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:22,368
Shoe that I have

2964
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,416
Because he's always fighting against

2965
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,440
Feeling bad

2966
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:27,744
Portable bigot

2967
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:29,024
Because he's always like

2968
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:29,792
Don't make me

2969
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,072
We feel like I'm erased

2970
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:32,608
Don't make me feel like this

2971
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,168
He feels good

2972
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:37,984
He feels good about fighting against

2973
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:41,056
Give his listeners that kind of

2974
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:42,080
Blankets

2975
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:44,640
Except

2976
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,688
Hope they feel it vicariously through

2977
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,784
I feel good I'm about my

2978
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:56,416
I don't have to hide it I don't have to fight against political correctness

2979
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:57,184
Argument

2980
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,208
Is always

2981
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:58,976
About

2982
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,000
Feeling good

2983
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:01,024
About

2984
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,560
Your your

2985
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:05,376
Why is it wrong for me to be proud of my whitening

2986
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,144
Yeah

2987
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,424
Why is that wrong

2988
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:08,704
Princess

2989
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,312
But

2990
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:14,592
I don't know

2991
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:15,616
Proud of

2992
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:18,176
Cool about it

2993
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,760
Celebrating

2994
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,552
Heritage

2995
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,320
Necessarily

2996
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:27,136
Comes at the expense of recognizing

2997
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:29,184
The realities of

2998
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:30,464
Your life

2999
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:31,488
It has been

3000
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,560
Great because of the oppression of other people

3001
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:37,888
Like if you're unwilling to look at that because you're proud of your

3002
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:39,424
German

3003
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:41,984
Swedish Heritage or whatever you know whatever

3004
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,776
Ethnicity whatever culture you come from

3005
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:44,800
Is it comes

3006
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:47,872
Expensive recognizing the reality then that is

3007
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:53,504
Disagree I disagree with

3008
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:57,088
The reason I said that is because

3009
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:59,136
Some people don't look at it as

3010
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:01,440
Skin color is much as it is a look at it is

3011
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:02,464
My German heritage

3012
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:06,048
So I like to wear Lederhosen it

3013
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,584
That's something

3014
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,448
They can play it

3015
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,496
Of course they do

3016
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,264
And Alex

3017
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,312
Help

3018
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:20,896
He's bringing it up like that argument of the West

3019
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,480
Culture that

3020
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,248
Skin color

3021
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,064
Celebrating the fact

3022
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:34,976
For some inexplicable reason my ancestors were like ants but without the

3023
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:41,632
Enjoying and celebrating that culture that that has

3024
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:47,776
A with a lot of

3025
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:49,824
Cloud cover and so our skin is white

3026
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:53,152
Doesn't f****** matter. I mean that's

3027
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:54,176
Faribault

3028
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:56,992
That's the problem

3029
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:59,808
The problem is the idea that

3030
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:00,832
The only thing

3031
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:03,136
That you have no control over

3032
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:04,160
Your skin

3033
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:11,072
Very quintessential

3034
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:11,840
Yeah

3035
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:13,120
The idea of being

3036
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:14,144
Proud of that

3037
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:15,936
Insane

3038
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:19,008
But that's why I phrased it as being cool

3039
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:19,776
But anyway

3040
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:21,056
We have more to get through

3041
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:21,824
A little bit

3042
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:23,360
We got to guess

3043
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,152
Michelle

3044
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:27,968
Are most hated

3045
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:28,992

Do the Obama wants to be king of the Muslims narrative

3055
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:54,336

Like for the longest time I was like you know what nobody wants

3100
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,736
To take your guns away we just want

3101
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:14,624
I want my house filled

3102
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:15,648
I don't have a house

3103
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:26,144
Bedroom filled with all of the guns you have become radicalized

3104
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:29,472
I would like to say I want to steal your gun

3105
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:31,776
Underneath

3106
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:37,152
Deep Earth iodine Crescent

3107
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:40,992
People's guns to be taken away but in the sense of like

3108
02:29:41,248 --> 02:29:42,016
Turning

3109
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:42,784
Your weapons in

3110
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:43,552
Plowshare

3111
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:51,232
But I don't want individually to live in a world where we were past it

3112
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:52,768
Do a like

3113
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:53,536
What are the most

3114
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:55,072
Successful things has always been

3115
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:55,840
Gun buyback

3116
02:29:56,352 --> 02:29:58,144
You know like no question to ask

3117
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,168
Will buy your guns back

3118
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:03,008
Constitutionalist

3119
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,312
We're going to have to break into their home

3120
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,152
Recorder many British soldiers

3121
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:14,528
Because the Constitution doesn't mean anything anymore.

3122
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,064
And I want to take their guns

3123
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,160
I don't fully agree with you but

3124
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:24,256
Just cuz I want to I want to move along here cuz Larry Nichols other point

3125
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,536
Abundant wild okay

3126
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,560
This is

3127
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:28,864
This is delicious

3128
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:31,424
All for the civil emergency

3129
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:36,544
We will will be the ones asking for it because you know what will be scared

3130
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:42,944
Will be scared that something else might as well known y'all going to think I'm crazy but get ready to grease the banana truck

3131
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,528
And I'm fixing to tell you there's a reason tube

3132
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,088
Glass relations with Cuba

3133
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:55,744
Alex you know you people yourself

3134
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:05,984
Under prices condition in this country

3135
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:11,616
You say Obama and his people and I'm sure the general Tortola

3136
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:16,480
When it comes to telling American soldiers Crackdown on the people of America

3137
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:20,576
Julian pretty quick

3138
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,624
Ramadan

3139
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:28,512
He's gone to the one military force that I personally ran into a Nicaragua

3140
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:34,912
No in here under the auspices of all

3141
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:37,728
Milling Allmendinger military

3142
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,776
Keep us in line

3143
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:45,152
Apathetic September the Washington Post and restricted documents

3144
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:53,344
14

3145
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:57,696
Kettering a civil emergency

3146
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:59,232
Obama and the clintons

3147
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:01,792
Those are stuff about

3148
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:04,096
Exercises of operation

3149
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:06,144
Wikipedia Fredo

3150
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:12,544
They're Crossing the Rubicon my friend Canadians in the Mexicans and Obama and the Cuban Army

3151
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:20,736
The widely known Special Forces absolute

3152
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:24,064
Every country up

3153
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:29,184
Cuba not even on the radar

3154
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,488
That's going to be his fourth military

3155
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,816
Larry Nichols is awesome

3156
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,120
Half of Cuba

3157
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:43,520
Then they can take everybody down lyrics

3158
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:46,080
They've been training to America

3159
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:50,688
Alright I really think that the world needs to have a good long conversation

3160
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,760
About the fact that so much of the propaganda about the

3161
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:55,040
Comes from Larry Nichols

3162
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:58,112
We really need to understand that cuz I don't think

3163
02:32:58,368 --> 02:33:03,744
You didn't know his name until we started going through this I don't think most people in the world know who the f*** he is

3164
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,024
They don't know that

3165
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:06,048
He is the source

3166
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,584
So much of this s***

3167
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,120
And he's the kind of guy who's like

3168
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:15,520
Obama wants to become the king of Muslims worldwide

3169
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,288
Come King

3170
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:18,592
Also Obama

3171
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:20,128
The second line

3172
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:24,736
You only normalize relations with Cuba in order to get their military on his side

3173
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:29,600
Richardson radio show and said he was a hitman

3174
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:36,000
For the clintons that killed multiple people and then later said I was on pill sorry I didn't mean that I wouldn't have said that

3175
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:41,120
That I was on Vicodin

3176
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:44,192
So much of this hatred of the Hillary and Bill

3177
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:46,240
Comes directly from him

3178
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:47,008
Lying

3179
02:33:47,776 --> 02:33:50,080
And if we could just have a conversation about that

3180
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,872
And look at all the evidence

3181
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:53,408
We could get rid of

3182
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:54,432
So much of this

3183
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:55,968
I mean we wouldn't it wouldn't work

3184
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:59,808
But if we could have done it ten years ago right it might have helped

3185
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:01,088
Like if we could have

3186
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:02,368
If you look

3187
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,160
Legitimately look

3188
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:05,696
At the situation

3189
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:07,488
Around all those allege

3190
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:09,792
The murders that the clintons are responsible for

3191
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:11,328
You realize that it's all bulshit

3192
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,352
Right

3193
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:13,376
It's it's nonsense

3194
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:16,960
Of course if we could have nipped that in the bud way back then

3195
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:18,496
We might have a tattoo

3196
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,080
Like the right-wing might not have become what it is now

3197
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:26,432
And I see a lot of that at the doorstep

3198
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,968
Fox News and Rodger Ailes

3199
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:34,624
No shirt but they were playing into a lot of the stuff that Larry Nichols starts exactly that's what that's what they were

3200
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:41,536
To actually look into like other guys

3201
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:44,096
Write this is crazy

3202
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:46,912
He's talking about Hillary Clinton f****** Markie Post

3203
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:47,936
All the time

3204
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:49,984
Francisco

3205
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:54,848
Hillary Clinton

3206
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:59,456
Weather

3207
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:02,016
Although it's

3208
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:03,808
Meetings with design

3209
02:35:04,064 --> 02:35:06,880
Smaller-scale I legitimately feel like

3210
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:08,160
We just

3211
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:08,928
CrossFit

3212
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:10,208
The point where

3213
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:10,976
It's too late

3214
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:11,744
With Alex

3215
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,024
But what am I

3216
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:15,328
Sincere feelings about this podcast is

3217
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:17,632
I look at what happened with Larry Nichols

3218
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,400
Clinton

3219
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:20,192
You know 20 years

3220
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,472
25 years ago

3221
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:25,312
I see where the road could have gone to

3222
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,872
And the better world we could be living in

3223
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:30,944
I see what's going to happen with Alex

3224
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,736
It's going to be worse version

3225
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
Discourses already

3226
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:37,344
Descended to Alex Jones level

3227
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:40,672
The news is covering Alex Jones story

3228
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:41,696
The president

3229
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:43,744
Is saying Alex Jones talking

3230
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:46,304
Point he's emailing out Infowars

3231
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,840
It's only going to get worse

3232
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:50,400
Larry Nichols corrupt

3233
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,168
The discourse

3234
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,984
Politically with the is assaults on the clock

3235
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,008
Hammond news

3236
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:56,288
Bucking Gingrich

3237
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,056
Alex Jones

3238
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:59,104
Who's going to turn things on its head even worse

3239
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,384
If people like

3240
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,176
Like I said I think we've already crossed

3241
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:04,992
The line where is it possible to undo the damage

3242
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,784
But God damn it if I'm not going

3243
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:07,808
To try and push back

3244
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,088
Because it's

3245
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,368
The influences

3246
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:17,536
It's it's omnipresent it really is it's really really bad and I appreciate everyone who listens and

3247
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,584
Do it one more quip

3248
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,632
I realize I want it I want to say this

3249
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:23,680
In terms of self-exploration

3250
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:26,240
You're in the moment as we're doing

3251
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,008
Michelle

3252
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,800
Yeah I'm like

3253
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:30,080
You know that thing you said

3254
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,104
15 minutes ago

3255
02:36:32,896 --> 02:36:33,920
Take a look at that

3256
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:38,272
All of my things really forget what I

3257
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:42,880
And I'm looking at myself right now and I'm like

3258
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:43,904
Did I make

3259
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,696
Too big a deal out of that money bomb

3260
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:47,488
Is that did I I mean

3261
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,768
I think this is better

3262
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:58,496
I am exploring like my

3263
02:36:58,752 --> 02:37:03,104
I'm partially critical all the time I'm right there with you

3264
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,408
If you did

3265
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:08,736
Know what I know which is

3266
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:10,784
You might think I was being a little bit extreme

3267
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:13,344
But listen to this

3268
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:14,880

22 Mile Papa care what you're going through but

3277
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,432
I know everybody on yourself are on the fence

3278
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:41,248
It's about this Donald Trump guy running for president here

3279
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:48,416
I'd like you to see if you would approach this fella and see if he might want to support

3280
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:54,816
That's coming up here in the next month

3281
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:59,424
Prefix with kid gloves which is great

3282
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:07,872
Because we are the real deal

3283
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,576
In South Texas last month

3284
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:19,392
I guess

3285
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:23,488
And so

3286
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:28,864
I don't trust him at a gut level but I

3287
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:33,472
If you want to win

3288
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:37,056
Economy Inn off services

3289
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:40,384
Real estate

3290
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,664
Money longer

3291

Economy

3292
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,736
Right there Alex

3293
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:46,784
Contradicted what he said in the past

3294
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:50,624
The frontman for a Consortium

3295
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,392
Service

3296
02:38:51,648 --> 02:38:52,672
Related

3297
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:54,976
Texas money I was just said that in the past

3298
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:57,024
The factory switch the story mean

3299
02:38:58,304 --> 02:38:59,072
So there's that

3300
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,912
Cuz why don't you get drunk

3301
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:03,680
To give you the money

3302
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:04,960
Alex is like

3303
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:06,496
He doesn't say no

3304
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,288
Well

3305
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:12,384
Hardcore politician

3306
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:15,200
Things wouldn't get robbed

3307
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:16,736
Convincing himself you know

3308
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:17,504
Trump just

3309
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:23,136
Reference maybe I should interested

3310
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:25,696
Prosperity

3311
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,488
Piece of it that almost

3312
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,512
Comes off as a gut

3313
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:32,864
Which is like a most mainstream politicians wouldn't get involved with us

3314
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:34,400
You mainstream politics

3315
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,448
There is almost like a challenge

3316
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:39,776
There's code going on here in terms of like

3317
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:41,312
If you look at it as

3318
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:43,360
He's just talking extemporaneously

3319
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:44,384
It's pretty weird

3320
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,176
He's got a weird head space

3321
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,968
But if you look at it is

3322
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:51,040
This is maybe communication between him

3323
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:54,368
And a Bag Man or something like that was some negotiating

3324
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:57,440
There is a subtle indications that he is

3325
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:58,208
Sing

3326
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:00,000
Ready to listen

3327
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:02,816
I don't

3328
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:06,400
Necessarily agree with you in

3329
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,472
It seems like you're giving them a lot of

3330
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:10,752
Credit or you're giving Alex

3331
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,032
What's a lot of credit for

3332
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:14,080
Being able to build up a narrative

3333
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,872
As well as

3334
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:16,640
Communicate

3335
02:40:17,152 --> 02:40:19,456
What are you talkin about there is no narrative today

3336
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:21,504
What are you

3337
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:23,808
Sing about the narrative

3338
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:30,720
That's just my position is

3339
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:33,792
I really like what you saying but I don't trust him

3340
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:40,192
Okay I suppose I suppose The Narrative that I'm talking I like I like what you're saying but I'm ready for you to come

3341
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:43,520
About the narrative

3342
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:48,128
There is your building up this is capable

3343
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:54,016
I know you're

3344
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:59,136
Reminder the clip-ins

3345
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:00,928
What

3346
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,744

I want to take a little

3354
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:34,720
Weird phrases

3355
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:35,744
His part

3356
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,072
Know what he was saying

3357
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:41,376
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt

3358
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:43,936
A warning with Proviso

3359
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,240
Your Proviso is

3360
02:41:47,264 --> 02:41:48,032
What's condition of Anna

3361
02:41:48,288 --> 02:41:48,800
Agreement

3362
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:50,592
But I think that

3363
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:51,872
He's right on there

3364
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:53,664
It whatever

3365
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:56,224
The agreement is that Trump has

3366
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:56,992
To be real

3367
02:41:57,504 --> 02:42:02,624
Like he's made it alright to his listeners

3368
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,416
I'll give you that

3369
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,952
That but it is an interesting term

3370
02:42:06,464 --> 02:42:08,000
Cuz if usually used in contracts in

3371
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,352
Could or could be a little

3372
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:17,472
That you're going

3373
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:19,008
What's the lot done

3374
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:22,080
Very inexpensively

3375
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:23,616
Fox News

3376
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:25,664
Hundreds of millions a year to run

3377
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:32,064
We run this operation for

3378
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:35,136
It's well over 10 million dollars a year

3379
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:39,232
That's why I spend so much time to selling product promoting

3380
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:41,280
And I'm trying to do that because

3381
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:44,608
We have to find ourselves so we can be independent

3382
02:42:45,888 --> 02:42:48,704
See if I got money from Trump

3383
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:50,496
When people claim

3384
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:53,824
Holding

3385
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,616
I've been bought by Trump

3386
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,808
From a cult Brothers

3387
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,976
Where the products we sell in the services we have

3388
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:12,768
But

3389
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,560
It was no strings attached

3390
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:22,240
But I appreciate your call.

3391
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:23,264
That's weird

3392
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,800
That's not great

3393
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:27,104
That's not really good

3394
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:33,504
That's real bad

3395
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,040
100 million.

3396
02:43:36,064 --> 02:43:38,112
No because

3397
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:42,720
10 million dollars doesn't have strings attached

3398
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:46,048
Other than the money that we sent to Iraq that is still no longer

3399
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:50,144
Preemptively

3400
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,424
Getting again

3401
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:53,472
Those accusations

3402
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:55,776
If you took money from from Trump

3403
02:43:56,032 --> 02:44:00,384
So I don't want to take the money

3404
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,408
Flash Forward

3405
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:05,248
Hypothetically

3406
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,016
Four Hands

3407
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:09,856
I wasn't going to do this

3408
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:12,416
Immediately started being his biggest cheerleader

3409
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:14,720
Right

3410
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:19,840
Right I'm not saying the Trump gave him 10 million dollars

3411
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:20,608
Suggested

3412
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:21,632
He would like

3413
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:29,568
I think

3414
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,592
Very

3415
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,128
Very good likelihood

3416
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
What is mercer

3417
02:44:33,408 --> 02:44:34,176
I think

3418
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:42,112
Whoever it is there someone giving him money

3419
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:43,136
This is

3420
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:43,904
I think

3421
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:50,560
I don't know how to say

3422
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:55,424
What are minutes because I'm making a weird argument

3423
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:59,776
Making a weird making a very well-thought-out argument

3424
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:01,568
And there is a lot of

3425
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:05,664
You know

3426
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:07,200
There's there's a lot of Circa

3427
02:45:11,552 --> 02:45:12,832
And it does

3428
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:14,880
If you are looking for it

3429
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:17,440
At 8

3430
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:19,232
Yeah

3431
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:21,536
I think you're you're probably on

3432
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:24,096
I think you might be right

3433
02:45:24,352 --> 02:45:28,192
Probably at this point.

3434
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:31,264
I think my quibble is in the idea that Alex

3435
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,056
Can Maine

3436
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:33,824
Maintain

3437
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:34,848
That kind of cocky

3438
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:39,968
I think in 2015 he was a bit smarter than he has now

3439
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:42,528
Well that's

3440
02:45:42,784 --> 02:45:46,112
Pressures that he has now he didn't

3441
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:49,440
More relaxed

3442
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:51,232
And I think in that relax

3443
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:54,048
Also super male Vitality top headspace

3444
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:56,608
I don't think that it's that crazy that you would be able to

3445
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:57,376
Keep that going

3446
02:45:57,888 --> 02:46:00,448
Because otherwise why wouldn't have been convinced

3447
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:01,472
Trump keep

3448
02:46:03,264 --> 02:46:05,567
Yeah that's being Pig

3449
02:46:05,823 --> 02:46:07,871
In terms of being

3450
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:09,151
Does a cocky dick hole

3451
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:11,199
In terms of being against

3452
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:12,223
What Alex Jones

3453
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:12,991
Perceives as

3454
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:14,783
The establishment globalist

3455
02:46:17,599 --> 02:46:21,183
He clearly is the gotten pissed off a tramp all throughout

3456
02:46:21,695 --> 02:46:22,975
He doesn't

3457
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:23,743
Forum

3458
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:25,279
Yeah but then you've got the

3459
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:26,047
The other argue

3460
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:27,071
Of why would

3461
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,351
You change your mind Trump

3462
02:46:29,887 --> 02:46:30,399
Was

3463
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:33,215
F****** joke never been a joke salad

3464
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:37,567
Throughout the entire time the things the people had made jokes about

3465
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:38,335
Alex

3466
02:46:38,847 --> 02:46:41,407
Still being like how you look at it

3467
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:45,503
Here's the other part that we have to take into consideration

3468
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:47,039
Donald Trump

3469
02:46:47,295 --> 02:46:48,063
Campaign

3470
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,879
Largely worked off of propaganda in

3471
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:51,647
In Gossip

3472
02:46:51,903 --> 02:46:56,511
There was a major like whoever was running his campaign at any given time

3473
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:58,047
Seem to be very interest

3474
02:46:58,303 --> 02:47:00,863
In rumor-mongering and propaganda

3475
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:03,679
To think that they wouldn't have actively tried to

3476
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:04,703
Court Alex Jones

3477
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:05,471
Subway

3478
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:06,495
Is crazy

3479
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:11,103
Do you think you think it's possible that they came to Alex

3480
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:16,735
I think Alex at the moment

3481
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:17,759
Talking about the mob tonight

3482
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:23,135
You think so

3483
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:27,487
The other check

3484
02:47:27,743 --> 02:47:29,023
Past I don't know if I could

3485
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,071
On a gut-level I don't trust him

3486
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:34,655
He was talking much more specifically

3487
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:38,495
About how is your name is Genevieve you get arrested if it's Trump you don't

3488
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:40,287
Right he's not Richie

3489
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:41,055
The frontman

3490
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:43,871
Before that

3491
02:47:44,127 --> 02:47:45,407
Day when you made that pivot

3492
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:47,455
He was talkin about having

3493
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:49,503
High-level information from people

3494
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:51,039
He was using

3495
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:57,439
He's everything that wasn't his Source back then

3496
02:47:57,695 --> 02:47:59,999
Laundering

3497
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:03,071
Yeah I I I don't think necessarily it was someone

3498
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:03,839
I'm from

3499
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:04,863
Campaign

3500
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:07,935
Intermediary

3501
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:08,703
Some cut out

3502
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:09,727
Is Rodger Stone

3503
02:48:14,847 --> 02:48:17,663
So I I think that's possible and I

3504
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:18,431
I don't

3505
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:22,527
I don't know if it was a situation where they were like will give you a ton of money to

3506
02:48:22,783 --> 02:48:23,295
To promote Trump

3507
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,831
Not something like that

3508
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:27,903
I think there's probably some bit of an in

3509
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
Influence

3510
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:31,231
Situation

3511
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:33,023
You need a favor we need

3512
02:48:33,791 --> 02:48:36,095
Well and they can sell it cuz

3513
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:37,119
Do you know Alex

3514
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:39,167
So jumpy on guns

3515
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:39,935
Immigrants

3516
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:40,959
Abortion

3517
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:42,239
Yeah

3518
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,007
Is your guy

3519
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:45,311
They can use

3520
02:48:45,567 --> 02:48:46,591
His vague

3521
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:48,383
Suggested position

3522
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:49,151
Trump

3523
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:51,711
To feed into Alex's need for a savior

3524
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:55,039
And isn't it

3525
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:55,807
Right

3526
02:48:56,063 --> 02:48:58,367
I think that and Rand Paul is not paying

3527
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:03,487
Alright

3528
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:05,791
Ego

3529
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:06,559
Motivation

3530
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:08,863
Schlitterbahn

3531
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:09,887
Yeah I think

3532
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:11,935
She got the broken

3533
02:49:12,191 --> 02:49:13,983
I think it's not all that crazy

3534
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:14,751
Suggest

3535
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:17,823
That turning point of I'm not going to

3536
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:19,615
These negative things about Trump anymore

3537
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:21,407
Would precipitated by something

3538
02:49:23,711 --> 02:49:26,015
It possible that one of his employees and legal

3539
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:31,391
Just like you could get sued for that or something

3540
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:35,487
That would be enough

3541
02:49:35,743 --> 02:49:36,511
That wouldn't hold

3542
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:37,791
Kraken Court

3543
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:40,351
Yeah I think

3544
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:41,631
That

3545
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:42,911
When you combine

3546
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:45,215
A surprise money bomb

3547
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:48,031
A day after

3548
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:50,847
With

3549
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:53,151
The timing of the end of the fiscal year

3550
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:55,199
You now have opportunity

3551
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:56,991
You haven't needed on Alex

3552
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:59,295
Cuz part that can be satisfied

3553
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:01,343
Buy some really rich donor

3554
02:50:01,599 --> 02:50:04,159
Here is the here is the other conspiracy

3555
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:05,695
Go from there

3556
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:06,719
The money bomb

3557
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:08,255
Cover that's what I was

3558
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:10,303
Obama's like

3559
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:15,935
Stated our goal for the month Bob which suggests that the listeners did everything

3560
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:18,239
But maybe he got a lot of that money

3561
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:19,007
Play from

3562
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:21,311
Intermediary or the Mercers

3563
02:50:24,127 --> 02:50:26,175
That's what I've done what I'm talking about in terms of

3564
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:27,967
Like the the motive

3565
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:30,783
Alex's need

3566
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:32,063
The opportunity of

3567
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:33,855
The cover of the money bomb is there

3568
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:34,623
In terms of

3569
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:35,391
Cloaking thing

3570
02:50:35,647 --> 02:50:38,207
Cuz it doesn't have to change what is listener

3571
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:46,143
He's already laid the groundwork with I don't know if I can trust him but I like all the things you say

3572
02:50:46,655 --> 02:50:48,703
You should support Trump wear support Trump

3573
02:50:49,215 --> 02:50:51,775
And all you have to do

3574
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:55,359
To make

3575
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,383
Have you like guys

3576
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:57,663
This is enough

3577
02:50:58,175 --> 02:50:58,943
I've heard enough
