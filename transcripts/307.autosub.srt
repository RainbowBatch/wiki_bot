00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Beverages a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Jordan

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,248
Who is 112 titles

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
Okay I know I don't know nothing about this for I am nothing

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
But I know that it's Raza

7
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
Everyone out there who doesn't know Jordans

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,960
Insane

9
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
6161 in the final

10
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
Incredible he's got a perfect forehead

11
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
That's fair enough

12
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
I have the reverse situation

13
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
Indeed

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Interesting episode we're going back

15
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
To the past to 2013

16
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
About Alex

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
The coverage of stuff after

18
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
We are

19
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Currently

20
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
Interesting

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
Groundbreaking happens

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
But

23
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Do I find it very

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Big picture Aretha outside of this podcast what happened

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,192
It's not a difficult

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Variance

27
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
To take a little time

28
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
I really appreciate it so first of all John

29
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
You so much you're now policy walk

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
I'm a policy wonk

31
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Thank you so much and I'll probably walk

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
Next Kyler thank you so much

33
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm a policy wonk

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
You're an alcoholic

35
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,688
Finally somebody donated

36
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
So I regret

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
This but

38
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Tina saurus dick

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Before and I have I taken

40
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
McGrath

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
Freakishly large

42
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
Thank you so much

43
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
03

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
The show

45
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
We would appreciate

46
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,608
We would you know this February 3rd

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
2013

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
It was a Sunday

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
It was

50
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Okay Super Bowl Sunday

51
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
To do about stuff that has nothing to do with the real worth

52
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,528
War ritual

53
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
There's a lot of bulshit

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
On that day about how like

55
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
I'm not into football

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
I'm in the arena of the real world

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Very much

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Does he just do the same

59
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
Episode of Every Super Bowl Sunday I feel like I've heard him say that

60
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
He's not into football

61
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Every single time

62
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
Somebody who's heard a number of them there are

63
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Okay but it's

64
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Very

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Similar shows

66
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
He uses the Super Bowl existed

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Football

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
Imply that he's more of a man than

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Sports

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Cool

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
A Greek youth

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
He seems a little bit upset about the commercials

73
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Deceived

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Upset about

75
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Acquire

76
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Performing

77
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
At the halftime show

78
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
But he's not really

79
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Upset about it outside of being like

80
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
They just want to turn everyone against gun

81
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
It's not it's

82
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
That offensive

83
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Not really that crazy

84
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
That's because they're probably

85
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
They were there

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
To him so why would he

87
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Continue

88
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,183
Taking them from that point of view because he stopped

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Yeah

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
So the show itself is not really all that

91
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
Interesting but he does take

92
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Recalls

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Second hour

94
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Can you get the call that

95
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Very

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
This caller

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
And then flips it on him

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Eyedrops a reference

99
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
But Alex knows what it

100
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Anybody

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Who studies hours

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
6 knows what it mean

103
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
But Mike

104
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Confuse the owner

105
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Who is Mallory Mahoney

106
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,047
Mallory Mahoney is one of our I grab a table or chair at the office

107
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
When she formerly was Stratford

108
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
Appreciate your call

109
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:33,055
Here

110
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Intelligence-gathering farming

111
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Get out in Georgia

112
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
This is for Prince

113
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
So this caller

114
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Is

115
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Lawyer

116
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
A criticism on Alex

117
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Around circling the idea

118
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Control

119
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Right

120
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Big about

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Chinese conspiracy worlds

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Conspiracy Circle

123
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Username

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
What they're trying to say

125
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Controlled opposition

126
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
Maroni

127
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Who are you guys

128
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Getting wrong

129
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Internet strength

130
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
After Alex didn't

131
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
To write some

132
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Books

133
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Mark Dice

134
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Turn on Alex Jones

135
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
It started making videos but however

136
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
Bring up Molly

137
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Opposition

138
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
Those videos mysteriously all disappeared

139
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Real fast

140
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Somebody say that

141
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
That's the example

142
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Paying off large

143
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
But it's cool

144
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
We started making s*** up and then wants out

145
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
He got got back to

146
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Friendship whenever you're

147
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Friendship is based on the transaction anyways

148
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
Either way as a non insane human I definitely respect Alex's

149
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
The response that caller

150
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,831
He's clearly been frustrated by these accusations but he doesn't seem like he's responding with the kind of blind rage usually

151
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Valid credit

152
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
His explanation for why

153
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Used to be an intern at Stratford might end up working

154
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Makes total sense

155
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
So in order for someone to make the

156
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
I'm going to

157
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
A little bit more damage

158
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
In order for this like

159
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
It's a clear

160
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Proof

161
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Clear

162
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
None of this

163
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
It's transfer is not ashamed

164
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
That's a matter that other outlets for probably cover way more comp

165
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
I'm only concerned

166
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Just checking in on the argue

167
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Text Alex to stratfor

168
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
That is my

169
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
I want to believe

Important to know what he's up to in the Maurice

Recent days

With great trepidation I announce that I have the so-called Messiah

191

Call the Messiah

192
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Believe that

193
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
You should not want

194
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
To be king

195

00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
CIA headquarters beneath Lake Geneva

200
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
EnV so-called chosen

201
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,335
That's like mailing something to yourself because you can't afford the copyright

202
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
So he goes on to quote

203
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Although Jesus Christ exist

204
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
The 2,000 plus years ago called the title of Messiah

205
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
DMV savior of mankind

206
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
The reality is that mankind didn't need a savior back around like they do now

207
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Therefore the story of Jesus depicted in the Holy Bible is the story of the

208
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
The future Messiah which is now

209
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Chase Taylor

210
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Aside from all the physical traits

211
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
Celebrities the trials and tribulation

212
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
And suffered by Jesus over

213
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,175
According to him

214
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
I can't vouch for that

215
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
The persecution of Legend

216
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
Doodly suffered by Jesus

217
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Persecution

218
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
Over the last seven years just left the safety

219
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
Yeah that's cool dude

220
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
Real good source of information guys

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
Winner

222
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
You like

223
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,063
From what I can tell from his website he's mostly posting

224
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Open letters to journalist

225
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
Every few days that are basically

226
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
In case I get killed in the next few days. Who did it

227
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Just roll over and die

228
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
Eddie never gets killed

229
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,311
That I just totally

230
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
Zayn Malik high-level paranoid to play

231
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Score

232
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
Consider that the source of the

233
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
You traced back to an article written by that

234
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
Nautical gear the bass

235
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
The claims that he

236
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,791
Alex is in Austin and Stratford headquartered in

237
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
So there's a geographic

238
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
You've already you've already solved that conundrum I believe wholeheartedly

239
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Are we connected

240
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
To them

241
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Oh s*** we are no Allstate

242
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,455
Safe Harbor boat base your butt I don't even I don't have private insurance

243
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Let alone is there any connection

244
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
To the insurance

245
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Geography is nothing

246
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
That means

247
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
0

248
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
The second piece

249
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
The connect

250
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
According to

251
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Alex's career begin

252
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Began his run on kayjay.

253
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Texas Public Access

254
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Free date sites

255
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Also Infowars itself wouldn't actually be founded

256
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Google 1999

257
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
So I don't really think there's even a

258
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Like a chronological connection

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Just throwing spaghetti

260
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Yeah I like to entertain

261
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
Intelligent

262
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Employees to create analysis

263
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
But they disseminate

264
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,231
That's okay worthwhile as a connections

265
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
They both use

266
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Pizza ovens to make

267
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Pizza at Papa John's

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Connected

269
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Exactly

270
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
All the 4th Alex Jones is supposedly a conspiracy theorist he's friends with celebrities

271
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Joe Rogan

272
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
Is celebrity

273
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
That's not this

274
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Alex Jones

275
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Since transfer release

276
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Intelligent

277
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
911

278
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
Sodas

279
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
It doesn't mean any

280
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
This is just selectively using a couple pieces of info

281
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
Information to create

282
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
False connection that you want

283
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
To appear in the world

284
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
As if David Chase Taylor took all the time

285
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Information

286
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
And made his argument

287
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
But Alex's

288
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Working for Stratford

289
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Yeah I think

290
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
You probably was up until

291
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
And then they

292
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
That's what makes

293
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,623
You think the killer was held up

294
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,511
There's one other piece of his argument though and that is that David Taylor says

295
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
The tractor is a Zionist

296
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Massage run

297
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,471
And Alex is married to it that that's a big part of speech

298
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay I was wondering if

299
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
That is what's really behind.

300
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
Force transfer narrative that's based on The Incredibles

301
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Inclusive

302
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Secretly working for

303
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
It's all about the idea of Alex working

304
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Stratford is annex

305
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
Exclamation for why he won't come out and admit what they think

306
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Obvious truth

307
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Set the NWO in all the world

308
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
System re-bag

309
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Jewish

310
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
I reviewed a ton of

311
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Conspiracies that have spun out of David Chase

312
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Sailors blog post attempting to eat

313
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
There is the temperature in expand on the. Make more connections

314
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Between Alex and Stratford

315
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
They're old

316
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Super week

317
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,575
They all come back to people who are mad that Alex won't publicly say that the real enemy is

318
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
But I've always

319
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Considered

320
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
The back of my mind

321
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Is how valuable having anime

322
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
Yeah for someone like Alex who's vulnerable

323
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,239
Get out of jail free card

324
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
People were way more

325
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
Attacking you for not being

326
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Yeah it's it's a really valuable thing

327
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
It turned out that

328
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Spectrum

329
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Makes it so difficult

330
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,599
Yeah also if Molly Maroney was some kind of

331
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
Deeply embedded intelligent agent

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Infowars

333
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
They would credit her under

334
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Real name

335
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
Her at all vehicle graphic designer

336
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Infowars Maga

337
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
What's the

338
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Look

339
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
Just because you're a secret operative doesn't mean you don't

340
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Do you do the work you get the credit

341
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
The government always gives

342
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
She's lifted

343
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
In the credits

344
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Is almost indication

345
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,791
It all makes me even less

346
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Seems to have gone on to have a

347
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Career in Visual Arts

348
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Propaganda

349
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,751
In 2013 after she ended her very short time but Infowars

350
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Just called Sprat

351
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Spra

352
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Austin Texas

353
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
MJR they do this really cool thing called free art Friday

354
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
I'm not sure if they

355
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
More artists

356
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Pieces of Art

357
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
They created around the city

358
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Define to take home

359
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
They post Clues on it

360
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Instagram is where the peace

361
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Lisa's work

362
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
The most fun

363
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Super taking something like that but I

364
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Also not so jaded that I think it's

365
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Especially if

366
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Come on

367
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
A former Infowars employee goes out and goes

368
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
F*** that entire world

369
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
We're going to play hide and seek with art

370
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Read Beauty

371
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Oriented

372
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
I was waiting for you to take

373
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
Dart services

374
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Providers

375
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
I've never met her but from everything I can tell Bali Maroney

376
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Really cool

377
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
In fact the only thing I can really find about Elizabeth

378
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Infowars

379
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
Which totally is understandable

380
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Coming out of college

381
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,711
Explanation for why somebody would take that position

382
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Perfect sense

383
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,551
No his explanation for why somebody would have

384
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,671
Still works

385
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,863
So I don't know I think this is important

386
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Piece of like

387
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
AMC Alex Jones

388
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
World like a lot of

389
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Critical of him

390
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
To the level that you and I are

391
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
A lot of them get really sidetracked

392
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
That sort of Molly Maroney world

393
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
He works he works for

394
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Stratford

395
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Flame

396
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
You'll get a better

397
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Albert says something

398
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Teamsters

399
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Imply

400
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
That he does believe

401
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
There were actors

402
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Which

403
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Is not good

404
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
It's clear that at least in the background

405
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Kind of what

406
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Mental illness

407
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,727
I think what he's saying is

408
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Crisis actors

409
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
Is this yeah

410
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
But it's so muddy

411
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
Like what he's expressing

412
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
I'm saying that

413
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
If this

414
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Professor

415
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Florida

416
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
It's a reasonable

417
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Miski ringer

418
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
I think I agree with you his meaning was

419
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
And that has happy

420
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
There have been

421
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
He is not necessarily

422
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Confirming

423
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
But it's closed

424
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Is real close

425
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,591
There's really not a whole lot going

426
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
It's pretty boring

427
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
I think he's probably concerned about his his bats

428
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
I get into Monday and

429
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Talking Bone to pick

430
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Oh yeah

431
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
Which one Barack Obama he had put out

432
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
Themself

433
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
At Camp David how dare how dare this man with a gun

434
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Can you talk

435
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
You got to get them coming you got to get them going

436
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
There's nothing you can do this right

437
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Shotgun

438
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,495
Firing shotgun

439
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Firing handgun govern over again

440
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
That looks like a fake photo

441
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
Furniture the controversy that

442
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
No one is allowed to photoshop

443
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
This is only for media

444
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
So

445
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
First things first

446
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
Can't Photoshop or use the insta permission

447
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,720
That's a boilerplate disclaimer that literally apply to every picture on the White House that they were

448
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
No one ever in

449
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Horses

450
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
But it's Universal thing

451
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Is making a big deal out of

452
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
Because the Daily Caller

453
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
The conservative trash rag run by Tucker

454
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
Carlson made a big deal out of that

455
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
You can't Photoshop

456
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
They pretended that it was

457
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Suspicious detail

458
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
True The Daily Caller articles that boosted by drugs

459
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Alex picks up

460
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
And now he's got a conspiracy that Alex says

461
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
You can't Photoshop app

462
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,416
A picture of him with a gun Dan I will tell you this right now

463
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
The Cubs won last

464
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
But I can't tell you anything

465
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
Singh further without the

466
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
Express written consent of Major League Baseball

467
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Right

468
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,704
Then they told me that because something happened

469
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Completely manufactured by Pilot

470
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
So

471
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
I'll tell you this to

472
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,992
Not much going on not a very exciting

473
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Important

474
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
I need to not that Lord moms

475
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Okie dokie.

476
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay of course

477
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
What's important

478
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Is that Alex gets a call.

479
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
The tips him off

480
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
That's certain.

481
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Somebody

482
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
It's coming to Texas

483
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
And Alex

484
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Is not happy

485
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
Piers Morgan

486
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Again

487
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
Because he's coming into our territory

488
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,664
So Alex is herded a Morgan is going to a gun shop in Katy Texas

489
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
And he is going to f******

490
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
Finish the show and run

491
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
What is this round this is the Thrilla in Manila this is with the rubber mat

492
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Batman

493
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Kind of eggs

494
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
The show is

495
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Coming to an end

496
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
He's getting towards the end of the show

497
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Diesel

498
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Struggling with

499
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Trip

500
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Katy Texas by Houston

501
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Like I got a

502
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
I don't know is it

503
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Piers Morgan actual

504
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Even going to come or not

505
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
Yeah

506
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Go away

507
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
Exxon

508
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
Closing early

509
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Special event

510
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,704
Producers phone numbers

511
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,064
Amazing ladies and gentlemen

512
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
I was just trying to get his audience

513
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
Succumb to he's trying to turn this into a

514
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
So this is exciting

515
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
My favorite part

516
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Anytime he hasn't

517
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Surprised like

518
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,040
Oh I got to go here

519
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
He always tells

520
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
That's what he was going to be

521
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Coronavirus

522
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
I was listening

523
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
These episodes

524
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Very little

525
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
To talk about here very little that interested

526
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
The Super Bowl to the power outage

527
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
During the Superbowl was 33 minutes long because

528
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,440
Illuminati signaling the globalist

529
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
Is the power going out

530
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
I just sitting there like

531
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Oh my God

532
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
I just listened to

533
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
I can't

534
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
I cannot

535
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
Interest myself in researching

536
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,336
I just cannot

537
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
Implied

538
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
I really do look into the power outage

539
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
What caused it

540
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
So

541
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
For something I needed I needed

542
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,168
Morgan coming to f****** Texas

543
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Is it

544
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Exactly what I need

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
It's coming

546
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
And he's like oh my God

547
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,152
The last time I got

548
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
Already

549
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:37,856
So popular I talked about it for a week I sold so many pills

550
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
It was great

551
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
I got to do it again

552
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
I have to

553
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
So

554
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Here is

555
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Alex Jones

556
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
Confronting

557
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Piers Morgan

558
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,448
He shot videos there's a video

559
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
Now paid very close to 10

560
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
To how

561
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Sad

562
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Alex

563
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
If you quote a confrontation

564
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
What's your daughter says that's around here

565
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
Globalsign

566
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Play the

567
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
They want what is a

568
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
It's good that I had a fever was actually sick that's why I was sweating

569
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,432
Almost

570
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
So

571
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,880
In 30 seconds Alex multiple times ask

572
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
To be back on his show

573
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
I'm not in a you're afraid of me kind of way

574
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,168
Viral like a lot of people

575
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
It is not the Alex

576
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
But he likes to

577
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
To present himself as

578
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
That is an Alex

579
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
Where are you

580
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Pull this off

581
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
I will get back on 3

582
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
My reach will expand even

583
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
That is literally like a first-time

584
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
Screenwriter walking up

585
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
Does Spielberg and being like if you want to take a look at this

586
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Again

587
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
To be back on the show

588
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
Why don't they promote you that much on it

589
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
You can't be first film

590
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,264
He's right there

591
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
You have to go

592
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
Alex gets kicked out

593
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
It's presented like

594
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
Sort of stealth footage

595
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
And it again it's her being likes

596
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
AAA

597
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Now that was very

598
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
Sycophantic very

599
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Weasel

600
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
Very hate to see a guy brought that love

601
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Would like to see you

602
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
And how he would like you to

603
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
To see him

604
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
How he sounds once he gets outside

605
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
He has his rally

606
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
In front of him

607
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
At all of his fans

608
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
Sounds very

609
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,368
We don't agree

610
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,464
What's going on here

611
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
You know you lost this round

612
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,416
You sho got a picture for me

613
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:36,448
Opportunistically

614
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
Everybody

615
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Collaborators

616
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,088
He wants to present himself as it goes into the Green Room is

617
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Go back on your shelf. No Alec

618
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
The claim of

619
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Like in court

620
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
If they want to do like hey this is all an act

621
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
After this is all bulshit

622
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Play those two clips back

623
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,448
Back-to-back and everybody black

624
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,312
You know what's Wild to me is that Alex put out the video where he's talking

625
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
Piers Morgan yeah I didn't have to put that down that's all

626
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
From seeing is just like look at how fake and bulshit this guy is

627
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,208
I can't imagine what would possess a person

628
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
2

629
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
To do that

630
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
Like guys that present themselves as so

631
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
Two faces but whatever

632
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
So the Alex has his rally he's yelling into a bullhorn and there's two

633
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Understands the videos him

634
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
Getting interviewed by the local news station

635
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
Exactly what you wanted

636
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
He went down there to cause this

637
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:59,392
Listeners out in order to create the appearance that there's something actually going on

638
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
That'll attract the local media

639
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
He gets some sort of

640
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,304
Footage of him with Piers Morgan

641
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
Damn and then it doesn't matter cuz

642
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,496
With this van behind the wrestling promo

643
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
Shooting on Pierce

644
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Hey man I was

645
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
Just trying to

646
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
I'll just try to

647
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Be nice to him

648
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
I didn't want to offend

649
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
The gun store owner

650
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
That's who you are

651
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
You are the guy begging

652
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
To get on CNN

653
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:33,184
Romantic good idea when we were in Austin we should have gotten a few listeners

654
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
And held a rally outside of his Studio try to get the local media on there

655
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,216
Where is Norwalk

656
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,824
I think that would be a 0 for the Press

657
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
But the 1990s

658
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,968
And we get shot by the snipers

659
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
So he goes out and he does that

660
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,576
And obviously

661
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
They comes back

662
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
And I have a strong suspicion that you might a party

663
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
The night after

664
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Market price

665
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
This does not

666
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
Stand up live

667
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Usually they're really regular I forgot this morning

668
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Whatever the case

669
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
Whatever the reason

670
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
He's an unknown sleep

671
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
He is on no sleep

672
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
And it's not

673
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
I think he played some unforced errors on

674
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,984
On the show and if that's a product of not sleeping

675
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
That's good

676
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,080
But it's not

677
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Yeah if you just starts off the show

678
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Sport for

679
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,064
Vigilante

680
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
America

681
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,264
You cannot support that Alex that is not good

682
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
You don't want to be alright

683
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
Determining what is and what is not

684
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
Sincere vigilantism

685
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
The cops are killing unarmed

686
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
Black people

687
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Government

688
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,136
That you want them to take

689
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
Sitting around hands when those cops are

690
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,768
How to prevent an interesting case study Alex

691
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
The mama

692
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
I don't know

693
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Dangerous press

694
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
Because if you're supporting

695
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
Vigilante group

696
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Then

697
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,224
You don't have a lot of lot of firm ground to stand on

698
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Talk about

699
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Going to yell at Piers Morgan

700
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
He has he's

701
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Standard

702
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Excuse for why the footage

703
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
Just better

704
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,024
This happens every single time he goes and does any

705
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Topsy and Tim was behaving behind the scenes

706
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Are you ready

707
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
So funny

708
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
So

709
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
Settlement

710
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
It's always do

711
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,976
Just didn't get it on camera but you know it

712
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Such a fun feature

713
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
That dovetails with everything else because you're a conspiracy theorist

714
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Of course you couldn't

715
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
The good stuff

716
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
They're too smart for

717
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
Like being lazy

718
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
Plays in the good kids

719
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
As opposed to actually putting effort into making something

720
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
It's it's good

721
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
It's real good stuff

722
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Talks about

723
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
Really want to go back on Piers Morgan

724
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,192
Three times in a minute to go back on his show

725
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:34,592
Why are you talking about

726
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
People are sick of it they want

727
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,448
Supposed to get in the face of the gun grabbers

728
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Just sad

729
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,920
You going on why can't I get back on I need another hit

730
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Yeah yeah yeah

731
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
I do believe him when he says

732
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,832
Even Ted Nugent is going back on people

733
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
MacGyver that was a very direct

734
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
I enjoyed that

735
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,072
Let that checks out interviews

736
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
The guy who owns

737
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,472
The gun store

738
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
This is insane

739
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
This guy

740
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Complaints about Piers Morgan

741
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,920
Says that's a adjective the interview to make him look stupid

742
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Sure

743
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,504
Short short short short I don't know how much that is true I don't

744
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
Particularly care

745
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
I'm slightly Petty

746
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Is

747
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,920
You're paranoid

748
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Ridiculous

749
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
Ridiculous

750
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
Moment of insecurity you have on actually real things

751
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
The idea that isn't

752
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Security self-generated

753
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,288
Even even that has to be a couple of people

754
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,688
Forcing him to feel embarrassed sneaky plan of people trying to highlight his belly

755
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:52,832
Look good on camera

756
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Retro ridiculous

757
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,000
You care about Alex interviewing this gun store owner it's not particularly

758
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
There are two horses about that are getting

759
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
The only reason that I actually even

760
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
I think that it's very worth our time

761
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Is that

762
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
This

763
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Text Colette

764
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Is one of the few times

765
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
I have ever heard Alex given

766
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Actual apology

767
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,736
I have almost never even when he's had to give

768
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,808
Formal apologies to like James alefantis

769
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,928
Hamdi ulukaya I still think that this is one of the only real

770
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Sincere apology

771
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
She's ever given

772
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
That's alright thank you brother

773
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,256
Wow only people

774
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,632
Hope Road apology if you remember in the first earlier episode

775
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,240
Gun gun shop

776
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
How to give an apology

777
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
I'm so sorry that I bought to the b*******

778
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
That I thought that you were a gun store that was against the

779
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
The second f****** amend

780
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
Almost

781
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,808
Like that is almost like he's apologizing to a hype

782
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,624
Like that was very much

783
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Like

784
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Only real God

785
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Is

786
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,024
Is represented by you on this Earth

787
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
The trigger

788
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah I just feel that way

789
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
It's a limited shows

790
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
That like he is afraid of being out of the good graces

791
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
Of Gunn weirdos

792
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,663
If you will go out of his way to apologize for that adipose

793
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
2

794
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
I just like leaving it be

795
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
Means that someone

796
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
You can call

797
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
In the gun community

798
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Gun Shop

799
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Which great

800
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
This guy

801
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
Really really

802
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Rusty h

803
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,143
41 school shootings

804
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,759
Several

805
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,975
Confirms fluoride

806
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
This is interesting

807
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
So here

808
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
We have a doctor showing up on Alex

809
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
We can just assume

810
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
Right off the bat a couple of things what are they

811
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,671
Feel that we are going to be discussing obviously that's the first thing. A doctor

812
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:45,023
Peter Glidden has a degree in naturopathic which is not

813
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:50,655
Probably 30 times I seen correct

814
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
Get to a product that Alex makes money also

815
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
A very quick search of Peter Glenn

816
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,431
Quote member of the scientific Advisory board at youngevity

817
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
Does Alex's show at this point

818
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
Which I stress is run by a veterinarian

819
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Pretending to be human doctor

820
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Peter Glidden

821
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
Give me somebody who espouse

822
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
Purely dangerous idea

823
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
What is bitcoin

824
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
The chemotherapy doesn't work

825
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
It's just a scam by doctor

826
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
And make more money also

827
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Instead of

828
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
Medical doctors

829
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
You should use naturopathy and

830
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Clinical oncology Journal

831
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Your selected one line

832
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
That he uses

833
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
To make a document that says quote

834
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
The overall contribution of Curative and adjuvant cytotoxic

835
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Chemotherapy

836
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
25-year Survival on a doll

837
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
Was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia

838
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
2.1 /

839
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
USA

840
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Already concluded

841
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
The chemotherapy only works

842
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
People that use it on

843
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
Of course

844
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
People about this

845
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
The 2% number is 2% of

846
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
The total people diagnosed with cancer

847
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,735
Not 2% of the people who get chemo

848
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Just very different

849
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Statistically

850
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
A large number of people considered in that

851
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
So the 2.1% is in no way related to

852
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
The efficacy of chemo is

853
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
The Miskin misrepresentation of the

854
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
The study is in Port

855
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
The name of youngevity

856
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
And the real consequences someone believing him is it

857
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
I know the chemo isn't 100%

858
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
The sure thing

859
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
But I would love to

860
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Beyond

861
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Tangerine

862
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,271
Alternate alternative medicine is Olga

863
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
It's all good and well

864
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
And there's nothing wrong with studying natural cures

865
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Ailment

866
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Main Street Medical

867
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
3 months already

868
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,583
Huge problem is when you use your unfounded medicine

869
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Bulshit

870
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Bulshit

871
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,191
Primarily to attack

872
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Street Medical

873
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,287
This isn't trying to advance medical treatment

874
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
Concerned that patients are getting the appropriate care

875
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
It's a transparent attempt

876
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
The trick vulnerable people in

877
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
Money on you instead of doctors

878
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
That's

879
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
Owosso Peter Glidden also host

880
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
The show on The Gents

881
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Communication

882
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,439
That work

883
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,327
Is all doctor guys of all people that are making money off

884
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
That is awful to have

885
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Where what

886
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
Hundred percent

887
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,775
Get as many guns in his men people's hands

888
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Is possible

889
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
And at the same time

890
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,639
Remove as many doctors as you can from

891
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
We want to get you hurt and go to make sure you

892
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
You stay hurt

893
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015
It's deeply disturbing yeah that's

894
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
F***** up

895
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Does fluoride study buddy

896
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Alex has no idea what he's talking

897
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,743
But also part of the reason the Harvard

898
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,583
Became so prevalent is that larger platform

899
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
The infiltrator

900
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Bulshit artist

901
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
Who use their platform

902
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
The Harvard study

903
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Texas

904
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,407
IQ the researchers at Harvard didn't run any neutral

905
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,967
They merely review 27 already

906
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Missing studies

907
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
And discussed what they purported to have sound

908
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,855
Most of the studies analyzed were about 10 years old and

909
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
From China

910
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
The studies were looking at people living

911
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Villages in

912
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,231
China Mongolia and

913
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Natural fluoride levels

914
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
Play stressed not added for natural natural fluoride level

915
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
Holes in their drinking water was approximately

916
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,007
12 * 11 what is here

917
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,543
Oh I remember this one

918
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,687
I don't think anyone would dispute that even beneficial chemicals being taken in at that high of a rake

919
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Can be dangerous

920
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Information

921
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
They point to this meta-analysis of studies and

922
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,743
Flippantly declare Victory and pretend that the Harvard Harvard came out and admitted that they were right all along and that the fluoride

923
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,095
The researchers who did that meta-analysis

924
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,655
The studies were also very clear in their paper

925
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
The 27 studies

926
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Furious

927
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Regarding the sign

928
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Method

929
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,847
Some of them would probably not stand up to scrutiny if they were

930
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
Estimated to be published

931
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
On their own

932
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
But they exist Within

933
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
In the body of this

934
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
Subsequent Studies have found no link

935
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Fluoride

936
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Like you but it doesn't

937
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,903
The misrepresentation of that Harvard study it already taken

938
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
Please that wanted to believe the false

939
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Conclusion

940
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,767
So no amount of proof that that conclusion is wrong it's

941
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
And one of the biggest reasons

942
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
This narrative

943
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Because exact

944
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Luckily with Alex

945
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,215
Pointed out there was a Huffington Post headline

946
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,031
Quotes Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces

947
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Children's IQ

948
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
No however it wasn't written by anybody

949
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
Play Bang Bang Bang Bang

950
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,463
Yep a contributor blog post was written by Joseph Mercola

951
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,023
Who is an anti vaxxer

952
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Grifter

953
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
And has been for a really long time

954
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
Multiple times governments had to tell him to see

955
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
Making medical claims

956
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
Putting forth about products

957
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:19,615
She sold it in 2016 had to pay back over 5.3 million dollars to customers eat

958
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Defrauded

959
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Reduce their risk of cancer

960
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
He's a real pile of s***

961
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
Probably worth a whole episode

962
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,855
Some point or shows up on Infowars look forward to that

963
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
But for now just know Joseph

964
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
Nikola stock

965
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
People like him too

966
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
Do I have free reign

967
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
To attach them

968
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Information

969
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
Presumably legitimate name of their platform

970
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Even people like Alex

971
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
The mainstream media Outlets

972
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
What's have more rigorous editorial standards

973
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
He does

974
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,127
That's why he constantly backs up his stories by saying

975
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
It's in the main

976
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
News

977
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
He knows that

978
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Makes his b*******

979
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
It sound more believable

980
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
Because the Main Street news

981
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Does fact-checking

982
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,647
A contributor platform does not

983
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Expect.

984
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
So annoying

985
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,767
Such misinformation

986
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Stupid

987
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
Wow

988
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Pretty wild

989
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,655
Fluoride doesn't affect your IQ unless you

990
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
To take

991
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
It is a

992
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Severe disservice

993
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Science journalism

994
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,527
Not like intentionally

995
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,343
Just it's it's almost like there should be like

996
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
In the same way that their tops

997
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Clearance levels

998
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,719
Yeah something like that

999
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Should be under a clearance

1000
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
F****** abused

1001
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:48,703
Yeah but if you know of course

1002
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
Breeds its own problems

1003
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
That just can't be

1004
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,871
Allowed into the wrong hands

1005
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
Viscerally

1006
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
Gets out of bed

1007
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,855
It's so much easier

1008
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
Propagating

1009
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
People

1010
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
It's a more compelling enter

1011
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Interesting story

1012
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
The government is trying to

1013
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,583
To poison the water

1014
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Triggers your

1015
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Your brains desire

1016
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
And because of the intersect

1017
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Action between

1018
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
Journalism and science journalism

1019
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Especially

1020
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
Nobody wants to read a headline that are like

1021
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,991
Incremental benefits might occur based upon

1022
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,343
These controlled variables being applied in this specific

1023
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,695
Let's also not get into ideas about accusations

1024
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,071
Well poisoning Rich tradition

1025
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,399
From from history

1026
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Triggers that

1027
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
So dr. Glidden

1028
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Why am I calling him

1029
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Yeah they do that should be

1030
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,687
Mr. glitch

1031
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,735
Repeat

1032
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
Kemah

1033
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,999
Because he was calling himself a doctor

1034
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
That's not

1035
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
And I love the way

1036
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Describes this

1037
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Getting in trouble

1038
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
This is

1039
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
So off

1040
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
30-second little clip

1041
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
What does

1042
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
You first of all are amazing

1043
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Your delusion

1044
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
Second

1045
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Show

1046
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,535
Website

1047
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:08,735
Your help

1048
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Wow

1049
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
Cuz I don't know if I've ever heard again

1050
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:34,335
He heard the music come in and listen to Alex the show or maybe he does the same thing on his show

1051
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,831
Man that was smooth as silk in the state of Illinois charge me $5,000

1052
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,463
What what kind of Oppression are we living in

1053
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Free medical

1054
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,327
Because I can't just go to school

1055
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Free tuition

1056
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
That's what he was doing I mean

1057
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,543
I still a is also calling for

1058
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,871
You don't have to do homework

1059
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,455
Tuition-free degrees

1060
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Yeah that isn't Fortune

1061
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Joseph father

1062
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,047
I don't actually think that's true like if you're a d

1063
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
Diy things

1064
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
You call yourself a doctor

1065
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,263
Who's your wife

1066
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,567
You're right cuz you're not

1067
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
I think

1068
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,895
That this interview is Loki

1069
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
Super import

1070
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,223
It's one of the few times

1071
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
That I think

1072
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
It's totally not into

1073
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
To anybody outside of our world

1074
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,903
But to me this

1075
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Text clip

1076
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Is one of the biggest

1077
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
Case studies

1078
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
For like

1079
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,327
What could have happened if that people paid attention

1080
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Listen to Alex

1081
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
How could differ

1082
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
Currently could life have been

1083
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,679
If they actually paid at

1084
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,775
Play news crew

1085
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,527
ACL

1086
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575

Workout exercises

1088
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
6 months

1089
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,143
You better you better

1090
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:11,519
You can't

1091
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Would have gotten Alex

1092
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Find

1093
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
A very serious

1094
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
If anybody was playing

1095
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
Endorsements and testimonials are really in

1096
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,783
Things according to the law

1097
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,575
When you're advertising a Prada

1098
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
One of the more powerful ways

1099
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Discuss the ethics

1100
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,463
Vouch for it work personally

1101
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,023
I know this works because it works for me

1102
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
There are rules about how those are

1103
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
Pretty clear about how they can use

1104
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
And what are the chief guidelines

1105
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
Is there if you were expressing an endorsement

1106
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
You have to accurately Express

1107
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Their belief

1108
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,455
You have to represent them Act

1109
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,111
So it's a sin and robbed you don't believe youngevity products were responsible for their knee recovery

1110
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Alex just committed

1111
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:06,559
So they would have to under oath say yes absolutely I have a reasonable basis for believing that young

1112
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Help me

1113
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,655
Get my ACL B

1114
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Hold on

1115
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Furthermore

1116
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
Unsubstantiated claim

1117
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,103
Testimonial

1118
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
Cro-Magnon substantial

1119
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
Claims

1120
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,199
If youngevity is marketing by having Alex

1121
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
Talk about

1122
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,759
Instantiated misleading Medical

1123
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
They are still liable

1124
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
It's not like Alex said it's fine

1125
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
Not how it works

1126
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,207
Although

1127
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
Really f***** up

1128
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Because quote

1129
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
An advertisement

1130
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
Employing a dorsum

1131
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,655
Consumers about the performance of an advertised product or service

1132
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
Will be interpreted as representing the product

1133
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
The product or service

1134
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
Effective

1135
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Affected in the advertisement

1136
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,663
Therefore the advertiser must possess and rely upon

1137
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
Initiation

1138
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,247
Through including when appropriate,

1139
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
Reliable

1140
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Evidence

1141
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,087
To support such claims made through a door

1142
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,183
Advertiser would be required to be representation

1143
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
Because he used to testimonial

1144
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
I adore

1145
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,095
This is a medical claim

1146
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
Denise

1147
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Supported by evidence

1148
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Inexact

1149
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,727
Come out and said

1150
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,519
Product cures ACL tear

1151
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,055
Because Alex

1152
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Used to example

1153
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,127
Edit no point did they say something like

1154
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
These results are not typical

1155
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,199
Or something similar

1156
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,247
Disclaimer actively committed a crime

1157
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,807
Perhaps the most important for breach of a

1158
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
Luxardo is this

1159
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,927
They're from people with material connection

1160
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
Since to the company they're making claims about

1161
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:43,583
Infowars Nightly News director at youngevity is one of Infowars main sponsor

1162
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Resellers of youngevity products

1163
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,311
Rob do salary is in part subsidized by youngevity

1164
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
So his testimonial is

1165
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
No it is come

1166
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,919
Completely ethical when

1167
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
Goes to one of his own Golf Course

1168
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,063
Tweets out a lot of ads about his own Golf Course

1169
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
Sorry I pays all of our money

1170
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,695
To his own Golf Course

1171
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Just because

1172
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
Similarly

1173
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Impartial party

1174
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
Promoting a sponsor

1175
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
Additional

1176
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
Peter Glidden show

1177
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,079
As well as the show's of multiple other represented

1178
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
So precious metal Midas resources

1179
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
His company

1180
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
Youngevity

1181
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
He's deeply involved

1182
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
Depleted

1183
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,415
Pretty clear that use of these swords

1184
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
The testimonials

1185
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,719
Are an example of deceptive

1186
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Yes 104

1187
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Yeah you really didn't add me

1188
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
A lot of that legal languages

1189
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,935
Parsing very specific different

1190
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
Little tiny change

1191
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,799
This is a great table.

1192
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Understand

1193
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
Just like when you hear that if you

1194
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
You have no familiarity with the American legal system whatsoever yogurt

1195
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
It's fairly intuitive

1196
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:17,791
In terms of the guidelines are like you can't lie about what people indoors

1197
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,607
If you're f****** around if you

1198
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,143
Have a financial interest in

1199
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,935
The back your endorsement

1200
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,215
It makes a lot of fun

1201
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
I know this is beating a dead horse

1202
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Very sure

1203
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Alex Jones manifested

1204
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Multiple in

1205
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
Instances of behavior that are directly against

1206
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
The rules of the f

1207
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Is anyone cared about what he was due

1208
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
Gorp

1209
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
2013

1210
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
He could have been shut down

1211
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,343
Years ago

1212
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,135
For using this kind of deceptive

1213
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Possibly over

1214
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
Is it going to actually exist

1215
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
Give me flying f***

1216
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
About what Alex

1217
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,071
They could have had him

1218
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
I meant that he is

1219
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
Is actually

1220
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:05,407
Controlled opposition

1221
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:14,879
It couldn't just be that he's at this point in time irrelevant pointless and not worth anybody's time

1222
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:20,511
More and more trouble than it's worth to pay attention to him I can vouch for that that's why I adore smite

1223
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,631
Do you get one more clip here cuz the rest of the show also isn't there

1224
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,263
Cuz I think he wants to go to the

1225
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:36,639
Super Bowl Super Bowl overcompensate for how much he wants to watch the Super Bowl

1226
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
I don't get sidetracked by

1227
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
Udder excite

1228
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
Mexico see Piers Morgan

1229
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
And there's just not a lot of con

1230
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
Not much new stuff other than

1231
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Like I said the

1232
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
Power outage

1233
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Conspiracy

1234
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
I'm not interest

1235
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Frivolous

1236
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Frivolity

1237
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Frustrating

1238
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
But

1239
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
I told you

1240
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
What is up to VIP

1241
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,007
Youngevity on this episode

1242
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
Deeply and ethical

1243
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
Right

1244
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
Now Peter Glidden

1245
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
Would like you to know

1246
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
It's super app

1247
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,223
He's cool man

1248
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,927
Set up a f*****-up sky

1249
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:25,791
Sure I'm a board member of the youngevity

1250
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,071
But I'm

1251
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,887
Cool

1252
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Disclaimer

1253
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:38,591
There's nothing messed up about what we're doing

1254
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:44,735
Is really cool and if you were cool

1255
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,527
Dude f****** stuff he does

1256
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,183
By the way Alex

1257
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:59,583
30 doctor

1258
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,271
I love that I love that

1259
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,695
Yeah I was going to make your buddy spice by bulshit but everyone I know it's cuz they're not f******

1260
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
They're not f******

1261
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Pennsylvania

1262
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
That is

1263
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,447
That's next level like bullying

1264
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,751
As a as a Griff

1265
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
Sick of people saying I only

1266
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
We do this cuz I profit off of it

1267
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,383
My fiance profits off at

1268
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,431
We have a joint bank account

1269
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,735
I make withdrawals regularly

1270
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:54,367
Her money into my only account

1271
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
Cool

1272
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,255
And you do if you don't answer stupid

1273
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
It's crazy too

1274
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:05,375
First of all in talking about himself in the third person spot

1275
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,911
Makes me very uncomfortable

1276
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
But then the second thing

1277
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
If you really were listening

1278
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,591
Myself from the revenue stream

1279
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,639
What is a Visa legally

1280
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
Illegally

1281
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Myself

1282
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,551
I don't know

1283
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
Yeah time is it

1284
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
So you know you you get back in

1285
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,975
It's easy also these people are liars

1286
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,279
That is true

1287
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,583
Why would I don't drop it off vitamin

1288
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,447
I don't believe you you lied about everything else you tell people not to

1289
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,751
To get that because it's the conspiracy

1290
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,103
I don't trust you when you say you don't make money off your b*******

1291
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,223
What's the difference between you and me

1292
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Why the f*** is wrong

1293
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,391
I love the client you say that b*******

1294
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,183
If you're convinced by him not to get

1295
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,487
Chemo

1296
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,303
Of course you're going to believe that he's telling the truth

1297
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
It's on this one

1298
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Yeah yeah

1299
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:15,519
So shorter than normal

1300
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
Risen said there isn't a lot of

1301
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
You know stuff

1302
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,919
Go over it

1303
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
Loves Park

1304
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
I wish

1305
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,271
Yeah I wish I had more but

1306
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,623
Y'all can only I can only do that which Alex allows me to do

1307
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:34,463
Yeah we can't manufacture the footage that Alex

1308
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,583
Would have had videotape

1309
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,143
I think there's nothing funnier than Alex

1310
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
To be back on

1311
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,983
Salvinos Dad it was really exciting

1312
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
Beyonce does it

1313
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
Members of my family

1314
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
Community if you're not it

1315
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Because you're f*****

1316
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:00,319
Stupid it's so weird to me that Flex because

1317
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
It starts from a place of like

1318
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
I don't drop it off yet

1319
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
You don't expect

1320
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:06,975
Mediately

1321
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,047
Talk about all of his family profiting off of his life

1322
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,375
Indirectly at-bat

1323
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,471
Yeah it's so weird

1324
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
Are you

1325
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
If you don't

1326
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,247
Another episode

1327
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,599
Knowledge fight.com

1328
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,415
I'm at go to bed

1329
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,023
Podcast

1330
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:46,911
Sure.

1331
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
I don't know I think Peter Glidden

1332
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,895
Necessarily

1333
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
I guess second degree manslaughter

1334
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,015
I don't know I don't know how to ethically put that other than

1335
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
This a bad finger

1336
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:10,463
Piers Morgan before this

1337
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Vector

1338
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,071
Aboveboard

1339
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:21,471
I'm not at the first caller who was all about Molly yourself

1340
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,031
Probably has

1341
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,615
