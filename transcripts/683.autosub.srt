1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Sit around

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
But the author of saline and talk a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
Jones

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,912
Did we are damn door down

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
The end of the astronaut ice cream

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
I have to say I found a

11
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,552
Great astronaut ice cream exactly what you would want I may get some more of it

12
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
Imperfect astronaut ice cream this s***

13
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
Hits the spot ice cream

14
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
Took a picture of it cuz I ate it

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
It's not here anymore

16
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
And one of the things that I find really difficult about this is there does not appear to be a brand name on this

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,824
Another picture of a Rocket taking off on it

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Is a Neapolitan freeze dried ice cream sandwich and then a little smaller print it says space food

19
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
Space food

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
Yeah I don't know quit look

21
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,208
If you're looking for astronaut ice cream look for the one with a rocket

22
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Because I bet there are only there's only one of those

23
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,704
Rocket has really good almost worth it

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
For the whole week

25
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:23,872
Yeah yeah for sure cuz it get that spot of the like childhood memory was like back when this was like

26
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
The first time you

27
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712

I'm excited

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
Did you receive the summaries for everyone but it takes an issue

32
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680

33
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384

Oh my God

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
My bright spot is the

37
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
I

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
Finally have my own entry to add to the dreamy creamy summer

39
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952

Endorsement of cloud cookie

00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,152
Is an ice cream sandwich OSHA cream sandwich with two cookies

48
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Cookies by themselves

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
Are absurd and they're delicious

50
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
I thought it would be nice Cream Sandwich about yeah

51
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904

54
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,240
Wow you're not committed to the car it turns out that's what I that's what I'm learning

55
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
If you could finish that in one sitting you deserve a t-shirt of some sort

56
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
Deliver out to

57
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,064
I'm looking I'm looking at this

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
There are other website they have some some interesting cookies

59
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,327
You don't even know who know

60
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
3

61
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
Actual real God

62
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Roasted mushrooms

63
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Like toasted

64
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
Well here here's the situation mushroom marshmallows

65
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Are in real danger of this becoming first of all spawn Khan and second Us ending up like me

66
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Just looking at this menu

67
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,111
We are seemingly struggling on this way I'm going to get off call

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
I'm going to have to give that a shot

69
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Maybe next week will be

70
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Local

71
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Ice cream sandwiches I don't know we'll see okay I haven't even made it on Monday

72
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Another week's plan

73
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Kosher

74
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Today we have an episode to go over

75
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,199
We're going to be talking about May 16th 2022 that's Mondays show

76
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,087
We've seen last episode that we were going to check in with Alex's coverage of

77
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
The Buffalo shooting once he actually got into Studio because

78
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
On Sunday show the day after the shooting

79
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Pinky

80
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
And I was just there for a little bit

81
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
Cuz there was a big audience he just yelled about how he was right about everything

82
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
And then someone else has

83
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,663
And so I wanted to do this just to get the first episode of Alex's actually there

84
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Ultimately

85
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Kind of a little bit soft

86
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
In terms of

87
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
A lot of meat to get into

88
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
The most impact

89
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Actual thing I would have

90
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Like

91
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
2

92
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Present for the audio

93
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Here it is

94
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
As a document of Alex's day

95
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Definitely still some stuff

96
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
It's worth mining

97
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Yeah

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Put you on and this is something we're going to do someday

99
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
But we're going to get a deepfake

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Machine

101
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,087
And we're going to make a whole 20 Clips or whatever of a fake show that you've written in your mind

102
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Square Alex

103
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,463
Does the other direction absolute nice guy once once

104
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Progressive socialism for all

105
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
I think you can do it

106
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Central tragedy

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
We need to be

108
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
Consider tightening background checks

109
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759

I Googled it and it's a movie about a witch or some sort I'm not sure

116
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,735
Next Liberty must be watered by the blood of interdimensional demons

A little breaking for me

131
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
And then we're going to

132
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959

Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

143
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
And you never see me again

144
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
That's really what I want to do

145
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
I never want to come back here again

00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Here we are at the beginning of the show

190
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
A small sampling of our

191
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Total censorship

192
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
A form of martial law

193
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Here in America and gun confiscation

194
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
So this wasn't from the 6 minutes

195
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,743
What's that doesn't care on the radio that was a like John bowne report this is actual show

196
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
He starts

197
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
The show just the same thing

198
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,375
Depending on the day I sometimes have more or less

199
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,215
Patients at the start of the show I am feeling very low

200
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
On our last episode we covered Alex's Sunday show where he covered the Buffalo shooting by it mostly the

201
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Just fraudulently bragging about how he predicted it and then letting

202
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Someone else has the rest of

203
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
And that one Monday here he is back in studio on the first thing he does is brag about how he predicted the shooting and any place that same shity

204
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
Compilation that we discussed on the last episode

205
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
The bottom line is this

206
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Houston prediction

207
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
The shooting isn't being used to censor anyone

208
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
No one is using this to bring in martial law and no one planning to confiscate guns

209
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,983
This is a list of false premises but Alex is trying to use to build his reporting on

210
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
But ultimately because his foundation is so shity and full of lies whatever he has to say about this subject is really just a house

211
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Built on sand

212
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
It's really

213
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
Pointless what he's doing is pointless

214
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Yeah yeah I mean

215
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
Because that is

216
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Babe

217
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
For lack of a better word to that point

218
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
You know I

219
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
AV idea is

220
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Takis

221
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
This much

222
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
Attention away from

223
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
The problem as you can

224
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,143
Can't keys made people angry

225
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,239
Absolutely absolutely

226
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Just pushing all of the

227
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
These people into a corner with jangling keys

228
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
Yeah yeah it's but it's

229
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
The opposite of product

230
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
And I find it really annoying

231
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Yeah yeah absolutely

232
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
So here's a nightclub Alex announces a gas

233
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
What's coming on in Dubai

234
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Sean Stone filmmaker

235
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Author researcher honesty Oliver Stone Son

236
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
Smart Cookie in his own right

237
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
He is going to be in studio with us in

238
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Third hour

239
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
I had a Gerald Celente but I intend to take

240
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
50 phone calls herself

241
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
What's in the fourth segment

242
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Making calls

243
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
Search on Stones coming on the show and sent his dad Direct

244
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,927
Did Savages and we're not going to talk about that interview at all

245
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
That's a Dalek seems particularly focused on going to Kohl's on this episode

246
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
How to get some help with a

247
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Conspiracy talk

248
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Components from the caller

249
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
What are the parts of Alex's show the dolphin heart

250
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
To pick up on if you don't listen to a bunch of it

251
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
Collars us something

252
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Repeat that to the audience's Intel that he

253
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
Claim through gun from a high-level secret source

254
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
The next day

255
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
This happens if

256
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
There's a collaborative aspect on Alex's show

257
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
He sometimes needs the collars to help him Workshop this b*******

258
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:22,559
A lot of the time this is just the caller is repeating fake things that they saw to me more reading the right-wing blog headline

259
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,959
At the end of the day this work around really just accomplishes Alex not needed to do the minimal amount of work cuz it's normally

260
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
Only required to do this stupid show

261
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Just have all the audience read the blog

262
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,175
For him and not just that whenever it's a topic like this the advance

263
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
To having the audience

264
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
It's come up with your

265
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
Conspiracy narratives is that

266
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
You know you won't accidentally offended them

267
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
This is stuff

268
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
It's already

269
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
They're fine with because

270
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
They're the ones that gave it

271
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
Take a little bit of a temper

272
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
Where are the people who I need to abused

273
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,263
How callous can I be how how is this too far all of this stuff he can get from the audience without having

274
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
To take responsibility for it

275
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
And then when he comes in the next day

276
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
I know exactly what

277
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
I can and can't say

278
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
And if that is any part of his workflow if that's any part of

279
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Is Gage then

280
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,879
And I don't I don't know what he learned all the colors aren't great

281
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,023
So Alex Alex has a proclamation

282
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
If you read between the lines

283
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Is the

284
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
You are responsible for 7 billion

285
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Total planetary collapse

286
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,319
You will witness

287
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
You will wish to God later

288
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Don't stop what you're part of

289
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
You will wish

290
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
But you've been on the right side of History

291
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
I can't imagine

292
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
The Howe

293
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,407
You even get to a point where you can coherently argue that Alex is on the right side of any

294
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
By Briana Wilde

295
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
I mean I guess the conservative party

296
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
He's to the right of that

297
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:26,975
Oh oh yeah I guess ideologically is on the far right side that is true

298
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Okay there's nothing to that

299
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Of course

300
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,727
Speaks always have to be incredibly High

301
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,567
The world dying has to be the steak

302
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
That's been established

303
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
People are bored

304
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599
This isn't the future of the human races

305
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Hanging in the balance

306
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:00,511
I think logically he's really coming at this from the wrong angle because I don't see how I could

307
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Can wish I would have been on the other side

308
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Well you probably be dead

309
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
7 billion people died you're probably not going to have any regrets

310
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,639
Pointed out if all of us die it's like none of

311
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,527
Honestly I don't think either you or I have much survival potential

312
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
I'll put a jingle a hat on and I'll dance to make the people smile in the post-apocalypse a lot

313
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,559
Depictions of post-apocalyptic

314
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Jester's coming back actually do see some gestures are fairly considerable

315
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
There's usually a Jester character in every post-apocalyptic they also die

316
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Sex toys

317
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
You know like they're all the jester characters always

318
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,063
As I go through this I think I'm on the dead side

319
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
I think

320
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
They aren't going to cater to

321
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,255
To your medication

322
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
Securing that in a post-apocalyptic huge

323
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
I could be extremely useful for very short burst

324
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Extra

325
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,519
I've been very naughty.

326
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Alex

327
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
Thoughts about the Buffalo shooter and

328
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
I think this is not good

329
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Get to

330
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
How to get into this terrible

331
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Schizophrenia

332
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Operation

333
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Listen

334
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Mega stone avoid

335
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
I'm going to do that once I start taking your calls

336
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Not going to cover right now because

337
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Demon

338
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Whatever else went on

339
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,415
Yesterday the UN estimates that 450,000. 287 million

340
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
On the verge of starvation over 40 million in the numbers

341
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Six-month-old

342
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
An extra 40 million people last 2 years under

343
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
Million people

344
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,199
Something is really important to point out that Alex is saying that the shooter I had to

345
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
Schizophrenia that's not based on anything

346
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
She just using that word isn't

347
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Insult not as an actual description of a

348
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
The condition that someone may have

349
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Nope something

350
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
He's throwing the route

351
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Nope

352
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Also these numbers about few food in

353
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
Insecurity and starvation don't come out twice

354
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,679
To hear Alex is making that up so it sounds more official to the listeners but this is just the same stuff

355
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
He's been saying since the beginning

356
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
20 started caring about Hunger so he

357
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
You could use it as an anti lockdown talkingpoi

358
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
The number of people in the world to experience exude in

359
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Probably actually quite a bit higher than Alex's saying

360
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,111
With action against hunger they say quote as many as 811 million people worldwide go to bed

361
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,511
In November 2021 David Beasley the world food program executive director was going around

362
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
Making comments that they estimated the 45 million people

363
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
We're living on the edge of famine

364
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:22,495
And what aspect of this naturally is due to covid related issues but a bunch of it is

365
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,847
Regional conflicts are often a big piece of the puzzle and climate change

366
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Probably the biggest

367
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Just Factor

368
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Alex doesn't care about all the

369
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
But it's an effective performance for him to put on

370
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
When Alex should be talkin about white supremacy

371
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
Is mass shooter who shared a lot of his own ideology

372
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,511
The best way for him to sidestep that and pretend he's taking The High Ground is to get about half the shooting was bad but so many

373
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
People are dying from Hunger

374
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
And Alex's righteous for focusing on the right

375
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Thing

376
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
It's not righteous man

377
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
It scoured

378
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
And now it says no answers or even suggestions

379
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Do the question of world hunger

380
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
And if he had his way and Ron Paul was elected

381
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,943
So many more people would be starving in the world due to

382
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
Bcomplete abolishment of foreign aid

383
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Like he is

384
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Ridiculous

385
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
Cuz he has no

386
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Solution and actually

387
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
His policies

388
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Specifically wood

389
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Kill way more people

390
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
In the developed

391
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Open world full of s***

392
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Yep

393
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Know if if I'm murdered

394
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,215
Dan please make sure just do me one favor don't let the

395
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Person who murdered me

396
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
Come to my funeral and then s*** in my corpse

397
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Cuz that's what that tone of voice was

398
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
That was Alex shiting in my f****** mouth

399
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
It's well at mean

400
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Is a distraction

401
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
Jesus yeah yeah yeah

402
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
I mean that's

403
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
Him say it him saying those words man

404
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,559
Itzy iT'Z what about kind of

405
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
Nerf game with

406
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
With death

407
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
Yeah that is fragile

408
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,495
Especially when you're what you're really saying is

409
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
Oh man I wish I had the opportunity killed more people

410
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Innocence

411
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
He's on the right side of History

412
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Sure all these ideas he has are great

413
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
So

414
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
This is just

415
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Nonsense

416
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Alex is

417
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
Dead set on trying to push the idea that the

418
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,584
Hunger that's being spirits around the world is solely due to covid lockdown

419
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Million

420
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
How many

421
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Football stadium

422
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,200
Well yeah we got is a lockdown cuz you're couple million-dollar coverage so that

423
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Plan

424
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
We had the point

425
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
And I'm just sitting here

426
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Billionaires

427
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Top talk show hosts

428
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Brogan

429
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Alex

430
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
How do you tell the public

431
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Because the public

432
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
Handle the truth I go back to A Few Good Men

433
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Will come in next

434
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Famous

435
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Sing with

436
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Tom Cruise

437
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Open

438
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
We're getting pissed off and finally

439
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Well then those walls falling in

440
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
Because it's true for both

441
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
What are the whole system goes down

442
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,504
Hangouts got sidetracked thinking about A Few Good Men

443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
Sapiens book in the wrong side of the Few Good Men

444
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,464
Both sides of an apparently

445
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Yeah

446
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
I mean you know

447
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,192
Dry please talking about this this worldwide hunger stuff and then he really get sidetracked

448
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
Text by the image of

449
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
A Few Good Men

450
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Missouri gets into like

451
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
The dynamic of who is

452
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
This beep

453
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,432
And then he does actually when he comes back from break he plays that

454
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
I had to go

455
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Cuz that's what life

456
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
This guy loves movie

457
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Bloveslife

458
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,952
And life is moving some people save a Doug Benson Loves movies

459
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,840
Absolutely not

460
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:37,984
But has he turned them into real life is not so he still lives on the other side of moon

461
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
Doug's got to change his podcast Doug likes movies

462
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Love

463
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
Alex has something in his Mexico but I found

464
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Really confusing to sit with for a minute I think I

465
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Cody sings really f*****

466
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
It's important to understand that we're going from a system where we had

467
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
Horse owners proud of their horse

468
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
Sprawling cities in there

469
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Cruise ships in there

470
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Money

471
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
Saw the wealth of population

472
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Population was good

473
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Reversal of those ideas

474
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
You can pretend you're part of the power structure but you're not

475
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
And prosperity

476
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
To have that

477
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,016
Do a system that wants to implode the world economy

478
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,184
So I guess Alex thinks the Davis Group and the Vatican are the same

479
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Same thing which is a

480
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
So if I understand correctly

481
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
The old oligarch

482
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
They used to look at us as their toys

483
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
To be cherish

484
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,264
There's a condescending paternalism there Alex's describing

485
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,384
Another new oligarchs want to destroy their toys because they're no good anymore

486
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
I guess

487
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
It's sort of like the bad kid in Toy Story

488
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Right right

489
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,088
Everything's movies

490
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
So what point was that at

491
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
That the elites were good when were the elite sprout

492
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
Alex bewley tube in the Elites for a long time several thousand years right well the Rothschilds businesses go back

493
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Back to the 1700

494
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,056
John D Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1870

495
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,408
If you want to include the royal families of Europe is Alex often does

496
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,480
It goes back a bit further and it's a bit Messier

497
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,112
If you're including the Vatican now we're in real trouble of course all of it goes back to the devil

498
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
This is a problem for the idea of there being benevolent to Leetsdale point in the past

499
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Universe

500
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,888
How long this is been going Disick time

501
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,496
What movies were real I think at the end are you might get a glimpse of what Alex's dance

502
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Messing around

503
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
He's talking about this old version of the elite she wants

504
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,456
Stability prosperity in order any says quote they did some things that weren't perfect to have that

505
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,808
What exactly were those imperfect things Alex is talking to

506
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
Well I mean you know Pinochet did some stuff you know Chow chest you was a problem

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Things but they kept

508
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
The trains running on time

509
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
I think he's talking about slavery

510
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
Widespread rampit

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Discrimination

512
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
Those are the things that the elites

513
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,640
We're doing that weren't perfect were raping slaves that was

514
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Listen

515
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
It's not

516
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
But they kept

517
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Order

518
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
And that's what's important

519
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
I I can't I can't

520
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
Year that as anything else relay out

521
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,696
I do believe that his

522
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Black

523
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
Of clarity on what he's talkin about the

524
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
They did things that were perfect

525
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,400
It's just screams to me

526
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Yep

527
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
So this Clips truck might you're weird

528
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Talk about the world collapse

529
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
We should do about it

530
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
Magnifying

531
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
One woman

532
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
Grocery store

533
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
Shots fired

534
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Crazed

535
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Schizophrenic

536
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
They call the whites

537
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,144
Call them a white supremacist on yesterday's show

538
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Alex doesn't call him a white

539
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
Well you know that was In the Heat of the Moment he had not time to think about it now you don't know if he's a white supremacist or not

540
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
How would you know

541
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,016
You did yesterday actually after more information has come to light there's no way to prove it

542
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
I mean okay

543
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Okay

544
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Alright

545
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
Very weird

546
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,048
Very weird going for a white supremacist Monday Tuesday call him

547
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Well I think that's probably

548
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Cuz he got a

549
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Text from some white

550
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Friends who were like Hey listen

Spawn Alex anymore cover no kidding

554
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
So this

555
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
Rant is really weird but Alex gets into next

556
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
I think

557
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
Kind of understand a little bit of what he

558
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
He's trying to express but

559
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
We can't because

560
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,416
Is he did it would look really bad

561
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Type it all up

562
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Black-on-black in Chicago every year

563
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
You can't so much about Chicago

564
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
Kenosha

565
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
Because the system wants to guilt

566
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
White people

567
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
So here we are

568
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,416
Understand

569
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
Turn our borders destroying our food supply

570
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
Supply

571
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
With each other

572
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
I'mma tell

573
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
People Hispanic

574
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Blacksmith system one

575
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
If you don't

576
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
You're working for Satan

577
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
God is going to cut your ass off

578
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Brothers

579
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Brothers

580
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Accused

581
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Black people

582
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
And I refuse to buy in the leopards division

583
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Resume

584
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Come together

585
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,000
A little transphobic punch there at the end is a little bit unnecessary

586
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,072
Power doing a wrestling show

587
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Like

588
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
Three-quarters of the way through I would have

589
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,984
The best triple tag team in the world

590
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
Come in and just beat him with chairs

591
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
And then the crowd would lose their s***

592
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
I don't know depends on what territory around maybe so happy

593
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,784
So there's something really interesting about this clip here Alex is ranting about how he refuses to

594
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
To become races

595
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
It's interesting because he's already super races

596
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
What this reveals is

597
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
Kind of a weird thought

598
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,536
It seems to me that Alex thinks that the media is trying to make him braces

599
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
He feels like the me

600
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
Media is covering this instance of a white person who did a mass shooting but there's no coverage of crimes committed by black people

601
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
This is an intentional plot

602
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Too pushy

603
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
White identity button

604
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Then make him feel weird

605
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,152
There's no doubt that there is a problem of violence here in Chicago

606
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
But the root of it and the solutions are multi

607
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
The faceted and Alex is absolutely not into

608
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
To the matter at all and there is a lot of coverage

609
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Maybe

610
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,720
There's more coverage of it locally because a lot of it is a local issue

611
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,072
According to CBS news they didn't malisis of the FBI

612
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,912
Is crime data Chicago's the city with the highest murder rate

613
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
In the country but

614
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,312
We never really have questions about why the news isn't paying more attention to murders in Philadelphia

615
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Which is 16

616
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Or Kansas City which is 8

617
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
There's two reasons for that

618
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,784
The first is that generally murders in Kansas City or Philadelphia are considered local issue

619
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
And they don't make it to the national news unless there's some particular detail about the crime

620
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
That makes it stand out

621
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
4 coverage

622
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,560
In the case of Chicago people like Alex of gotten used to point of Iowa

623
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,120
To minimize whatever crime they need to deflect

624
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Attention from

625
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,984
Unless it becomes necessary that the murders that happened in Chicago should have

626
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Constant force

627
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
Front Page News

628
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Coverage all over

629
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Replaced mimetic

630
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
There is also a racist dog whistle aspect

631
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,736
Let's do this as well

632
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Chicago

633
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
There's definitely a bit of that.

634
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,648
It's baked in as well and that part of why it's a standard

635
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Right talking

636
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Point that the people have just gotten

637
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
Used to people like Alex

638
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Disappointing to

639
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
To minimize other murders that are inconvenient for them there's no way Alex new knows about the curfew that

640
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Like to put in

641
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Put on 14th

642
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Diorite possibly know that Lightfoot

643
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Just put up a curfew from

644
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,200
Shooting in Buffalo obviously we'll end up getting more media attention due to a bunch

645
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,760
Two factors that make it something to do is entities field

646
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Bonita cover

647
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
It was in a grocery

648
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,136
Restore the guy left a Manifesto it was live-streamed on Twitch

649
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
Clearly motivated by a racist ideology

650
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
These things tend to attract more attend

651
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
Dylann roof as well as other white supremacist Mass Shooters have pointed to their feelings that crimes committed by black people get caught

652
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,264
Alberta by the media while crimes committed by white people get a lot of attention

653
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
Is being a major factor in the radicalization

654
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
That makes total sense

655
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,432
That's because it's a white supremacist propaganda talking

656
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Appointment to radicalized

657
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,344
I went to only get this information from places that are essentially just repackage

658
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
The same kinds of talking points so

659
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Makes sense

660
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,000
He feels like someone was trying to make him more races

661
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
It's just it's not the media it

662
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
It's the media he chooses to consume

663
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
His media

664
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
Diet is full of things

665
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
Things that are meant to radicalize people towards of course he would be feel like he was being poor

666
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
To be racist

667
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
It is a common thought process

668
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
That unspoken

669
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
For people in this media sphere of just like

670
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
If these black people I've never met with stopped

671
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
Doing these things that they're not doing

672
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
I wouldn't be racist towards

673
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Not good

674
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
I feel like Alex has a

675
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Nonpoint there but if he

676
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Some soul-searching

677
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,008
He might be able to get to a little bit of the bottom of this maybe

678
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
Maybe there's something you could unravel in therapy because it's pretty transparent when he's talking about it on air

679
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Go to

680
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
You know

681
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Do you just can't

682
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
It's too late

683
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
It's just too late you know definitely

684
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Especially considering this mix

685
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
For these people

686
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
Anymore

687
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Situation

688
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
It's going to name check though

689
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
Is literally pushing the exact type of brake replacement narratives that motivated the buffalo

690
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
I mean that s*** that's that

691
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
That's crazy

692
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Outrageous

693
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
I mean even f******

694
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Tucker took

695
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
Least two days off from

696
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
Great replacement there now

697
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
I haven't checked but

698
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
He's waiting for the next mass shooting to take a little break

699
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
Either Alex has no idea what he's saying or he's going on his show and pretending he disagrees with the mass shooter by yelling about

700
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
That's something they agree on ferry Depot

701
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
I don't know I find this to be

702
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,512
Level of irresponsibility or

703
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,424
Recklessness or malicious unacceptable

704
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
Songs with our brothers and sisters

705
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,592
Beyond racial disparities are disagreements or anyting

706
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Now of course

707
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
We don't

708
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,784
Appreciate these types of the mass Shooters with their now I will read their Manifesto out loud to you and tell you how right it is

709
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,624
Obviously he didn't mean to do the things

710
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
But I told him he should do that I said it would because I split an infinitive means the media can't

711
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:23,680
Was motivated by the guy believing that there was a plan that the

712
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Globalist or putting into effect

713
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
And let me tell you the globalist

714
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
Do have that flyer

715
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,760
I just don't get human beings anymore man

716
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
Free Speech has a pretty woman

717
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,136
Yeah sure sure but this sucks

718
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
So here was a

719
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
Dreadfully revealing clip

720
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
This clip ism

721
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Embarrassing

722
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
After

723
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Doing this

724
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
I would quit

725
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
And

726
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
That's why I'm calling on

727
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
CEOs

728
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,128
Rebecca's the Buffalo mayor was giving a press

729
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,736
All the social media platforms to examine their policies

730
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,088
And to be able to look me in the eye and tell me that everything is being done

731
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
The big can

732
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
To make sure that this information has not spread

733
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,720
Identify

734
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,024
What information like this the second

735
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
Easley taken down

736
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
Fun with the manifesto

737
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Theories

738
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
That results in

739
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,520
The radicalization of a young person sitting in their house

740
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Is

741
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Barry

742
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
And it's something that has to be dealt with you have called it

743
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
Blame for what

744
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
First Amendment

745
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
Come shoot everybody

746
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Oklahoma

747
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Watch suspect is schizophrenic

748
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
Oklahoma

749
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Oh

750
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Get out

751
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,416
Is basically idea that the Buffalo shooter has

752
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Schizophrenia because

753
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
This headline is in his stack

754
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,560
Yeah and he doesn't realize that it's about a completely different person

755
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,704
This is an article about Jerry Varnell a 23 year old guy in Oklahoma City who is planning to bomb a bank

756
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
It's a completely different

757
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Situation Room 27

758
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
Shity work all around

759
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
I don't I don't know how you can do this

760
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
This poorly but

761
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
I guess Alex's

762
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,928
His response to reading headline and realizing that has Oklahoma

763
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
It also says

764
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Bomb

765
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,608
His responses like oh this is the right article I don't know they must have gotten the city wrong

766
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Are the state wrong

767
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,216
It's it's nonsense this is so bad

768
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Yeah I'm terms of

769
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
Quality of information that's being disseminated

770
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
Listeners really should

771
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
Wake the f****** yeah man that's like a clip that just

772
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Steve like

773
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
You want to play and then just sit

774
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
In the silence

775
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
It's done and just like

776
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Really absorb

777
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
All of the evil

778
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,536
There was that clip of Rogan that was going around in real-time realizing that he was

779
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
Cover story

780
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
Like kind of disappointed when he realizes that it's fake

781
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,360
And that's the same sort of moment that Alex is having but

782
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
He's not

783
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,944
Willing to be like oh I got the story wrong

784
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,992
At the end there when he's there's

785
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
Pause music

786
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
I don't know why it says Oklahoma

787
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
That's the same sort of revelatory moments

788
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,208
But Alex is too much of a liar

789
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Do own up to like

790
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Like bye-bye with

791
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
If this one

792
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,656
I mean I think the thing about the Rogan

793
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Spot that just

794
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
It it just lays bare

795
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
The the

796
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
The feeling

797
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
That's important

798
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Twozies peep

799
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,432
It has nothing to do with what everything says it doesn't have anything to do with ideology

800
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,992
Was believe what they like

801
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,088
And what their keep chasing is that good feeling of reading a headline and going

802
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
Oh man I'm so right about the world

803
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
I'm so right

804
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,536
Yeah that bet there's an emotionally satisfying aspect to it that is

805
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
Deflated when you realize that

806
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
Most of your headlines are based on bulshit

807
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
Yeah you do you know I am right

808
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,056
About headlines an awful lot

809
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
Has not once made me feel good

810
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,736
Not once you need to change do you know why cuz I'm only right whenever it's the worst thing possible happen

811
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
You should start

812
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
Becoming a

813
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
Agnostic

814
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,160
That's like it's Gerald Celente

815
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952
Aaron's forecast

816
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
To the right wing and then

817
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,864
Just lie about everything better

818
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Suspend a line but everything

819
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Superchips

820
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,176
I blame him but I blame more

821
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
Beyond the state police and others

822
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Nothing was done

823
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Pizza shooting

824
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
What does it do anything

825
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
Nothing in their clip was true

826
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
All of that was made of

827
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,104
All of the information that Alex is conveying to his audience

828
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Is

829
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Incorrect

830
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:59,551
He's basic theories on completely incorrect information and at the same time disseminating the great route

831
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
Play Summit style conspiracy theories

832
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
And presenting them as fat

833
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,951
I mean it's just

834
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,535
Need to be opposite way it's not even useless

835
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
It snapped its destructive

836
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah I know I mean this is

837
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,727
IMEI see no other conclusion to draw from this other than

838
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
Alex is encouraging the next

839
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Mass shooter

840
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
Whether consciously or not I mean like there is yeah Thursday

841
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
There's a dynamic

842
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
Especially considering how good he

843
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
He's feeling right now

844
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,319
You know more mass shootings means I keep feeling good

845
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Bigger audience

846
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,671
I don't know if you heard about the

847
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,023
But it was gotten some pictures were going around on social media that someone used a plane

848
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
And wrote Infowars in the sky and Alex's pretty excited about that

849
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
You should also

850
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Recognize that Alex says

851
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
Like to take time to talk

852
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,335
About himself

853
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Your phone calls

854
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Directions

855
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
The great folks

856
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
I do not want

857
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
So we're not in

858
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
Credit for that we really appreciate

859
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,399
Find work because

860
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
Has become the maxim of

861
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
I don't believe in him

862
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
How you really feel

863
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Piss in your Cheerios

864
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
Alex Jones

865
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
What are you doing

866
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
We salute

867
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Everyone out there

868
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
That is doing

869
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
I care about this guy riding stunts

870
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:48,607
But the notion is a useful meme for him is

871
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
I really think is

872
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,727
That's why when he does these compilation

873
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Of his predictions

874
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
I feel like it's very important

875
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
To take the time

876
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,127
To deconstruct why he's not right

877
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
About the things

878
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,455
That he claims he has protected

879
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
Dangerous meme

880
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,135
Because much in the same way you're talkin about these headlines being emotionally satisfying

881
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,975
There is a charge that people can get out of like

882
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,047
This this feeling that they're in on

883
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
Some sort of like

884
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,911
It's a secret information this information

885
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
MMA

886
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
That

887
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
The Alex Jones is right idea

888
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
Is a gateway into that

889
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,175
Gateway into experiencing that artificial

890
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
Dopamine Rush

891
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
And it's

892
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,551
A kid it can get people on that path

893
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
Dangerously I mean

894
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
That's one of the reasons that I I don't think

895
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
Human beings can use the internet but

896
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
It's not just that one

897
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
Burst of dopamine

898
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:56,447
There's also the likes you get from tweeting it out you know ocean I just got 30 like I only get four likes normal

899
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,263
Oh f*** I'm so popular now on top

900
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,335
That that the more engagement you have with that content

901
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
The more likely you are to get put into the algorithm

902
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
There's an X

903
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Initial amount

904
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
Of attack that happens the moment you share

905
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
One f****** Alex Jones

906
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,367
I don't I don't know if

907
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
I don't know

908
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:22,047
It's automatic but I do think

909
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Probably

910
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
There will be

911
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,935
Reroute some validation

912
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
That you get from people who have the same ideas and

913
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,823
Yeah I I just caution

914
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
People about this

915
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
And it's it something that I'm taking I feel like

916
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Should be taking a bit more seriously

917
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,063
Absolutely than a lot of other like do you like

918
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,951
CNN is Isis

919
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Reporters at risk

920
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
Ryan what have you but I don't think

921
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
Is much like potential in terms of

922
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Bringing people back

923
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Text to Alex

924
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,495
Where is the

925
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
Meme I think

926
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Is

927
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Something

928
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
That

929
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
Is Pope

930
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
In terms of that

931
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
I I feel I feel the obligation

932
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Push back

933
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
I mean you know the ultimately

934
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
Anything your enemy does that make

935
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
Makes them feel good you should not engage in

936
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
And help them feel good like just Alex

937
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
Being his name on the Internet

938
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
A lot

939
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Makes me feel good

940
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,143
Right he's my enemy I'm not going to insist that

941
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Terrible

942
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
True

943
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
So

944
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Alex

945
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,407
Is basing a lot of his coverage of the Buffalo shooting on fake

946
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,855
This is very very sad

947
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
The system knows that

948
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,023
That this guy was planning to do this and they let him do it that's come out in the news

949
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,095
This is just the Bedrock

950
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Of his

951
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
This was a orchestrated shooting

952
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Kind of talk

953
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
Based on

954
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,591
Just complete nonsense in a misrepresentation of new stories

955
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,711
Also interesting to call like the history of slavery in the ramifications of its some historic beefs

956
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
Have you

957
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
Have you noticed

958
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
And I'm gonna throw this out there

959
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,695
Have you noticed that one of their memes is that the media covers up black crime and only focuses on

960
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
White crime

961
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
And also

962
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,047
Anytime you talk about American history they go listen

963
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
Stuff happened but let's not worry about it right

964
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
Do you notice that the babies are extra on what they want to focus on

965
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,639
I'm at out there maybe they're the ones babe I'm just saying that if I cracy might be a thing that they're engaging

966
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
I know

967
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
I know it's crazy

968
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
So Alex does get two calls

969
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
I mean they have some theories

970
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,343
About this shooting

971
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Not good

972
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
Controlled walk up to a woman

973
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Quiet

974
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,583
Shoot a woman load groceries

975
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Loading groceries in the car

976
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
Imagine

977
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
Demon possession this creature was under

978
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,543
So I just imagined murdering people all the time

979
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
To me I don't even see it enough

980
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
Time for somebody to get that evil

981
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
That's how evil the times all right now

982
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
What is life

983
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
And he could just go out I mean

984
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
It is

985
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
My controller

986
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Took the shot

987
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
You know I mean

988
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,399
Italian man

989
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
Control that he was under

990
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
I have heard him rattle off so many

991
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,639
Stick f*****-up murder fantasies fantasies lot of them

992
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
Like unbelievable

993
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
Numbers of murders

994
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Grotesque

995
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Graphic

996
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,039
Description of like choking

997
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,671
Wolf Blitzer adapter blood everywhere on the answers Got Talent

998
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Yeah Alex

999
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
Yeah you know exactly how that f*****

1000
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
I

1001
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Yeah

1002
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
And I think that we've also a gauged with

1003
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,191
So many of the people that he claims were mine

1004
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
Controlled view over the course of this

1005
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
The show that like

1006
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,895
That just brings so Hollow to man it's it's just a refuge for him

1007
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,247
There's nothing to say mind-controlled shootings

1008
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Worked

1009
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
Why are they

1010
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Why are they still doing

1011
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Well

1012
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
So Alex another caller you also believes that there's my

1013
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
My controller a foot

1014
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
Yesterday when I was seeing those news reports

1015
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
Trying to pay attention in

1016
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,447
I just got this anger over me you know I just

1017
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,567
Why are they releasing their MKUltra on us

1018
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
What they're doing

1019
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Children Network

1020
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Obese children

1021
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:00,319
MK Ultra

1022
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
And now they're handing them guns and they're releasing them

1023
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
I don't think it's as responsible as a way to engage with the

1024
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
The Scholar

1025
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
I think that there's some

1026
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,287
Accuse that you can get that maybe this person is coming from

1027
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
From a place of like

1028
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Real real

1029
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Sucked up conspiracy ideas

1030
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Alex's

1031
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
Massaging them

1032
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
You bet your totals right

1033
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:37,695
I mean it's 2022 and they're in she's arguing that MKUltra is behind all of

1034
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
And Alex

1035
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Instead of going like

1036
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
Mam MKUltra you know

1037
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,423
Alex Heller you just gone like Hey listen

1038
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Great

1039
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:55,103
Assassin's right right

1040
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Current

1041
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,247
This is a little bit really depressing

1042
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,367
And everything old is new again and Alex does actually

1043
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Sort of

1044
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,927
Skedaddle cuz I think

1045
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,231
Did you finally get super powers like that too much

1046
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
Try to warn people

1047
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
I don't have any family because

1048
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,679
You know what the cancer and all the others

1049
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
And my husband he thinks

1050
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,615
He thinks I'm going crazy and I'm telling him that he has to

1051
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Do something funny

1052
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
Say something

1053
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Something

1054
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,599
The line is drawn into staying and we're all going to have to either group together

1055
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
Squishies people out because

1056
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
Demons demons

1057
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
Appreciate your call

1058
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,887
Burrata

1059
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,703
Is this Earth cuts her off at home

1060
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Because she saying the same stuff out

1061
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
It sounds really bad

1062
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
Sounds real crazy

1063
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,895
Yeah it sounds really really upsetting

1064
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,711
I'm coming from a caller

1065
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Control

1066
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
The presentation of things and

1067
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
I just

1068
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
If there's such a

1069
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Like

1070
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
An interesting

1071
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Difference

1072
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,303
When you see like the same ideas being presented by someone who's

1073
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,375
Clearly a bit Manic and a little bit

1074
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Like

1075
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,775
Autophone Express

1076
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
I think it really reveals what

1077
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,711
Like the reality of the ideas Alex's Express

1078
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Not good

1079
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:43,903
Well I mean you hear back at you like that and you go boy this lady does

1080
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:50,815
Oh wait the elites are demons and I we got to get together and

1081
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:57,215
Offer

1082
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,775
Save that

1083
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
It's all about tone

1084
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
You know a lot of it is about

1085
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Ty really is

1086
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,967
The ability to move along

1087
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,271
Move Along

1088
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,599
Or shift into a commercial

1089
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
So Alex

1090
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Pixlr call

1091
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,791

1092
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
And he has some

1093
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Complaints about Trump

1094
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,167
A real quick before I get when I want to talk

1095
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
Second Amendment

1099
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,359
One gray commenting on it

1100
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
Some people were

1101
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Stop it

Position

1105
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
When he

1106
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
The economy down

1107
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111

Kiss of quarters we got bamboozled

1111
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151

And now he runs again

1115
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
My big point

1116
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
Dealing with

1117
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
The situation

1118
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Would Joe Biden the new world

1119
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
I mean like

1120
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,727
Realistically with this collar is expressing whether he wants to admit it or not

1121
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,055
Is Alex you lied to us and

1122
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
You

1123
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
Let's

1124
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Let's take a pic Alex

1125
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
Either you lied to us

1126
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
Which you have insinuated on

1127
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
On the show in the past

1128
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,087
Or your instincts were so bad that

1129
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
You let us

1130
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Into

1131
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
Following

1132
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
This Judas goat

1133
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
Is Alex would put it

1134
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,303
So are your control that position sure

1135
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,631
These are options but what's not adoption is

1136
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
You have good instincts

1137
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
Sprite and your support of trump was

1138
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
Call look back on as a good thing

1139
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,871
Response to that is like I got someplace about Trump

1140
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Let's ride let's not talk about that

1141
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,479
Where in the Bible in season

1142
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,759
Yeah

1143
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
That's that's

1144
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,319
Two-year that's old news

1145
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
Did Bill Clinton got out of office today

1146
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,559
You know it's more about W Baker the clintons entirely

1147
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,143
Alex still thinks Obama's in charge of everything

1148
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,519
This is nonsense he just is so afraid to take responsibility for the b******* that he push

1149
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
And his audience know a lot of it has

1150
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Moved on from Trump

1151
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Or has

1152
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Right you do realize the Trump isn't

1153
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,503
The person that they were told he was supposed to be

1154
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,319
He doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions

1155
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,623
In the course of the last five year

1156
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
No I mean piece of s***

1157
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,767
I think this is one of those times where

1158
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Feel

1159
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
Terrible

1160
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,167
For conservatives in general because they're their power is based upon

1161
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,215
Non-stop constant aggrievement

1162
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
And because of that

1163
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
They can never

1164
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
Appreciate a win

1165
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,151
You know and they can never appreciate somebody who brought them away like

1166
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,527
They don't love Mitch McConnell and yet Mitch McConnell gave them everything they've ever wanted

1167
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,599
And they hate and I mean obviously

1168
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
I think

1169
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
That

1170
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
Even with

1171
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
Their opposition to vaccines

1172
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,583
Goods and bads in terms of being able to

1173
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,887
Lot of social

1174
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
And

1175
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,959
And the ones who got it got to live

1176
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,031
Like it or not like whatever

1177
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,847
Do you know complaints you have her picadillos about Trump

1178
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
3 Supreme Court Justices

1179
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Like this

1180
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,015
Get the f*** out of here with you ever wanted a

1181
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
And you're still complaining which is why I feel bad for you and also why I hate you till the end

1182
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,999
End of the Earth

1183
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
You know there's a lot of

1184
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
Agreement obviously is very profitable

1185
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,519
41 and then second it's kind of has the same dynamic as like even when you win the election has to be stolen

1186
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,359
In order to make sure if you lose an election

1187
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
It's also

1188
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,943
There is still kind of that

1189
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,343
You can never be happy because I stole this extreme swing to the right that is been facilitated by

1190
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,135
People like McConnell and Trump

1191
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
Yeah it is

1192
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
Kind of milquetoast

1193
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,487
It's a little bit light

1194
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,839
Even Stevens

1195
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,911
You can sort of Justified

1196
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
Right

1197
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:21,311
Yeah we'll be we'll be excited for covid lockdowns whenever DeSantis makes it illegal to protest

1198
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Anywhere

1199
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,919
Three-piece baby

1200
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Love it

1201
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
Conservative love it to they're the ones who loved it.

1202
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
The most they can't get enough

1203
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
Yeah one last clue

1204
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Honestly

1205
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
I mean we didn't write a policy of no stone family members extractor Rodger but he's not related

1206
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:46,143
Oliver Stone on the podcast

1207
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,727
Ripple effect

1208
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,311
Forever

1209
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
It was his dad who made the movie the sins of the father Gossip Girl

1210
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
She's gone forever

1211
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,527
Never seen

1212
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,063
Episode

1213
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
It's right he was the one

1214
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
Yeah

1215
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
I think

1216
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,207
I don't I don't know enough about Gossip Girl

1217
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,511
Partner watched it either

1218
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
CIA

1219
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,911
There's there's just a lot I mean a good bit of the show is just

1220
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,239
Bragging about having called compilation again

1221
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
You know there's

1222
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,103
Got a ton of freshmen

1223
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Material

1224
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
And

1225
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
This is what you

1226
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,271
Galaxy brain

1227
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,575
You know sometimes we can

1228
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:42,975
You talk about him having a repetitive show and all that stuff but on a show like this where what is repetitive

1229
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Is so f******

1230
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
Disgusting

1231
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
Vomit right around an hour

1232
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,703
That's the way we do it till so everybody survived

1233
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:58,847
We were going to check in on this on our Wednesday episode and so I felt like we had kind of a need to do that

1234
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:03,455
And it is kind of repetitive and kind of tri-tip

1235
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Can meaningless

1236
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,527
But at the same time there is like

1237
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,063
A couple things that I think

1238
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,207
We're definitely like relevant like the fact that he is reporting on a 2017

1239
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,279
Story about an Oklahoma bombing suspect

1240
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
Thinking it's about

1241
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
This present situation

1242
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,887
That is so revealing of his

1243
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,311
Obstinately thinking it's about the present situation in defiance of all available now

1244
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,919
How there used to be order

1245
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:40,319
Pushing of great replacement ideas wow covering this story

1246
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:45,183
And then the other thing is like a glimpse into the mentality of his audience

1247
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
It's through these collars

1248
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
And I think

1249
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
There is a

1250
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
A troubling view here

1251
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
I mean the words Beyond Redemption come to mind

1252
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,239
Just scary to

1253
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
Tooth like

1254
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
Think of

1255
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
People just

1256
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
Legitimately thinking there's

1257
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Everybody's banking

1258
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,199
Control

1259
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,759
And she that lady's married

1260
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:15,903
Her husband is I don't even know what's going on there

1261
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,463
I don't know how you could stay

1262
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Somebody

1263
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
It's like

1264
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,839
You need to write an email to the president right now too

1265
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Stop

1266
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
MK Ultra

1267
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
I mean I guess I would just probably say like

1268
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:33,823
Sure what do you want for dinner

1269
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,359
Well I do your makeup look

1270
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
I think

1271
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,783
Have a certain point you're going to be in the situation with your partner

1272
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,623
Relationship

1273
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
The difficult

1274
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
Sometimes

1275
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:54,303
You believe in reality I don't we'll meet in the middle who do reality

1276
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Blaze one last clip

1277
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,631
And the caller

1278
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Supposedly wants

1279
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
To talk about farming

1280
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
Shut up

1281
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,359
Farming is a solution

1282
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Party brother

1298
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Dot-com with

1299
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,415
5 airplanes

1300
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,743
Across the city

1301
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:00,607
At 25000 ft Alex Jones was right

1302
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
Yeah he got the message

1303
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
Message on that

1304
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,983
Really understood what that caller was talking about her

1305
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,311
I think is Brian

1306
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
Like military airplane airplanes

1307
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:17,759
Moving on Degrees of Separation

1308
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
From Eddie topic

1309
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:25,695
But again I didn't hate this recognition and the part of the collar of the with a

1310
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
See if the Alex Jones was right meme

1311
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
Being able to

1312
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
Spread and sort of

1313
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
Trick people into thinking

1314
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
About things

1315
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,935
You know I mean

1316
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,983
I don't want to be that guy

1317
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
Who says

1318
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Military coup

1319
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Historically

1320
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Not going well

1321
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,943
What I'm going to be is the guy who says

1322
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
You can look at

1323
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
Current

1324
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,831
Military coups happening at various stages of happening

1325
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:59,231
And have happened watch them in real-time like we haven't been dead time machine

1326
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
Where you can watch this coup happened

1327
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,351
Myanmar is a little bit further on and they're cool

1328
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,239
All of this s*** is going on

1329
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,031
But people here like listen

1330
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,127
You got to get the military ball but none of these coups have someone

1331
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
Like Alex involved who's a prophet

1332
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
None of them are led by a psychic

1333
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,183
I would like to see Alex on a horse with like a military helping

1334
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
That would be fine

1335
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,767
Give me on a horse

1336
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:41,215
Back when the elites were benevolent people ride horses

1337
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,519
Get that far away through through

1338
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,127
Yeah I guess a little bit of a shorter episode a little bit

1339
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
Knox

1340
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,503
Immediate maybe as I would like but but Alex

1341
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,295
Dad brings

1342
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,647
Filler I don't have a whole lot to work with

1343
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Dinner

1344
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,791
People love our longer episodes enjoy longer episodes

1345
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,863
And in certain circumstances I think

1346
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,471
That we went by which I mean you have done an excellent job of

1347
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
Keeping certain episodes

1348
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
Mercifully short

1349
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:20,383
Well thank you all going I have a hunch

1350
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,455
Because a good possibility that our Monday episode might be wrong

1351
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
60

1352
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,295
We'll make up for it see what happens

1353
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
Anyway, I will be back

1354
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Jordan but until then

1355
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,023
Play website

1356
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
Almost

1357
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:54,175
But dull then I'm Neo I'm Leo dcx dark I hope you all have a wonderful dreamy creamy summer

1358
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
The sex robot

1359
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Alex

1360
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
Kristen color
