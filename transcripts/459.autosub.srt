00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

David Bowie absolute

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,056
Haha

8
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
I just noticed that I have

9
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Couch

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
I build this this couch that I ordered

11
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
I noticed they wanted the back pieces was broke

12
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,728
I was trying to install an actually stabbed myself in between

13
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Papercut

14
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
Tablet

15
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,296
Couch has no good how many people out there but stabbed by couches

16
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Stab back out

17
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
I needed to get a replacement part for it

18
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Obviously

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
I ordered this couch from Wayfair

20
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
I should say that I ordered it book

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
4

22
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
This was I can confirm it was ordered

23
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
Turns out there was a child inside of that couch on the couch

24
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
Before these conspiracy started going around and

25
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,488
Hope it doesn't delay the couch furniture

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Kman

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Terrible customer service

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,824
And I called the Wayfair customer service people and of course because of stuff

29
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,920
There was a delay for a good 25 minutes or so

30
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
What is soon as I started talking

31
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Did somebody eat the guy was like I am so sorry that's the girl we can do rest another park to me

32
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
Without me asking

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
20% off the couch

34
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,376
The best customer service experience

35
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
I can't I

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Hey if you sell kids you sell kid but I'm going to be a great customer service

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Theories are true and exact

38
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,176
I think it Wayfair might be my favorite company

39
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
I had to deal with

40
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Small companies

41
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
I really had to deal with customer service with

42
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
But they were above and beyond

43
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Let's figure out

44
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,120
Illinois

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Decided

46
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
That I'm just

47
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,848
Go for it

48
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
Probably Flexeril question to ask but

49
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,296
Kohl's about that conspiracy stuff

50
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
Askreddit

51
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
Do you know where was very diplomatic

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
Saying something wrong

53
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
You got to be

54
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Sort of delicate

55
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
I will say that I have gotten

56
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
What how much of a bumper

57
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Selling it as job

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Treated me as a customer

59
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Sowell

60
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Still have to deal with

61
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
Like people calling in and making accusation

62
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
Make some fake conspiracy theories

63
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Make those people have to deal with life

64
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Comcast

65
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,279
Absolutely probably sells children will die

66
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
Why they're all named so stupidly that I have with that is people who are answering those

67
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Don't deserve that

68
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
Like to have people calling accuse them and yell at them but stuff

69
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
It's not their fault other people to call Snyder's fault

70
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
I don't want I don't want it to be directed towards them at all Universal basic income

71
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
After you get what you deserve no no no no.

72
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
I was dealing with customer

73
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,255
Surprisingly

74
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
Considering

75
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
How about you very nice things

76
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Condolence

78
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
I'm sorry

79
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
That was back

80
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
Back Friday morning so that's that's all

81
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
At least

82
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Complete

83
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
So that is what is thank you to everybody who isn't very nice

84
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Empire

85
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,351

86
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Yes your answer

87

Listener Mary Catherine

88
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
That's a very nice

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
That's very very nice

90
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,207
So sorry that you had quite a weekend

91
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,047
Families Rustin don't do it don't do it

92
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
See I'm coming just to be I'm coming around on the other side of it I'm starting to actually like my family a bit more

93
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
As I grow slightly healthier

94
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
But I certainly understand the situation

95
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
That you're good dude

96
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Describing

97
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Clapping

98
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Yeah

99
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
It was necessary for your sake on Friday

100
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Have another episode

101
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Much fun without you

102
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,959
I'm just you know if you're if you're going through something

103
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Sometime that's all it takes

104
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
I am great

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
I don't know what to tell you. Is there nothing to tell me that stone is tossed and round

106
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,975
Open today

107
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Fireworks

108
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
So here's the thing this is not going to help

109
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
Alex

110
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
What is today

111
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
You gone out Sunday yet

112
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
David Knight Alex called

113
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Tomorrow thinking well this would be great for their Wednesday episode that's not how we record Alex I mean I don't know what's going on

114
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
But it's

115
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,599
Really suspicious playing breaks around us but

116
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Okay

117
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,255
How many area that we had to take some pretty short notice

118
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Very short about Alex's

119
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Monday Sunday Monday Tuesday

120
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
What's 3

121
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
A month ago

122
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
We had to take some little time off

123
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
Listening we might be the only people listening

124
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
What's the point of him doing his show

125
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
If he doesn't look I'm not going to do a stand-up show 20 people

126
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
People in the audience knowledge hecklers

127
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,399
Immeasurably take the ark formally elevated very slightly

128
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
I don't know I don't know what to say

129
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
I'm starting to like

130
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,823
If I was a little bit nuttier I would really be

131
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,783
I'm not that into ascribing important

132
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
Selling a cabinet named Emery

133
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Oh

134
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,743
I don't know

135
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,263
Do you last one he did before you last July 7th

136
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055

Anderson

138
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
The more you said

139
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
The year has gotten

140
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,087
Yeah maybe there is something to I should probably stop at

141
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Fortunate

142
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Ignorant

143
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
I hope not

144
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
I certainly hope not

145
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Comes to be

146
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Then I need to get back

147
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,655
Into mindfulness meditation

148
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
Alright well anyway we're going to go to episode

149
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
And it's

150
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Stupid

151
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
And at the end

152
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Gets really really inappropriate and very f***** up

153
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
Anyway that I probably normally wouldn't cover because they're honestly

154
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
I don't know what to do with it

155
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
This situation anymore

156
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
That I generally are on the side of not cover

157
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
I don't know what to do anymore I don't know I still have

158
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
A little bit of an uncertain

159
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Exactly how to deal with things

160
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
How to treat him as a media entity

161
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Like like

162
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
Constantly pushing him to the Forefront in having him on his show

163
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
I don't know how I give a free pass

164
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
I don't know how

165
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,647
I don't I don't know if you would like 15

166
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
100-percent ignore

167
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
I would absolutely

168
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Ostensibly in adults

169
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,799
I don't know what to do anyway we'll talk about that

170
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,151
Thanks Kevin

171
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,503

00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
To the audience

192
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
I unfortunately

193
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Due to

194
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Carelessness

195
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Sloppiness

196
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Lack of rigidity in my work

197
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Workflow

198
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
I lost

199
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
A

200
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Human Arc

201
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
So that we recorded

202
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
It was about 2 hours long

203
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
Pissed off that I lost it because

204
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,863
We told the story of how we met I discussed a lot of stuff about my

205
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
In hip-hop when I was younger

206
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,031
Exhausted encyclopedic details about anticon records

207
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
All sorts of nonsense

208
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Yeah and then also

209
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
We did a taste-testing of Peggy's vegan Hospital

210
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,135
And we had such a revelatory you realize that you love

211
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
I love I love every one of those hot dogs and I was fine you thought that you couldn't handle them but we had we had

212
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Really hot

213
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
Versions of Scouts and you were just fine and enjoying it

214
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
I thought that was great and then also avocado

215
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
I can't find the audio

216
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,319
Be able to find it one day that I have

217
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Don't know where it is

218
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Don't look

219
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Dab Izakaya

220
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Possible that it's somewhere

221
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
But I can't Bank on that

222
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,167
And I feel really bad about that because I really would have loved to share that with the listener

223
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,031
But there's a second reason and that is because there were a bunch of shout outs for listeners

224
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Owners on it

225
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
And I didn't

226
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Keep

227
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,223
A record of the names that we shouted out on that

228
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Female robots

229
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
So here's what I want to say

230
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,927
We are behind on shoutouts and we're working to get

231
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Closer to Curran

232
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,119
Unfortunately one of those ways was

233
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
There was that

234
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
We have

235
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
Some plans to be able to get closer to current

236
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Because of losing the Steven A episode

237
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
I do not know

238
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Some names

239
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Let me try.

240
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
So if you were listening

241
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
And you haven't heard your name

242
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
Guys shout it out

243
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
Before May 15th

244
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Please send an email to Nala try to gmail.com

245
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
And I'll expedite it to the front of the row

246
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Make sure that make everything right

247
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,775
I'm not good at need to get better I need to rest

248
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
The world the rest of the podcasting world is just like

249
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Thanks everyone for donut

250
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,759
That's what they say that's what they do a shot ourselves in the foot before you ever

251
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
I like playing drops of Alexei funny things

252
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Android

253
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
That

254
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Respect

255
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,103
Please

00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Free cam and

257
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
We'll try to do that of course

258
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Now Jordan

259
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
I do think

260
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
You you mention

261
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
This earlier

262
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
And I do think it is

263
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
And that is over the weekend

264
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Maybe

265
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,071
Exactly what they was over the weekend

266
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
RadioShack

267
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
Rodger

268
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,639
Pretending

269
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
A person

270
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Right

271
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Yes

272
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
What happened

273
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
He'll reach the phone of Rochester

274
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Why don't I

275
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
If you would like to be rats

276
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Please leave your name at the end of the beach

277
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
I did

278
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
Is the Oak and one of the terrifying

279
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Assertive reality

280
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
The joke is

281
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Is this would be great

282
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Qdoba

283
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
The reality is like

284
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
This

285
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Is

286
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Indicative

287
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Like

288
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Casual

289
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
Flippin use of these sorts of

290
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
You know like hey you know anybody can pretend like not a hard-r or something important

291
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,695
But you know why you're sitting there you didn't say I don't want to argue with this guy

292
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
You you said you Rodger said that word for a reason

293
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
I don't know why you had Rodger Stone on your show

294
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Other than to say

295
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
What he did

296
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Everybody got

297
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
It's all bulshit

298
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,015
I was so mad that people I don't know why you have Rodger

299
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah I think I think it's not necessarily the best

300
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
I can see why he is of

301
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
In terms of the news

302
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,351
You're allowed to get a little comp

303
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Rotational

304
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
I don't I don't know if it's the worst

305
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,543
Cinemaworld I don't know why you don't like I don't know what you expect to get out of it

306
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
Like also look what question was that

307
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Why would you bother answering a question that you already know the answer to Rodger Stone indicted why would you ask

308
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
Rodger Stone has been on a please Trump I have been your friend I will do anything for you give

309
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Give me a pardon or a commutation

310
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
For a long time and then he got it

311
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,607
Course he got it cuz he's his friend

312
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
That would make Rodger have to be like

313
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,543
Well I think this was just as being up we all know

314
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
He got it yeah but I think that's why

315
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,759
Smoking a little bit

316
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,599
Rodger saying to someone who speaks can't be her.

317
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,927
I don't want to argue with this

318
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
For both parties involved

319
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
What is somebody going to think differently of Rodger Stone

320
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Yeah

321
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
I understand

322
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
I think it's shocking because of the casualties

323
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Rodger

324
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
Offensive language

325
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
I think it's

326
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
This world

327
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
You're free you have to at this point

328
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
How do you not feel like you're untouchable

329
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,312
You can't change anybody's opinion of you and you literally cannot go to jail

330
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
State charging

331
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384

Cover Ben Alex because of who got their account

There's a good guy than

360
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
Would try and fake more than Jeff Bezos

361
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Give money away

362
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
Alex's take on this will end up being like he was a good guy letting them know they've got all of their GM

363
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
Yeah they've got a little bit more later we'll talk about it then

00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176

Episode

370
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Is

371
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
Not good

372
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
It's really

373
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Job

374
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,608
It's not like drunk he doesn't appear to be high or anything like that just like

375
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Something off about him

376
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
And I don't know what it is

377
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
And it just turned me the f*** off

378
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
To be rough

379
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
So much unfolding

380
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Time

381
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
That we are all in our

382
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Is

383
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
People

384
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Are ready

385
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
To hear

386
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
The truth

387
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
America

388
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
Global Consortium

389
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Literally trying to make

390
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Forever

391
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
Do you really want

392
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
You again

393
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Associate

394
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
You would want

395
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
Almost no one is going to get more power

396
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
They're doing it

397
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Empower

398
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
Investments in around system because

399
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
They are slaves

400
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Operation

401
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
The police think about visiting infowarsstore.com

402
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Christmas in July sale

403
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
What the f***

404
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,296
So I don't I don't know

405
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
Chicago rhythm

406
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
About his

407
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Way of being

408
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
Call Michelle I can't even

409
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Messerli setting something up or

410
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
Anyting

411
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,448
I just don't know what's going on there's there's something there was a Feeling

412
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
It made me uncomfortable

413
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
But make what makes

414
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Is it out to the gas

415
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
Pretty early on

416
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Millennial Millie

417
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Millie Weaver

418
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,784
Rainbow snacks okay here we go

419
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
I don't know if

420
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,000
Her investigation into the sunshine movement is born fruit yet Sunshine movement

421
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
Jeezy I don't even forgotten

422
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
You don't even remember I didn't remember him

423
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,080
The entire server and they were

424
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Through it

425
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
Talk about it a tiny bit if she still got a mole

426
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
The inside

427
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
I don't know I don't know what's going on

428
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
Come on out to the show and really break down any specific

429
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,024
I don't know what's going on I'm going to guess it's nothing

430
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
So far

431
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,960
If she's dropping Michelle's and they still haven't figured out who the mole

432
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Either bizarre Bob shows

433
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
There is no Bowl

434
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Or some type of I don't care

435
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
They probably don't

436
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
I would say all three

437
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,272
He's really dumb and here's one of those

438
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,136
They talked about also Alex is that they actually believe

439
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
That covid-19

440
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
Is a result of climate change

441
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
So they include that in their eyes part

442
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
Climate Justice

443
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Covid-19

444
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
The climate change caused it we've got to make

445
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
They also say the covid-19

446
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
He's going to teach us to lower our carbon footprint

447
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,992
Demille's talking about climate

448
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,184
Rainbow snake

449
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Secretly a radical

450
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,584
If you get selected climate change

451
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
I want to force you to use different light bulbs

452
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
There's something very stupid and very difficult to listen

453
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,592
I pulled out that clip though because I felt like it really well capture the insincerity and lack of curiosity in the right wing

454
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Particularly

455
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,736
Anointed themselves as the people in the world are responsible for conveying information

456
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
If we're to believe rainbow snatch

457
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
She saw some Democrats

458
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
Connecting climate change to covid-19

459
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
And her response to that

460
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
Exploring any further

461
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
Remember condescending as to give the audience the permission to reject the idea as well

462
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Without doing any further analysis

463
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
What kind of idiot would say that the weather effects

464
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
Viruses

465
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,896
A week ago I said that when it gets hot viruses don't work anymore

466
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
So what's the

467
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,600
The person who is taking on the job of disseminating information

468
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,232
Something I feel like it's their job to actually understand the topics

469
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
I would do anything

470
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
Match could not explain why can I covid-19 climate change

471
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
And I would further back than

472
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,008
Never even crossed your mind that you should look into it for the stuffing

473
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,616
The connection decided it was Libera lunacy and moved on

474
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
If you cared about the reality she could have learned something by actually engaging with material and reading up on the subject which is actually really important

475
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
This topic

476
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
In terms of the future of the planet

477
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
If you wanted a nice boil down to the topics you could have read propublica's piece from May 7th titled how climb

478
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Climate change is contributing to skyrocketing rates of infection

479
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Just disease

480
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,216
The number one threat to humans in terms of unknown and undiscovered in Texas

481
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
These are animals

482
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
The live in habitats

483
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,616
Wild and remote places Out Of Reach of human

484
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
Under ideal circumstances the animals

485
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Like certain

486
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Bats that carry diseases in humans

487
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
Contact with most of them

488
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
Under normal circumstances

489
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,208
Very small risks

490
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
People

491
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Human host whatever they're carrying

492
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,656
However there are a couple Trends have been happening as things that make the world we live in not ideal

493
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,008
The first is they were engaging in massive deforestation around the world seek

494
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Make money

495
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,200
The second is climate change making previous habitats inhospitable to animals causing them

496
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
To move like to seek out new sources of water and food or just

497
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,624
The living

498
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,696
Sometimes because of these moves

499
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
These two forces combined to increase the chances that infectious diseases will be in closer proximity

500
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Human settlement

501
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Also increase the likelihood of them inspecting a person in Kazakh

502
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
This is a very real

503
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Concern

504
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,664
It's not even the entirety the concern from climate change

505
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
Propublica article

506
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,064
Roughly 60% of new pathogens come from animals

507
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
Including those pressure by diversity lost

508
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
Can be directly attributed to change

509
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
The introduction of farming

510
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
Development or resource extraction and otherwise

511
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Natural settings

512
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,264
Vector-borne diseases those carried by insects like mosquitoes and ticks and transferred in the blood

513
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
Precipitation

514
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Vulnerable

515
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,528
Climate is even bringing old viruses back from the dead

516
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
Zombie Contagion

517
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
Like the anthrax released from Frozen reindeer in 26

518
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
Which came down from the Arctic

519
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Contest from the past

520
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,328
Awesome new idea the people just tried it out because of covid-19

521
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
You can easily find a retrospective study in the journal environment

522
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
International from January 2016 which

523
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,824
Discusses me history of scholarly literature on the connection between climate change

524
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Human infections

525
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Diseases

526
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
If you read even a little bit of the information on the subject it honestly starts to become laughable that anyone would think it would be possible for

527
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Climate changes

528
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
Not affect infectious disease

529
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Princeton

530
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
Why is there certain seasons for diseases

531
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,608
If the seasons shift a little bit

532
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Is just like

533
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
General vibe

534
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,984
Right right

535
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,056
It's a sort of like you know I just know

536
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
They would have let

537
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Rudolph playing those f****** reindeer gay

538
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
And instead they all got that's what happens that's the story they don't want you to tell

539
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,208
Oh no

540
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Jesus

541
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Like you could have The Wallflowers guide my sleigh

542
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Exact one headlight

543
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
That I'd like rainbow snatch to think about

544
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,104
Pathogen needs a certain temperature range

545
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
I survived

546
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Second

547
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
Jamaica has shifted precipitation

548
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
Which reflects the dissemination of water-borne package

549
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
Pathogens of Airborne infectious

550
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,720
Diseases such as influenza tend to be responsive to humidity conditions

551
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:08,352
For example absolute humidity and temperature were found to affect influenza virus Transmission in survival

552
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
The factors related to

553
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
The climate on and on

554
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
In terms of infectious diseases

555
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
It's a very large

556
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,664
I know I know that you

557
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Of course

558
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,016
She's mocking this idea

559
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,648
Lauren treating it like oh you don't understand

560
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
You must not understand

561
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
Otherwise

562
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Wheatley

563
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:43,168
Completely blindsided by the idea that we live in a global ecos

564
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,264
One thing even though you think it's on one button

565
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
You think is unrelated

566
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
Every other but

567
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Compressed actually sets off a

568
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Chain reaction of button presses

569
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
Leading to consequences that you cannot understand

570
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Unless you I don't know

571
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Dedicate your life to studying

572
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,416
It seems to me for this to be true

573
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,000
You learn to be true or this like mocking of this connection to be true

574
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,840
She must like taking issue with all germ Theory

575
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
More or less

576
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
Complete denial of

577
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Germ Theory

578
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Very weird

579
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,088
In terms of Public Health

580
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
Rainbow snatch wants to come on

581
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,256
Find it kind of difficult

582
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
When I say that these people like me

583
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,032
When they encounter an idea that seems like a problem for their work

584
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
The immediately decide the ideas liberal nonsense and then make up their own story about it that's not good work

585
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
That's why when Alex arachis decided to

586
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
That's what all the people

587
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:14,560
Does not surprise me every interview

588
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
One of his major credit

589
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Former Infowars

590
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Rodger Stone

591
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:37,344
Position

592
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,184
Kind of silly if you're like we're having former Infowars house Rodger Stone

593
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
Yeah every single introduction

594
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,376
For every interview shooting clued about a guy

595
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,472
On Infowars

596
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,824
Anything other than

597
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Slinging pile of s***

598
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,992
So anyway talk a little bit more about stupid things

599
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
And that

600
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Alex doesn't want Trump to do a virtual

601
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Convention because

602
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
He's strong

603
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,584
Now the Democrats are going to do a virtual convention

604
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
Theory about why

605
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,728
What do you think should happen to the convention try to make everything virtual

606
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
He should have his convention

607
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Trump needs to push forward as

608
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Abnormally push forward

609
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Creating all this

610
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Is there trying to hide the fact

611
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Joe Biden doesn't have

612
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Support

613
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
It would help for him to have

614
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Fading

615
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Issues from a strokes and whatever else

616
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Know that his policy

617
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
These are going to call. They know that Trump is going to

618
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
The person to layout

619
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Just how bad

620
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
By Joe Biden is in

621
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Avoid that

622
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,664
Does Millie think there's going to be a presidential debate at the Democratic Convention

623
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,064
What does she think of regular convention would require of Bloodsport

624
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Does not

625
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
He's just bitter and then he talks

626
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,744
He hasn't Vanquish everything under in debate

627
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
We don't choose at night for one section of the DNC and then the other ending after Jocelyn Joe Biden

628
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Will Jackson

629
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
Democratic National debate

630
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
With all the p

631
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
People who already agree with it

632
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,248
He's one of the f****** nomination

633
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
What's going to happen everybody if they were there there don't ye give a good speech

634
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
Obama's net worth

635
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
There is something to be said before

636
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Of people who would be protesting

637
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,568
There will be some people on the last Democratic Convention

638
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,712
The issue there isn't not trying to avoid that by not having a

639
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
Convention like you could you could do

640
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Ye there's that

641
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Right there is a

642
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
It's really about not being able to

643
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Debates

644
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:28,096
DNC in the RNC happened at the same time

645
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
You have to talk to the other one like

646
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
It's like a giant game

647
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:39,360
I honestly don't know I don't know what

648
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,712
Yeah there's going to have him on camera so you didn't have to debate people

649
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
Or hide his support because

650
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,856
Even if he's even if he doesn't have as much support sure

651
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
He can fill out a 10,000

652
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,744
If you're talking about

653
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
It is this is in the context of

654
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
Trump and Biden debate

655
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
I mean I'll listen

656
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,032
I don't know what they would do digital virtual

657
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Debate I don't know

658
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,128
If that's the conversation then all right

659
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
What are you talkin about

660
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Conventions

661
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
I don't know what you're talkin

662
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
Cannot imagine a reason for Adam

663
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
I cannot think of any reason

664
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
To get the two of them to talk

665
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
Seems it seems unlikely they are going to sway anybody

666
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Silly

667
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,912
What if they debated we're all just going to watch it and be like can we vote for not America anymore I don't know what to vote for

668
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
Yeah I don't I mean

669
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
In terms of tradition and there's always debates you know

670
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
Out there should be debate

671
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Sometime

672
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
But in this one circumstance

673
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Specifically there's no point

674
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
I don't know if I have an opinion on it

675
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
I think

676
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
You know there's a lot of people who

677
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
I think it's important to have those debates and I can understand where they're coming from

678
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,488
I think you are very valid point

679
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
I think I think I think

680
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
I would say that there's not many undecided

681
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,496
Well you know

682
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,896
I guess Trump is basically committing second-degree murder every single day and every time

683
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
But I really want to know what

684
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Is Nutella

685
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Explain is going to be

686
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,576
And I won't decide until I compare it with what

687
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Hayden says his tax

688
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,136
Let's see

689
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
I don't know

690
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,864
Vitamins questions for you is the president killing people

691
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
Yes next

692
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Trump

693
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
What is ru

694
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
What is

695
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
Executive branch

696
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
Cuz if a question

697
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,480
The nasty question not a real question

698
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,296
So Alex has decided that the Twitter hack

699
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
Is

700
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
The good guys

701
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
Taking over parts

702
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
Twitter

703
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Google

704
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
Recaptured by USF

705
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Google.

706
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Smelly

707
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Alright whatever man

708
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
This is a fun

709
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,696
Spy novel you're writing Alex but I don't

710
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
In terms of

711
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
I don't think anyone's going to publish this out

712
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Did the British Elsa recapture

713
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,704
Fort Sumter

714
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Recapture

715
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,384
I love the idea to that it's only part of Google

716
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Don't have any hands in YouTube

717
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
That's a whole different department.

718
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Video game playlist open-world video games

719
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
Another rest of it you still left

720
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
Turnover

721
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
There's a guy sitting in the government

722
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
We are disappearing people slowly

723
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
So I can actually say for sure

724
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
Don't know if I don't know what's going to happen this evening will be wrong tomorrow

725
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
This doesn't happen

726
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
What is your view on Trump the election with 108 Days album

727
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
What do you think

728
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Well

729
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
I'm going to be careful Highway

730
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
I say this

731
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
There may or may not

732
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
Joint for stars

733
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Having some problems

734
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,351
On Tuesday pertaining to the New York Times

735
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
So as far as what's coming next

736
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
That seems to be in

737
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Pestana

738
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
I had of the calls for Acuna

739
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Francois pinault

740
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Is doing his best

741
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
To get it done

742
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Pick a lane

743
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,775
How many 4-star generals do you think are active right now

744
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
88

745
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,711
Is only eight four star generals

746
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
She realizes this rainbow smashed B

747
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
All of them have made ranked in trumps

748
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
Furman president

I don't know I don't know

751
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
What she's talking about

752
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
You're obviously Tuesday's not over

753
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
So I don't know what's going to happen possibility

754
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,103
But they seem to be really excited about the idea of

755
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,663
Trump crushing all dissent Within

756
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,647
I don't know 30 days before the mainstream gop's like we should cancel the election

757
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,463
Like I'm not it's going to be a mainstream thought

758
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Not having enough

759
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Well it could be brutal

760
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:56,191
We haven't talked to her but

761
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
Thera-Band

762
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Fifty or so

763
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
Great bellingcat East a little bit

764
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Is just right on your real good primer

765
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,695
Breakdown of the logo

766
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Perspective

767
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
What's actually going on

768
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
From a local

769
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
Prospective somebody who's been there

770
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
I watched a lot of

771
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,751
Who has been streaming

772
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,311
And taking in a good

773
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,407
Last episode I was saying that I don't have a real good sense

774
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
What's going on

775
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
Kind of

776
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:48,671
I surprised myself and had the time we recorded a lot of resources

777
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,255
Peoples but I mean I'm in Chicago I don't really

778
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,583
I think that there's only so much of a perspective that you can

779
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Can get without

780
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
You're not on the

781
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,727
Right

782
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
It's a story to be very difficult

783
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
God to cover especially as it's still a

784
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
Activities going on

785
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Because of the death

786
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
Really hard for us to talk about

787
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
The precise

788
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,063
Things that were going on with the autonomous

789
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
I don't know

790
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
You kind of have to

791
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Find

792
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Some

793
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Resources you can trust

794
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Go from there

795
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
And so

796
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
We'll talk about it a little bit

797
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
Because

798
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
And I will say that his perspective

799
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
It's great I love military secret police don't want the feds to come in and take my property

800
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
After seeing the video today

801
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
Sender one

802
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Who's in charge of those officers

803
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
San Quinn

804
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
Richmond in to Portland with no accountability

805
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Quick question

806
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
About the physical safety and

807
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Civil liberties

808
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Peaceful protesters

809
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Our shortest

810
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
We won't

811
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,263
Federal police actions here

812
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Start the shower with that

813
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
What's going on there just

814
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
Last night

815
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
You a hamster

816
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,647
By the Democrats

817
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Plans that we received

818
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
From

819
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
Inside their criminal operation

820
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Soundtrack

821
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,631
Ontrac come on man

822
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Federal buildings and other structures

823
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
So we'll talk about the specifics a little bit more

824
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,663
Resource Alex ever trots out

825
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,479
That's stupid fake Soros antifa contract

826
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
Harrison Smith found on 4chan

827
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
A couple years back

828
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Is Hope

829
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,439
Ask document is behind so much of his argument

830
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
If you actually

831
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
Take a step back

832
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,583
My files and I realized that I'd actually taken

833
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,399
Screenshots of all the pages

834
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
Time that I couldn't rely on Alex

835
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:13,567
Keep them up on his website like I did get exposed

836
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,127
Copies I had them I reread them

837
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
F****** hilarious

838
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:22,527
I remembered that they were funny in terms of the idea of their existence but man it's so silly

839
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
For one thing

840
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
If you go to the section autoproved practices

841
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
It says quote

842
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
Contact

843
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Da Donnelly

844
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,535
Do not name this individual at the end

845
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Start stopwatch

846
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
Do not use AllCast do not name this individual in any columns or

847
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,455
Person of course not not leave this document

848
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:58,623
Hillary person then why I asked

849
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
F****** put it in a contract people Planning Center

850
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
If you think someone would do that you probably watch too many movies has pages in the 9/11 report

851
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
Was like the salaries did

852
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:18,847
Do you remember those how they didn't reject those at all

853
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Quote

854
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,951
Closed fist to maybe use only below the neck and above the belt

855
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
That's just

856
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,303
What

857
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,703
Wow it's Marquess of Queensberry rules of kicking is not permitted

858
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
Provoked with no other recourse

859
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
I had to keep it

860
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,943
I didn't know you had my eyes

861
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Get the guy got to let Daddy

862
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
We're not going to keep you on

863
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,975
So these documents are embarrassing an obvious fake but I started looking into it a little more

864
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,327
According to a recent article in Reuters these documents

865
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,399
On social media claiming that they were founded

866
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Floyd related protest

867
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
B some antifa member had dropped them

868
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,847
This is how things are primary sources involved in conspiracy

869
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,431
Over and over and over

870
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Because people are gullible

871
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,503
If you need citations on that

872
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,807
Look into the protocol

873
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Anyway

874
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,415
There's mad hilarity that can be found in this writer's article

875
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:43,071
For the longest time Alex has been saying that these documents are between antique and George Soros his son Alexander

876
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,887
Because that's the only

877
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,471
In reality the document claims to be from Friends of DeMar

878
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Chrissy

879
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,127
Which is a pact that was founded by Jonathan Soros

880
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Whoops

881
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
Although these forged documents appeared online in 2018

882
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,295
15

883
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,623
In the aftermath in unrest protesting surrounding

884
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,695
The killing of Freddie gray in April of that year

885
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
Now here's the problem

886
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
What's wrong

887
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,327
Friends of democracy didn't exist in 2050

888
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,911
Says who secretly exist

889
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,751
A year earlier it's been reorganized at Edwards

890
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:28,639
Pretty backpacks in 2014 with another group called the public

891
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
Organizations name is every voice

892
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,111
They're specifically group focused on promoting the candidacies our folks are running for office

893
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
That's adorable

894
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:45,791
At the time these contract were supposed to have been made the shadowy evil Soros company that is said to be involved

895
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Even exist

896
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
This is very sad

897
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,727
Levels of fraudulent you going on here that Alex is trying to prevent is real

898
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:58,079
Do you see what I'm saying about a debate what is the point of debating with people who believe

899
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
This s*** is

900
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:05,247
Real what are you going to say stuff

901
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:10,111
Joe Biden laughing at the honor the sacred honor of loti the present

902
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
I think you do

903
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,023
Individuals or believe in this

904
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
Something when you just like

905
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,447
It's not something is it isn't

906
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
Doesn't mean anything negative about you

907
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
It's not like

908
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,591
You know you shouldn't feel ashamed

909
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
Nearest if you like

910
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,951
I think the laughing at the idea of

911
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
With everybody

912
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,703
You shouldn't mock them cuz that's kind of cruel idea of

913
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,007
Stupid

914
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Unreal

915
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,591
You can almost feel the desperation and now it's though

916
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
This guy who you love

917
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,455
Does it help to get elected is the guy who's doing

918
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,271
Baptism Tire careers

919
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,623
And the only way how it could make anything other than

920
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Like he's just

921
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
Become a sellout for a dictator

922
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
Is if he has this contract

923
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Zapproved

924
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Enemies

925
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,863
What is dear leader is using to justify his Crackdown her actual

926
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,911
What is fake

927
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
And Alex is a sellout for

928
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Dictator

929
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,383
He is this is really this is really Grim I mean

930
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
Going on in Portland Visa Avi federal law enforcement very in line with a lot of

931
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,903
Insane I was thinking about this

932
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,975
Just like this is part of the

933
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,791
Mesa Road where Lake

934
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Mike Knox

935
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,119
You lying about everything

936
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,959
Federal law enforcement being used

937
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Forlorn

938
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,567
My purposes domestically is something

939
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
It's been a joke

940
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,175
Concept

941
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
It's the same thing that I think about

942
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
FEMA camps

943
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
Vietnam

944
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:20,927
Yeah but it is based on you know a lot of steers that surrounded rex-84

945
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,047
A plan to round up leftist

946
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,607
Communist and immigrants

947
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,423
And Union organizers

948
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,215
Things like that

949
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,591
It's not like it's that far that you can turn and look at it

950
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,175
You know like as far as as far as the

951
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,967
Legitimate fear of being put into a

952
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,343
You know you can see if governments do do it right

953
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
It it some

954
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,975
Stop

955
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,815
Yes Alex you were always yelling about like Jade Helm and all that nonsense

956
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,119
You know you cried wolf many times

957
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
You never really mad what you were saying anyway

958
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
Mail

959
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,287
You made your career plan

960
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
Being there

961
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
John

962
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,663
And you're on the side of the people you always warned about

963
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
That's

964
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
Pretty sad

965
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,063
It's pretty sad and

966
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,463
Or live long enough to give up everything that you've ever believed and only she'll pills

967
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,559
Man

968
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
We got dementia

969
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
With Majestic pill news

970
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
Run around

971
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Is putting people in

972
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,599
These these reports

973
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
Corroborate

974
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,695
Conversation

975
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
About

976
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,767
The other goings-on in Portland

977
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
Cuz it's fine

978
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,471
Open doors with crowbar

979
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
The Federal Building

980
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
Federal Building

981
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,759
King of the federal courthouse so they can try to load it

982
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,695
Secret police are disappearing people know

983
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
You're breaking into a federal building

984
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,303
Leaving aside that Alex's

985
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
Completely like certain

986
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,423
Missing the point just missing the larger issues about what's going on in Portland

987
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,263
I want to take a moment to bask in the

988
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
That he's using

989
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,591
Are federal law enforcement

990
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,199
Capacities in the United States

991
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,599
Obama was going to launch a Posse Comitatus FEMA camps

992
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,671
That was his primary brand for years

993
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,743
Absolutely

994
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,559
Matching people up in Portland what's Alex's response

995
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:13,215
Super Kennedy Federal Building the Federal

996
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,263
Building ever

997
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,823
The people were being detained by unidentified age

998
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,687
They were trying to break into a federal building at the time

999
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
Exist

1000
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:30,623
If I'm not much mistaken I was a huge fan of Wildlife Refuge

1001
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
2016 obviously a state wildlife refuge

1002
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,095
To get into the parking lot by the federal government

1003
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:45,215
But if she was going to pop up in the case of the Bundys to on the fridge

1004
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,663
Kim Possible music

1005
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Where's the prince

1006
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:01,855
Differently

1007
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,183
Federal agents trying to text

1008
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
I remember that

1009
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,071
Where things get messy is that Alex isn't covering actual story in Portland

1010
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,935
Partially because he doesn't care because he sees the Optics

1011
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959
So he's using the

1012
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,263
The story the same way he was at every protest

1013
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,639
Find some clips of someone wearing a black mask doing something to look scary to old people in the suburbs

1014
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,199
Pretend exist in a vacuum use that perception

1015
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,271
When did justify whatever police violence has used on the protesters

1016
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
And move on

1017
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,855
This is not a case of out-of-control lashes

1018
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,415
Just trying to take over Federal Courthouse to Luna.

1019
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
Is Alex's presenting

1020
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:42,303
If you want a great explanation of what's going on in Portland like you recommended I would also recommend

1021
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
Got to where we are now

1022
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,983
From the perspective

1023
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,311
The whole time

1024
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
It is longer than

1025
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,919
That is true now

1026
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,735
Defonte using they print things out

1027
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,575
Cuz I will say it's on page three of the website and I don't know what that mean

1028
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,671
So as Robert lays out

1029
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:13,279
On the evening of the 29th to the city had their first protest related to the murder of George

1030
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Employ

1031
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
This was happening on what would be about the

1032
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,679
Third night of a group called the youth Liberation movement

1033
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
In front of the Justice Center

1034
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
The protest

1035
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Send it up converging that evening

1036
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:28,383
Large groups around that building and eventually broke in and trashed

1037
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
From Robert

1038
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,831
I watched all this happen from destruction was unplanned yet more less inevitable

1039
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
You could feel it in the mood of the crowd

1040
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
3rd Precinct in Minneapolis that just burned there was absolutely no way Portland was going to try to do the same thing

1041
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,351
The police showed up and they dispersed the crowd using tons of

1042
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,959
Protesters by definition supposed to be something it's kind of Confrontation

1043
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
No because that's the way these things

1044
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Work

1045
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:01,151
As such things coalesced around the Justice Center as they took on an actual as well

1046
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Importance to

1047
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,199
What's going on

1048
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,855
Nightly protest would occur at the Justice Center and they would often result in police tear gas protesters

1049
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:17,023
Then on July 11th

1050
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,351
Donovan LaBella in the head with rubber bullet for no reason

1051
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
People didn't like

1052
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,727
This was one of the more egregious examples of consistent pattern

1053
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,519
It started to form of police violence

1054
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
Taking place in Portland

1055
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
Is that being carried out with the involvement of Federal Aid

1056
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,431
Allison Tire career demands

1057
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
He be on the side of the protest

1058
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Of course he's not

1059
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,319
Ultimately I have to make peace with the fact that this podcast

1060
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
You know

1061
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
We can't do everything

1062
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
To another

1063
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
You can't be every

1064
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,023
Yeah it'll be impossible for us to get the best most accurate coverage

1065
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
This unfolding

1066
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,351
Still ongoing

1067
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Situation

1068
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
The best thing I can do is say in reiterate

1069
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,775
The first is to seek out sources of information that offer larger

1070
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
Preferably people have been there and know what's going on

1071
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,175
The second is that there's absolutely no

1072
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,479
Example

1073
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:13,599
Completely given up the charade that was his career than his siding with these federal government

1074
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:20,767
If you're a listener who show it

1075
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
Please

1076
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
You predict

1077
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Except

1078
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:30,495
Fake ass Soros documents

1079
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,567
F****** Leaf in the Wind

1080
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
Anyway

1081
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,503
I just see this is like another one of these

1082
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,295
Wow Alex

1083
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
You

1084
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,647
You don't realize or maybe you do realize

1085
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
Your whole career

1086
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,631
Will be disappearing

1087
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Chicago

1088
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Next week

1089
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,455
Might not stay continue if you want to see here

1090
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,783
I just I still maintain that if

1091
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
If

1092
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,391
Any of our congressmen are people under the age of 50

1093
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,231
Had the will to do it if they showed up on the front lines

1094
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Portland

1095
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,559
And made it an international incident

1096
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
That's the federal government

1097
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
Is disappearing our own

1098
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Now too

1099
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
That would be

1100
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
The way to move

1101
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,263
And they're not doing it

1102
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,847
Yeah man I don't know I don't

1103
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,127
I don't know if that

1104
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
No

1105
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
That means that there's no that

1106
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,087
That would mean that there's no limit I don't know anymore

1107
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,671
I also have no f****** clue

1108
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
You know I always

1109
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,839
Kind of hope that Alex had some sort of backbone about

1110
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
B cross

1111
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
No it's

1112
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
Scenes in

1113
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Various

1114
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,079
Quote-unquote documentary

1115
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,175
Yelling at people in fatigues who happened to just be walking on the street

1116
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
You know the people who do

1117
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,599
Exercises exercise

1118
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
Content about

1119
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
Of course

1120
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
It's just such a cool

1121
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Complete

1122
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Betrayal

1123
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,935
I mean even if it was like a if it was a leftist group of

1124
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
Proud Second Amendment left

1125
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
Plenty

1126
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,895
Federal government literally jump

1127
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:51,807
Alex with silver like see you got to take your right I think I think he was

1128
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,671
Nationalized

1129
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
These men

1130
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:03,071
Federal Marshals the most ever met US military

1131
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
It's the military

1132
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
Brad

1133
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,055
And then you're getting interrogated because you work for a foreign power

1134
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
Really trying to burn the country downstairs for the stock market

1135
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,247
Economy Europe

1136
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,039
You're a military

1137
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
10 gun

1138
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
You kill people

1139
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
Can you shoot people

1140
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Stop that's enough

1141
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,055
Losing a little bit there is no matter what no matter what

1142
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
Right that's what I kind of meat

1143
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:55,039
That's what you have to do we are now we have our own citizenry for so long

1144
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
Now the feds are just doing what

1145
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:03,487
We should be doing I guess I don't I don't know how you can say these things as someone who made them

1146
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,631
I'd like to hear Primus what Alex has had not recognized just the

1147
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,591
Definitely not the right word

1148
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,687
Did not do 911 and it was exactly as we said it was then.

1149
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,711
I agree with him

1150
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,735
I'm going to be honest

1151
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
911

1152
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
Not an inside job

1153
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
I'm just going to wait

1154
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
Okay I never really thought it was an inside job

1155
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:45,983
We had conversation

1156
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,799
Sad

1157
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
I mean like a course what you do you label the people enemy combatant

1158
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
Can be kidnapped

1159
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,551
Interrogated by the military and the movie

1160
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,367
I would argue that like

1161
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,439
I was a hundred percent

1162
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Against

1163
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:06,975
Adipose

1164
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
To the occupation

1165
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Wildlife Refuge

1166
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:17,215
If the military was coming in and like at night when everyone sleeping

1167
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,823
That

1168
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,127
The shooting of LaVoy finicum

1169
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:30,015
I don't like the idea that now granted the circumstances surrounding that are not

1170
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
You no clear-cut is just the police shot somebody

1171
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,767
Would like for that whole situation to have ended without anybody died

1172
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
I think they look terrible

1173
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:52,031
I would say if they were being treated the same way

1174
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
I will be

1175
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:59,199
The malheur side

1176
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:05,599
Higher-order problem exactly

1177
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,951
We'll deal with your occupation

1178
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:16,351
And this is like Native American land with you

1179
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,375
This is wrong

1180
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,703
But seriously the government disappeared

1181
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
You'd think that I would be capable of that kind of

1182
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,127
It's possible to Des

1183
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,967
Political aims of the people in Port

1184
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
Site

1185
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,087
Recognized

1186
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:42,975
Oh hey that's my Marquis issue probably be on the right side of it

1187
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,535
Is just straight-up like there

1188
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Dad

1189
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,119
Slime

1190
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,143
Next

1191
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775
Tabouli

1192
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,383
Who you're working for

1193
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
When Love

1194
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
Communist

1195
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Paperwork

1196
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Such big news

1197
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Oh God

1198
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,543
Now it says breaking out the hit

1199
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,615
Such big news

1200
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,199
Sing about is that

1201
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,647
Have Soros contract them like the fake ones that is the internet

1202
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
You have to always carry the contract with you

1203
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,791
Are people like a diplomatic tag or something

1204
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:56,191
It's like everybody gets together and then like I don't know if Carl was allowed to do that

1205
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
Got to pull out his contract

1206
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
Flipping through it like

1207
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:04,895
Note that one still good guys already contracted don't pull out your contract

1208
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,319
Say that thing

1209
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,343
Yeah yeah

1210
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:18,975
It's really really f***** up and I didn't expect more of Alex

1211
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,511
Kind of wood of Hope

1212
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
Maybe just because it would have been more appealing narrative for me like he finally wakes up and

1213
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
Recognizes like

1214
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
What the f***

1215
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,543
And then try to find some new ones

1216
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,615
In between land where it's like

1217
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Alright

1218
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,735
I believe in everything that I've supported Trump for this whole time

1219
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,599
I now recognize that those authoritarian tendencies

1220
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,487
Clear all contacts

1221
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
Locked up

1222
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,471
Song of supporting Trump

1223
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
You could be doing

1224
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
How much

1225
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,127
He's a liar and everything

1226
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:13,759
The world circumstances are such that he could be giant right now

1227
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,463
How many fake ass would a Twitter leftist suddenly became for saying dump bulshit that doesn't mean

1228
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:29,375
Alex is the king of Dumbo

1229
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,399
Legit Crush

1230
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:36,799
If you work just like I like Rand Paul

1231
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:46,271
That made people

1232
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,807
Maddow and everybody been like

1233
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,887
No I know

1234
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
Absent Alex

1235
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,775
You still would have ended up with Trump behaving the way he's behaving

1236
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
Alex supporting Trump

1237
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:18,015
Cause some sort of a butterfly effect

1238
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Alex

1239
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
Against

1240
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,999
Trump with his Decades of there's a police state,

1241
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
He would

1242
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Speed

1243
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:36,191
Probably one of the most famous people in the world

1244
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,751
Think of all the people on the left were like

1245
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
I didn't like before but now this guy's right on even though we still do are showing reveal that everything you said with

1246
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
They would love him probably wouldn't be interested in listening to

1247
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,135
Call Manuel rebooking everything

1248
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,671
Masshole

1249
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
What an a******

1250
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
Adidas

1251
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:13,055
Different world

1252
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
True

1253
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,455
It's probably inevitable

1254
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,087
So we back to this Twitter thing here and

1255
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Very stupid

1256
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,647
This is what we need to see more of

1257
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:30,975
Beautiful

1258
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Vlog

1259
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
Azar's

1260
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,015
At this point I see no claims

1261
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
Like I see no evidence

1262
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
The Patriot hack against the global

1263
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,671
I can see no evidence that all these people's messages

1264
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
The most relevant lie I find it really hard to believe the people like Bill Gates or Obama would ever use a flat

1265
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,887
IPhone like Twitter for any kind of important communication

1266
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:13,471
Contracts through Twitter DM

1267
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
If you imagine that they are in fact involved in some kind of a grand scale conspiracy there's no chance

1268
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Incriminating / Twitter

1269
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:27,551
That's what someone like Alex would do or Rodger

1270
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,623
The only person was affected by that hack that I probably have

1271
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,927
Bucked up Stephanie's DM Does Elon Musk

1272
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Peter van daan

1273
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:45,983
Addicted to Twitter and act like a dick on social media

1274
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,311
True

1275
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,871
I bet that's embarrassing messages that could be released

1276
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,343
Himself

1277
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,927
This is legitimately no different than Gary Cassity arguing

1278
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:09,279
Fires in California where are aliens coming to eat people

1279
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,351
They're both claims that take an actual news story

1280
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,399
Write their own versions of them

1281
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
More fun

1282
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,983
I'm well in Kerry Cassidy

1283
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
Patriots trying to steal

1284
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Come on now

1285
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
I don't disagree with you now

1286
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,735
It's debatable whether that is more boring

1287
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,343
Then I would say it is that is

1288
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,743
She probably Revolution

1289
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:44,863
Leadership word

1290
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,935
Stop now we're now we're in a writers room

1291
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
Obviously

1292
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
Supporting

1293
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,175
Trump doing what he's doing

1294
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,991
Avi law enforcement

1295
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
And Portland

1296
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,063
It makes sense because

1297
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,879
This is what our Christmas next clip

1298
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
Is this is this is

1299
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Pretty clear

1300
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
Federal government a separation

1301
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,535
He set up a long time ago

1302
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
Do you see

1303
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,983
It's the weapon we have

1304
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,639
The federal government

1305
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
Hollywood

1306
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
Federal government

1307
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,535
Call me in the Hillary still think they're going to win

1308
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,863
So I mean it's federal government

1309
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Dessert

1310
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:53,471
Weapons we can use against our real enemies

1311
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Democrat

1312
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,407
He's just really explicitly saying

1313
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:07,295
We are in control of the reins of power and because of that we can use that power

1314
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,343
To crush our political opposition

1315
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
Is there

1316
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
For the leftist and I was like

1317
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,887
F*** yeah I hate the left us

1318
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
And then

1319
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,471
I was fine cuz I'm not saying we just

1320
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,055
So we can covid news

1321
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Didn't really

1322
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
It's cute

1323
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
They're some of the headline

1324
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,759
Motorcycle

1325
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
In Florida says

1326
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Gaddam

1327
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:45,951
I just pretty much always the case I was recording on bulshit that isn't even relevant by the time he's on air

1328
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
In this case the man in Florida who died in a motorcycle crash and had tested positive for covid-19

1329
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
However

1330
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
He was taken out of a datapool

1331
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
What are the reasons for their being

1332
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,055
Question about it

1333
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
Chords for review

1334
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,223
There's a very slight possibility that even in the case of a motorcycle crash that covid

1335
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
Contributing factor to the death

1336
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,879
Is it possible that he only crashed because of about a severe coughing

1337
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,975
Probably unlikely but it's questions relevant in people's

1338
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
Anyway the State of Florida as

1339
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,095
With exclusion criteria place that's a has deaths from

1340
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,399
I'm trauma murder-suicide overdose

1341
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,215
Vehicle accidents removed from covid update

1342
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,311
Is basically a non-story that irises reporting is huge

1343
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,871
It is so annoying to me

1344
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
People have already thought

1345
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,527
Of how this could happen and created a process by which they could revise it

1346
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,719
Classify

1347
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
Grizzly classified

1348
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,047
It doesn't covid numbers

1349
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,887
And then somehow through the process that they already had in places

1350
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
So things work

1351
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Yep

1352
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,567
Bombshell

1353
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,983
You can kind of see how the goal posts are being moved

1354
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,311
In order to help maintain the

1355
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,919
Alex is hiding behind is that in the initial wave of cases and deaths

1356
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,223
The largest city in the United States was the Epic

1357
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:50,111
New York City at the ambassador's population and population density

1358
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,975
Control has created Perfect Storm where they were a large number of deaths in a single area

1359
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:00,351
As time is going on in New York has largely gotten the virus in check

1360
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,655
Stickley in the northeast of the country

1361
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,471
This drop is enough to amass be surgeon

1362
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,263
Recent apps that have been seen in the south

1363
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,311
In States like Arizona

1364
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,615
California around Annie

1365
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Theater Southwest

1366
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,199
These areas are going up

1367
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
Pretty serious

1368
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,295
But often and are similar population

1369
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
To New York naturally

1370
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Gross number of death

1371
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,671
Are going to be lower for the country

1372
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,975
You know they're higher in these regions

1373
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:37,727
Obviously I have no idea what's going to happen there are no

1374
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,543
Small areas

1375
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:45,663
Seems like a guy's just trying to explain away death

1376
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,527
We've heard that the Trump

1377
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
I was taking the reporting

1378
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:57,439
Away from the CDC

1379
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
Alex

1380
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
Covid-19

1381
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,047
CDC website

1382
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,399
The cdc's one by fauci

1383
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,239
Total fraud

1384
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,287
Good truck runs

1385
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,872
First thing fauci does not run

1386
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,176
DC

1387
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
Broadband

1388
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
About this Trump Administration

1389
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,160
Make the reporting taken away from the CDs

1390
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,464
MN Department of Health

1391
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,232
Human Services

1392
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,768
On the one hand

1393
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,584
If the recordings being done appropriately and professionally

1394
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,424
Jess is irrelevant

1395
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,776
Ultimately the CDC is part of it

1396
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:49,408
You know if in fact that this is just an instance of rolling out a new possibly update system

1397
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,968
Might not be a totally negative

1398
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
I don't really trust

1399
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,600
Anything that I just said to be accurate

1400
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:04,256
I don't trust that the Trump Administration is going to make moves to provide better

1401
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:09,888
And honestly I don't think that I would trust them to make this kind of

1402
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
The timing is weird

1403
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,240
Say the least

1404
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:23,968
We're in the middle of the public L situation

1405
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,576
Anytime you migrate systems there are some things you end up learning by experience

1406
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Making mistakes

1407
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,392
Those mistakes could be

1408
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:35,744
Very detrimental in the current landscape and we may not be able to afford

1409
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
Honestly

1410
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,816
They could be hugely consequential

1411
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:44,960
And that's why did National Governors Association

1412
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,520
And to make all of the information Pub

1413
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,824
The cheer said

1414
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Changes imposed

1415
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:55,712
Sunstate Health Department Hospital Systems which are already working at full capacity

1416
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,504
This wasn't selected

1417
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,112
Globalist nonsense

1418
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,904
55 States and territories

1419
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,488
Is cheering for a cover-up

1420
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
Whether or not I mean

1421
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,376
I can't say how things are going to go

1422
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:19,008
And if there was the possibility of a smooth transition and appropriate

1423
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,080
I don't know necessarily if it's

1424
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,872
The most monstrous

1425
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:31,040
Doing it now only lead to unforeseen trouble

1426
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,600
Point where they lost

1427
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
So

1428
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:40,768
Don't care don't care what their motivations are they can even do a good job you've lost the benefit

1429
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,864
We're at the point now where unfortunately

1430
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,704
It's going to come down to people to have to actually be like

1431
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
We won't do that

1432
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,592
You can say we're transferring it to the HHS or the white house or whatever

1433
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,640
The cbc's going to keep the data and put it

1434
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
Yet like that's where we're at

1435
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,504
You have to say no to the president United States

1436
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,904
Also Alex all of the state

1437
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
The contract

1438
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,864
They're all deep state that we're all

1439
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,704
Believers in Satan they're all doing all this

1440
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,544
26

1441
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,456
These diseases news

1442
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,760
There's no deeper coverage of it at all

1443
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
Housing prices in 2020

1444
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,072
NFL season may be in jeopardy

1445
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,192
That is just some of what we're going to be covering

1446
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,264
Today ladies and gentlemen

1447
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
Infowars.

1448
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
Newswars.com

1449
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,104
Please don't forget

1450
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,920
Have the Christmas in July

1451
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Beautiful now

1452
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
July sale

1453
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
What's the weather like

1454
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
Personally

1455
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
Bellwether

1456
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
For whether or not

1457
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
Can I be replaced by a news.

1458
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,376
At the bottom of a CNN

1459
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,264
Cuz then what if it was in all caps

1460
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
Dan Gregor

1461
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,080
You're right iron

1462
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,384
I'm going to just pull an audible

1463
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,968
The next like 3 clips

1464
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,272
Alex interviews

1465
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
I apologize I didn't write it down

1466
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:49,280
She's made a documentary about incels and also does not approve of the use of that term

1467
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:53,632
Apparently it's sort of a pejorative throws around

1468
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,704
She has a lot

1469
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:03,104
Sure I ever want to watch a documentary

1470
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
She's a great

1471
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,248
Speaker on Infowars

1472
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,064
Ucbi

1473
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
Yes

1474
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
The interview is kind of pointless

1475
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
And

1476
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
Just being Alex

1477
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Talking over her

1478
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,560
They're not yeah

1479
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,632
It's it's it's not really all that interesting

1480
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,960
I got clips of it on the thought that

1481
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
You know maybe some

1482
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
Nothing happened

1483
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:38,944
While we were like recording, I forgot it was coming up

1484
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
See Bethany

1485

1488
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:57,888
Write the book no idea

1489

Yeah so

1490
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:06,848

1498

Says the n-word all the time at all

This house 1050

1500
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,128
Trump

1501
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Never said

1502
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,112
Exorcist

1503
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
You are

1504
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:55,744
Why did you jump into

1505
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,048
It's about black people his sons

1506
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,352
I don't understand

1507
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
But

1508
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
Whatever strange

1509
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,008
I would say that

1510
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,080
You don't need to sign a contract

1511
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
That you agree to not make

1512
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,248
Usually that is it now that's called

1513
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,784
I believe

1514
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,184
No isn't making things up

1515
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:29,536
About people you can still like oh yeah that's just regular old

01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,376
Yeah do that bad about your time working for this company

01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,168
Or whatever

1518
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,192
Couponcabin

1519
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,984

1520
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:46,176
Make makeup

1521
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:50,528
Makeup

1522
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Cuz you could still end up getting

1523
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,392
You can't make someone sign

1524
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,440
Contract for what hours is this

1525
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,488
Already White

Tina that's so stupid

1527
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
That's so stupid

1528
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:08,448
That's so incredibly stupid

1529
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
F*** you can say

1530
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,664
Easily whip what's true for every one person which is you said there's been some reason because we're

1531
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
Get in the f****** culture

1532
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
And we got better beef

1533
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
Racist

1534
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
Hallelujah

1535
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,232
You do not understand

1536
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:36,096
That is a matter of lack of control

1537
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Trump

1538
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
And anti-semitic slurs

1539
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
All about

1540
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
Trump doesn't

1541
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
Say something in his

1542
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Sleepy doesn't want to say

1543
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
This is crap

1544
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Gentleman

1545
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:07,072
Funny to me and a compilation of trump saying completely nonsensical things

1546
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:10,912
Mr. Roboto

1547
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,448
We expect more

1548
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,312
Long time I remember how back in January 27th

1549
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,360
Just before Trump's inauguration

1550
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,408
Alex got trolled by a guy

1551
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,200
Twitter

1552
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,016
Trump saying the n-word on The Apprentice we're about to get really

1553
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:32,672
This guy pretended to be an embassy employee and just randomly said Paul Joseph Watson to DMC

1554
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,976
Any checking into the story

1555
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
Paul wrote up an article about it

1556
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,608
Alex filmed in emergency damage control report

1557
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,400
It went something like this

1558
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Weird Al.

1559
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,520
Play

1560
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,800

1562
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,128

1563

Random.org

1564
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Quite a few

1565
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
Terry Rozier

1566
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
Tape compilation

1567
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
Whatever

1568
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,912
Was him sitting in the chair

1569
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,216
Things like it sounds

1570
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,240
Ricardo

1571
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
Supposed

1572
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
Think about Trump

1573
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Long time

1574
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
Is he does

1575
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,576
Dirty jokes comedian with

1576
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
Boston

1577
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
Almost

1578
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
Stress reliever

1579
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Dice

1580
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,352
Deprecate himself as well

1581
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:50,752
So I mean like slightly different take

1582
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,592
Like a river

1583
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,920
Is that a defensive Trump

1584
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
What is

1585
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:04,576
Yeah I've heard him say the n word

1586
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,648
He's never said anything that he didn't mean to say

1587
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,232
She's lying

1588
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Same time

1589
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,816
Well I mean that would

1590
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,608
Sort of raised the question of

1591
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,400
If Trump is in such great

1592
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
Control themselves

1593
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,728
How do you explain all the nonsense

1594
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:29,152
I mean we have time to unpack right now

1595
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,432
Very small he's an ID

1596
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Bear.

1597
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,272
So Alex has another Gaston by that I mean

1598
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
Did The Hodgetwins

1599
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,072
John Hodgman

1600
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,168
Wish

1601
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
No it's

1602
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:57,312
These two guys I believe they became

1603
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,128
Comedian in workout

1604
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:06,016
And it didn't go well and then I'm like

1605
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,064
Comedic videos on YouTube

1606
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,856
Maybe some Fitness stuff

1607
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,392
Reserve Ferry

1608
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,048
Found themselves in the position

1609
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,120
Conservative

1610
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,936
Trump voice

1611
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
How do you

1612
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,800
So wild

1613
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
Is there not good

1614
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,408
It's really annoying

1615
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,760
Listening to this interview with Tom

1616
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,552
Speakers

1617
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,112
I mean just Elementary things that they have wrong

1618
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:46,208
Just make it so respected position that you're coming from

1619
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,232
Because

1620
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:51,072
Base level deceptions are trying to pull off

1621
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,656
And that means like I don't care you're not serious about what you're doing

1622
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:58,240
I'm in the second one is because it's so transparent

1623
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,288
Alex is using them

1624
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,336
He doesn't even know their name

1625
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,384
Why would you call them like

1626
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,992
Twins

1627
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:15,392
Time to know what their names are

1628
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,208
Twin they said that Trump

1629
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,536
Said the n-word so I need to have black

1630
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,328
I don't care who they are

1631
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,936
So wrong

1632
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
Just about where I was like

1633
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:37,408
I don't care

1634
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
You you you end up

1635
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
In a box

1636
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Macon

1637
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
He was just throwing up

1638
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
CVS

1639
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
The news

1640
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
Buy report

1641
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,184
Yeah she asked

1642
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Question

1643
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
People still being

1644
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
In America

1645
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
She hasn't

1646
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,448
Yeah

1647
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:04,800
Play salsa

1648
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
People being shot

1649
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
Publix

1650
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,208
If the public knows that that

1651
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,792
Down in America

1652
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,936
Police killing people

1653
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,520
I'm not sure that it's a good argument for people to say to protest

1654
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,568
Dubai police killing black people are bad

1655
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:42,688
Because police actually killed more white people

1656
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:47,296
I don't really understand the logic and how that tracks whatever

1657
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,856
That's a minor

1658
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:57,792
Twins talking about you

1659
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,144
The interviewer asked quote why are African-American

1660
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,680
I'm still dying at the hands of law

1661
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,752
Trump replied

1662
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,032
What a terrible question

1663
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
People by the way

1664
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,968
It is true that more total white people are killed by police each year

1665
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,504
American

1666
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,040
Is the meaning of statistic

1667
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,320
Contacts

1668
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,392
Because they're not equal number of white and black people in the

1669
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,720
Country

1670
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,256
Or science

1671
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
No

1672
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:35,424
Has been done on the differential

1673
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:40,544
Consistently shown that more likely to be killed by police

1674
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,336
Whitney statistics have been address

1675
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,872
Did the compensate for population

1676
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
Differences

1677
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,456
According to the guardian black people are more than

1678
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,040
Twice as likely to be killed by police than white people in America

1679
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:57,184
Quotes in 2016 black men aged 15 to 34 19 times more likely than other Americans

1680
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,976
Has to be killed by law enforcement officers

1681
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:02,816
And they were killed at four times the rate of young white men

1682
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
This talking point

1683
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,680
More white people are killed by police

1684
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:13,568
Is a standard Canard

1685
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,104
It's really dumb things

1686
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,872
For two reasons

1687
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:22,784
The first is that using the Staten that way you don't really understand the top of your talking about

1688
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,832
Underlying racist perspective

1689
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,112
But you're looking camouflage

1690
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
The second is that the natural conclusion of his larger

1691
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
Anywhere good

1692
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,584
Is the queen supposed to be the police killings are actually okay

1693
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,400
Is the message that they're trying to push is that

1694
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,472
Black people should calm down because more white people are killed

1695
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,008
Is the problem that

1696
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,312
Folks are complaining about police murders

1697
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:48,640
Or is the problem that if people like Alex have is that the

1698
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,432
Don't focus on the rape victim

1699
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,016
The logic of this argument doesn't go anywhere

1700
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:59,136
You have to ask yourself what the actual message

1701
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
And if you do

1702
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
I don't think you come up with anything good

1703
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,488
Best

1704
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,536
This is a defensive police

1705
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:10,400
At worst it's a blatantly racist desire for all social movements to Center White

1706
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Experience

1707
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,008
And actually I don't know if that's it best

1708
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,568
I don't think there is

1709
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,872
I don't know where this logic or this

1710
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,408
Reasoning goes

1711
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,432
It isn't

1712
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,968
Let police murder you

1713
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:35,488
White people should be in the streets protesting

1714
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,280
Because we're getting killed

1715
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,584
They kill so many white people

1716
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:46,240
Doesn't that seem like it should be the second

1717
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,008
Said

1718
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:54,944
Everything else look up and let police

1719
01:37:55,456 --> 01:38:00,320
Isn't that is why we must also vociferous Lee

1720
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,648
Supporting this movement exactly

1721
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,768
You're only bringing this up in order to

1722
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,096
Minimizing invalidate the people were protesting

1723
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,656
Which seems to be saying

1724
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
Something along the lines of

1725
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
It's cool

1726
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,264
I guess school for police to kill

1727
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,848
Interpretation of somebody saying that

1728
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,640
Aside from them being like

1729
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:27,200
And that's why we should abolish the f****** police

1730
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,272
Possible interpretation

1731
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
Is

1732
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
White people more white people

1733
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,160
Getting killed and you don't see the problem

1734
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:43,328
Like that's the that's the most innocent way I think you can look at that

1735
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,912
Taking the argument

1736
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,496
I've sat down my thought about the

1737
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:53,056
Cuz I'm trying to figure out like what is the mess

1738
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Hijinx

1739
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
That isn't

1740
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,152
Going down one of those Road

1741
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,944
Something I haven't

1742
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,016
Considered but I'm having a very difficult time trying to figure out

1743
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
How that statistic

1744
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:07,136
Is relevant to this conversation in a way that leaves

1745
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,416
Somewhere

1746
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:16,352
It can't be seen as anything other than an insecure response

1747
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,632
To somebody pointing out

1748
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,168
That one

1749
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
It's not about

1750
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
It's

1751
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,872
It is a fundamental aspect of our policing system

1752
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,664
That it is fine too

1753
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,688
You hunt young black man

1754
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,992
And if you of

1755
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,808
If you absorb that one piece of information

1756
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,392
That you have to change every Viewpoint you have on police

1757
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,720
So you're insecure response to that is just like

1758
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:47,584
More black people or white people killed so you know

1759
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,192
You're not that big a deal what's going on

1760
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:56,800
No I do not care for people

1761
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,896
There

1762
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
This window

1763
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,736
Like if this is what you bring to the table

1764
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:09,600
Killed by police

1765
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,624
Black people

1766
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,416
Stink

1767
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
That means something

1768
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,840
That leads me to believe that this is not like

1769
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,120
You're not a voice that

1770
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,656
Worth taking seriously

1771
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
And it gets worse because

1772
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
Bill Ware

1773
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,336
There's a higher rate

1774
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,152
Of black people killed

1775
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Right

1776
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:38,784
Something completely irrelevant in the study

1777
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
Play black people

1778
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
In Black

1779
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:43,904
Yeah but the

1780
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,048
Serbia saying

1781
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
White

1782
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
Intuit

1783
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,752
Population

1784
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Okay

1785
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,080
If you want to freak out

1786
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,360
What's going on if

1787
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
People being chill

1788
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,688
You need to take a nap

1789
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Police scanner

1790
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
Who cares about

1791
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,832
Call my wife

1792
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,184
Can you build determine

1793
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,424
They put a lot of the time yeah

1794
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,288
Your eyebrow was way up

1795
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,944
These complaints with the study that shows people at higher rates than white people

1796
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
A completely meaningless

1797
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,904
I'm going to go to waste my time discussing this

1798
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,744
But I feel like it's worth our time to really see the level of argumentation

1799
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:57,120
Like if your complaint with the study

1800
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
Okay

1801
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,008
M m s

1802
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,664
Have you tried to look for a study that only involves police indirect

1803
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,688
Intuitive

1804
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,480
Are you telling me

1805
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:17,088
You have existed in American Society for this long and you think that

1806
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
Black people don't have

1807
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,696
Higher rate of police interactions as well

1808
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
Interesting thing

1809
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
Like

1810
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:30,656
It does seem to me like if they had looked into it

1811
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
They could find a study

1812
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,728
About police interactions

1813
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
You have to look into it

1814
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,032
Right

1815
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
Like the fact that they're not bringing up a study that shows

1816
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,408
That there is actually no difference

1817
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,688
Police interaction

1818
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:48,832
Either haven't

1819
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,648
Look look if they were saying

1820
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,416
Okay

1821
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,696
Here's how it went

1822
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,488
They say

1823
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,560
There was a different

1824
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,096
Group u.s.a.

1825
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:04,448
All of the elderly and the entire population reviews

1826
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,984
For the white

1827
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,264
ASAC

1828
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:12,640
You know I don't know 15 to 25 year old male

1829
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:18,784
Black said you were bringing up that kind of a problem with the relatives

1830
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Sample group

1831
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,440
Using entire population now

1832
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,024
Come on guys not only that but it's

1833
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,560
It's to the point you know

1834
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,096
Where if you

1835
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,144
You just hear it in their voices

1836
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
Okay

1837
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:39,008
So you need to have a study that talks about police interactions alright

1838
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,800
Here's my study that talks about

1839
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,568
Police interactions

1840
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,896
Well well well

1841
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:49,504
There's always going to be a you should have had that this is the quest

1842
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,856
Borne out by the clip

1843
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:03,072
We could go by the police I just walking around the lollipop

1844
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:07,936
Largely motivated by opposition to.

1845
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:14,080
100percentpure saying

1846
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:19,200
You could bring out the study that shows like okay here's just police interactions

1847
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:28,160
Where is the number of unarmed

1848
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,208
The next talking point

1849
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,328
Precludes you from even going down that road

1850
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,680
And then okay we breached

1851
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:45,056
An impasse 100% disagree with you and that seems to be your willing

1852
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,152
Another thing is

1853
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,944
It seems like you have a lot of

1854
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,736
Another reason why I'm not

1855
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,552
Particularly interested in their their contributions

1856
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,088
You can see that they

1857
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,392
Have a lot of allergies

1858
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:06,048
Woman killed in Indianapolis that we talked about that Alex has been using as a race

1859
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,912
It seems like

1860
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,192
Exactly the same as Alex

1861
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:16,288
It mysteriously doesn't match up with reality

1862
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
It's information that they given a black

1863
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
Baxley

1864
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,384
Creating

1865
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
Racist

1866
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,992
So many white people

1867
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,136
I mean I don't see this

1868
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
Shooting kills her

1869
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,632
She had a six-year-old

1870
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,912
I'm not sick you're sick

1871
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,800
I mean what country are we living in

1872
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
Wasn't it a protest in her kid was

1873
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,432
The same thing

1874
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,456
Interested

1875
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,528
Just say all lives matter

1876
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,392
You know like that's what they want to show up

1877
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,720
And tell me that it's okay for cops to murder people

1878
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,912
You up with bullets from

1879
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:21,312
I want to play the squid because it does also demonstrate something that I said Alex clearly doesn't know their name

1880
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,896
And I don't want that to just

1881
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,432
Is it happening on the show

1882
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
You were trying to get into it

1883
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
What about

1884
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
Will let you go by your full name sometime

1885
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,000
What do you expect to happen

1886
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,536
Next in the Democrats.

1887
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:47,424
That is deeply deeply uncomfortable

1888
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:51,264
Little boy one of the twins I just called

1889
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,360
Someday you're going to have an excellent day I know what you're going to have a name

1890
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,944
The one last

1891
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,968
Hodgetwins

1892
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:04,064
Here is another reason why I just don't

1893
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
This stuff serious

1894
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,880
I just I can't take

1895
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,952
People in this Lane of the media.

1896
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,792
That's because they have just completely bad faith argument that they make

1897
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
If you look at

1898
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,936
Date

1899
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,664
You never see AOC

1900
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,944
Universiade

1901
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
Anybody

1902
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,504
Yeah you have

1903
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,552
This is ridiculous like

1904
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:41,952
Is right-wing online conception

1905
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,512
Unstructured way

1906
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
Agua

1907
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
Cons of supposed

1908
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,352
The debates online

1909
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,144
What is complete nonsense

1910
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
Biggest trolling

1911
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:58,592
And the rest is people thinking of blowing people's minds of philosophy 101 topics about

1912
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,872
That's not meaning

1913
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,688
But the online conservatives really think there's

1914
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:09,088
It's like some kind of important part of their culture where they do these online Bloodsport kind of argument

1915
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,488
Isn't really into physical violence

1916
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,328
Intellectual

1917
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,352
Isn't it a physic

1918
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,168
Violence do they have to get their jollies off

1919
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:29,568
It's so powerful.

1920
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:33,664
I regret a lot of the time that I've spent

1921
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,224
Listening to that b*******

1922
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,504
It is this

1923
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:42,112
Weird online world of people who think they're really

1924
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,136
Really

1925
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:48,000
Meaningful

1926
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,048
Play meaningful is only on

1927
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,072
The level of

1928
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
How many people are watching

1929
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:56,448
Yeah I know like there are large audience

1930
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,520
And people can't be swayed by really slick

1931
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,336
Sort of rhetoric that goes on

1932
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:03,872
Honestly

1933
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:04,896
It's

1934
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,688
It did stop

1935
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,480
Classroom

1936
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:12,320
Because

1937
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:16,160
Hodgetwins

1938
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:22,560
What they're saying is the chinos better than

1939
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:30,240
Debate me on anything

1940
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,568
Say you want to have a charity wrestling match

1941
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
Is the same spot

1942
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:41,760
She's a f****** congressperson

1943
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,600
F****** hangout dumbass Ben Shapiro

1944
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:49,696
Really fast

1945
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,720
And let's be real

1946
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
Alright

1947
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,816
The people who have holes up on this off

1948
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,352
Do not get

1949
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,656
That money doesn't get paid out

1950
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,960
Is always a reason

1951
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:06,336
I can't say for sure computers through 10,000

1952
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,624
Yeah

1953
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,904
Debate anyone point

1954
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:25,280
She also appeared in debates back in 2018 when she was running for receipt against Joe Crowley and honestly

1955
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:31,680
She should be way too busy being in government to respond to dumb dumb conservatives want to chase by trying to Bay

1956
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:39,360
Maybe like me challenge

1957
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,992
Instagram

1958
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:51,392
With the conservatives Dan they don't have the

1959
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:57,536
The guy who yells

1960
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:04,960
Although rent would be doing more with his governing power if he were to debate me there anything

1961
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,336
Spokes come in clearly

1962
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:16,736
Have their own cottage industry that I'm unaware of like I don't know who these guys are outside of there.

1963
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,528
There's little things that you can

1964
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:21,088
Use the tell like okay this is not a sincere Act

1965
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,368
The first

1966
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:26,464
Is the the use of argumentation like

1967
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,744
Thinking of that

1968
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,792
Statistic about

1969
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:33,376
People being killed more by cops

1970
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:37,216
That is a Dead Ringer

1971
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,240
Starting off poorly

1972
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Second

1973
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:45,664
The engaging with a study in the way that they did

1974
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:50,016
I got problems with your problems

1975
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:52,064
With the spider

1976
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:55,136
I didn't like their use of Arial font

1977
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,416
The

1978
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,464
The implication that

1979
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,864
People just deserve to be shot by the police

1980
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,192
We're going to be able to

1981
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:11,520
Get me where we ever to

1982
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:16,128
3rd or 4th I'm not sure at this point the

1983
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:18,176
Repetition of Alexei narrative

1984
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,968
That means that you're

1985
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,040
Areas are getting information from or probably not great

1986
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,368
Amende just sort of dumb

1987
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,904
AOC won't debate

1988
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,672
Kind of thing

1989
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:32,512
Which is just a Hallmark of these truly stupid world

1990
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:34,816
Online never just not serious

1991
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:40,960
You have all of these things that are just indicative in a minute interview of like

1992
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:45,568
Con artist

1993
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,432
And I just don't care for it longer Aveo

1994
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,200
Great shape

1995
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,224
Definitely

1996
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,088
Yeah so Nick begich

1997
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,368
The guy who wrote that book

1998
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:01,184
Angels Don't Play this heart

1999
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,720
He's hosting the 4th hour

2000
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
Unfortunately

2001
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
We have bad news

2002
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,144
Is awesome

2003
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,472
Ford hours

2004
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,496
Sunrise Jones

2005
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,104
Topshop some of this job

2006
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,896
Crazy crazy

2007
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,944
Austin weather

2008
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,480
Black lives matter

2009
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,856
So Rex is going to come on for the 4th hour with Alex

2010
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,696
So only black people

2011
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:39,072
I don't I don't unpack that

2012
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:45,472
You know talk about this video that he's made

2013
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,776
I don't know whatever

2014
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,336
I'm not going to talk too much

2015
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,616
About him

2016
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,384
Because

2017
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,432
The

2018
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,760
Stuff that he has to say is just repeating

2019
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
Infowars

2020
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,576
You know it

2021
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,624
It's a bummer to see

2022
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,464
Just get some like fatherly affection

2023
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:10,816
Debatable oh no what I want to say

2024
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:16,960
Focus on his Alex's Behavior

2025
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,616
Rex comes in

01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:28,224
Call Daddy created he couldn't sell

2027
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:37,184
This is really interesting explain how this product line came

2028
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
Came to be

2029
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,000
It's his ex

2030
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
I know I should

2031
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
How can I help

2032
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,064
I just feel like

2033
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
Somebody else

2034
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,096
Couple months ago

2035
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,704
Really good products

2036
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,472
Potassium

2037
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:23,776
Amazing

2038
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
So now what

2039
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,480
I

2040
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,272
Try to understand words

2041
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,088
Because that's

2042
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,880
That's a

2043
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:45,536
Listen to the implication of these thoughts together

2044
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:50,912
A year ago his dad came to him and said how can I help you seem to be under attack all this stuff

2045
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:55,264
Your USB company and I'm whatever

2046
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,336
So Alex is that Aspen that announces like

2047
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,360
Let's

2048
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,384
B-real

2049
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,664
I should probably

2050
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,992
B Delaware under a lot of attacks

2051
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:08,320
They're all this stuff is coming down all over the place

2052
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,136
I need to probably just step down

2053
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,440
And let people have their own operation

2054
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:19,840
Let's Let The Fly

2055
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
Absolute

2056
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,936
Let's get that started

2057
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:26,240
And then

2058
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,032
Coming up route to fruition

2059
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:32,640
Getting started plan to get Alex out of control

2060
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,664
Which

2061
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,968
If I'm to understand that me

2062
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:37,504
Here's what I think that

2063
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,576
I don't know if Alex is saying this because he

2064
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,344
Says word

2065
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,880
The Domina

2066
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
Yeah that's an issue

2067
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,464
But

2068
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:51,328
Definitely in the last 6 months

2069
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,376
I wouldn't be

2070
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,912
Prize

2071
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,704
If what was going on here

2072
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,752
Is Alex's dad

2073
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:02,592
Is launching a supplement line for Alex to sell

2074
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,872
They can Shield

2075
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:04,640
Set

2076
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:10,272
Sega

2077
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,576
Things continued down the road that they're going on

2078
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,880
You are so

2079
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:18,464
Hide assets under his dad's name with business

2080
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:22,816
Alex isn't technically connected to at all but he's getting all the profit

2081
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:23,584
It's alright

2082
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,888
So what you're saying to me

2083
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:28,192
If I were say limited liability

2084
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,240
And

2085
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:32,032
Somebody pursuing Infowars

2086
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,568
The limited liability

2087
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,128
They would be able to take all that

2088
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:40,736
Conceivably but if I had a different LLC if you did

2089
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,272
If you're well I don't

2090
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,720
I was like I need to take care of

2091
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,048
All kinds of products

2092
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,072
From you

2093
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:01,472
Large amount of money directly to you upfront

2094
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,240
And

2095
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,800
When people order that product

2096
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,104
Well I mean you can keep it on your shelf

2097
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:14,784
I don't know I mean like obviously what you're suggesting is what this smells like

2098
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,392
No

2099
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:23,744
Alex is going out

2100
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:29,888
We got these great products

2101
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
Need to say

2102
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
Product

2103
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,552
Now it even gets weirder

2104
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:49,088
Very specific

2105
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,112
It is not

2106
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,136
It's company

2107
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:53,952
Selling products

2108
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:58,304
Weirdly assembler around products

2109
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,120
Infowarsstore.com

2110
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,992
Electric

2111
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,528
Who I want some girls

2112
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,856
Top brass

2113
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:24,672
Quit your job

2114
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,952
Ingredients

2115
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,000
Are super strong high quality

2116
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,584
These are designed to be

2117
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,144
Affordable

2118
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
But it's

2119
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,800
You know we're underwater

2120
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:42,848
Shut it down

2121
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,152
Starfish

2122
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:51,552
So

2123
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:57,440
I mean like talking about this idea that this this is kind of how you might

2124
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:59,488
Structure something if you're trying to

2125
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,280
Funnel resources somewhere

2126
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:04,096
If you just seem like that's a possibility

2127
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,120
I've no idea

2128
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:11,520
Because ultimately the other possibility

2129
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,288
Name is

2130
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,568
In terms of brand

2131
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,104
Like so you just

2132
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:21,504
Launch all of these other products that are basically all the same things with different names

2133
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:27,136
And then maybe you know it's like that what's that f****** scene The Wire

2134
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,672
Where I asked

2135
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,744
What is the name of the

2136
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,304
The mass destruction

2137
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,840
New name on the street yet

2138
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:39,680
It seems like that's another possibility has recognizes it like

2139
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:42,240
Yeah the people who buy my s***

2140
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:44,800
Will buy turboforce

2141
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:47,616
In the mail by super male vitality

2142
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:53,504
Buried they don't have any stigma attached my product everybody else

2143
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,784
Does

2144
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,184
And then maybe it'll work

2145
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,768
That is a possibility to I don't know either

2146
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,304
F****** weird

2147
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,608
But he keeps couching it

2148
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,144
Wayne

2149
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,168
I'm telling you right now

2150
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,192
Johnny Wright

2151
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,288
I thought it was going to work but I just checked their website and

2152
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:20,896
He did use a giant picture of Short Round on the website when

2153
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,688
I guess he didn't know is a racist character

2154
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:31,904
Secretary of State

2155
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,256
Mbiz Travis County

2156
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:40,608
It's not there I don't know exactly

2157
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,264
Incorporated in Delaware keep you up-to-date on

2158
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,592
It's weird

2159
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,640
The move is weird

2160
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:54,432
Especially because

2161
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,200
Like I said

2162
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:57,504
These products are the same thing

2163
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,552
Basically that he already saw

2164
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,832
He has

2165
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,600
Rocket

2166
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,416
Rest or whatever

2167
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:10,560
Completely different things

2168
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:15,424
What kind of idiot would get those two mixed up.

2169
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
This wasn't playing

2170
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,664
A few hours

2171
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:27,456
You always have

2172
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
That's a that's a weird

2173
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,400
His words were

2174
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,680
2 days ago

2175
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:48,960
2 strong

2176
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,056
12

2177
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,896
The name is perfect

2178
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
He said I

2179
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,456
I was just had so much energy

2180
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,040
Is available

2181
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
Right now

2182
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:08,672
You trying to sell this product by comparing it to your other product

2183
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:09,696
Doesn't this just

2184
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:11,744
Cannibalized

2185
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:15,328
I don't understand why you

2186
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:19,680
Like maybe maybe his maybe is his

2187
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,752
Supplier won't work with him

2188
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
More

2189
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,312
But it work with Alex's dad

2190
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:28,384
Yeah maybe I mean you can launder it as though it's Alec

2191
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,408
Text Dad I don't

2192
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:36,320
I don't think so because anywhere discontinued

2193
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,880
Down the road

2194
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:43,232
This is a strange thing

2195
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,280
I wish I had more like

2196
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,816
Like a concrete

2197
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:48,096
But I just

2198
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:50,656
I mean we can at least make sure that he knows

2199
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:55,520
The strange thing because that's how he's advertisers he's acting weird

2200
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:04,736
I think it's required an explanation not being forthcoming

2201
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:10,368
Okay so I was like everybody trying to steal all my money and I'm so sad

2202
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,904
Right by my dad was like

2203
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,464
I will bail you out for the 3 million

2204
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:21,376
Destroy both of my businesses in order to hide money for my

2205
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:27,264
There was another way

2206
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,056
We got some new products

2207
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:34,176
That's why if you want to if you want to go back to your girl you can have a conversation with you

2208
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,968
Your dad I'm having

2209
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:40,576
I'm trouble all of these people alert

2210
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:46,976
I feel like I want to quit however

2211
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:54,656
That's where you could rationalize these other products and Alex

2212
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:58,240
Revenue stream

2213
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,520
I was going to quit

2214
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:04,384
This is my dad's way of helping me

2215
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:09,760
Those are the worst episode in the configuration

2216
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,832
That's what he said we have to start

2217
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:15,648
Do words mean we have to

2218
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:17,184
Really assess

2219
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,232
First

2220
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:21,536
It's erect

2221
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:22,560
Comes in alright

2222
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
The Trump like

2223
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,448
Adult women

2224
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,240
He doesn't like that Epstein stuff

2225
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:34,080
Who are cool

2226
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,360
Rex tries to interject

2227
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:37,408
Little boy

2228
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,200
It responds like a

2229
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,512
Let's just say

2230
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,304
Chaparro

2231
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,072
Swimming

2232
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
Horsepower

2233
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,008
He's not intimidated

2234
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,568
Red women

2235
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:08,128
Pino's 112

2236
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,456
12 year old girls

2237
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:16,832
Call Premium beer

2238
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,672
The point is he likes

2239
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
Full grown women

2240
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,464
Pat's

2241
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:26,816
To me should never be on

2242
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,400
Every single part of that

2243
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:33,472
You know I wish that I had tried

2244
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:39,872
I had told you that Rex was there you can see Alex

2245
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:46,272
The added dimension of his son and then he called

2246
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:48,064
Everything Alex was saying

2247
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,904
Would lead you to believe that this is what you should

2248
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:58,048
You're off to a great start objectifying women

2249
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:03,936
You're doing a great job telling us something that we literally already know he paid people to f***

2250
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,984
There we go on that

2251
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,264
B-93

2252
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:13,152
Also love denigrating by comparing them to meet scolding strange

2253
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:15,968
Don't be

2254
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,528
I wish you would I wish you would what he should have said is

2255
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:31,328
Implication no talking about the governor of South Dakota

2256
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:35,680
Talking about how amazing

2257
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
Imallexx

2258
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,496
Cannot stop sexual

2259
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:43,104
South Dakota state of the right thing and

2260
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,896
Trusted me

2261
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:54,112
His son is sitting next to him while he's grunting yes Mommy at a picture or video

2262
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:55,648
Show of the governor's South.

2263
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,416
Dakota

2264
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:00,768
That's inappropriate

2265
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,096
What is the family show

2266
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,632
I like her whiskey

2267
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:07,424
Keep going

2268
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,984
You were at a professional bull riding

2269
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:10,752
Event

2270
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:13,312
It was the first major indoor sporting event with fan

2271
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:16,640
Transcend smart how important was it

2272
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:19,968
What the f*** is going on

2273
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:25,600
Cheese's locker room talk on air with my son wow

2274
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:29,952
Wow there is just like I said I don't want to talk about like Rec

2275
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:36,352
Being you know on Aaron talking about like all these dumb liberals and stuff again everything

2276
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:38,400
Dad has

2277
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:42,240
Give me a pat on the head bleed

2278
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,264
How any

2279
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,800
Like horrible things

2280
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:46,080
Could be

2281
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,616
Like the product of

2282
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,408
Trying to seek the attention of

2283
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,760
Definitely

2284
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:59,648
Eventually I'm sure because Rex is on the road that he's on and it's unfortunate

2285
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:02,976
Yeah but there was still a part of me that feels so

2286
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,256
Powerfully like

2287
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,304
Kid a kid

2288
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,328
Yeah

2289
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,888
I would hate to be.

2290
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:12,192
Things things that I say

2291
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:16,800
When I was 7 this is this is totally like

2292
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,568
Small town

2293
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,336
This is

2294
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:23,200
This is every idiot I know and then some of them went away to college

2295
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,992
You know the liberal brainwashing

2296
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,320
That was f****** stupid

2297
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,928
Like it was escaping from the influence of you

2298
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:40,352
Any water but you know you want to believe that there's a possibility that that could be something happens but at the same time like

2299
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:42,912
How much is that is giving way too much

2300
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:49,312
He needs to be away from his parents before you can give him

2301
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,592
A like

2302
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:51,360
Your you're

2303
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:53,152
Your brain isn't fully formed

2304
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:57,504
You shouldn't be there I'm approaching this

2305
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:00,064
Disappearance is largely just

2306
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,112
Standard at Infowars.

2307
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,672
And that doesn't rise to the level of me feeling

2308
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,208
The need to treat him

2309
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:06,976
Like

2310
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,024
Someone who's on Infowars

2311
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:09,792
Right right

2312
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,840
I will get to that point events

2313
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,608
Probably

2314
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:20,544
Autonomous person who's able to make his own choices

2315
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,664
I just find it difficult to get around the fact

2316
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,504
Also somebody who had to deal with Alex Jones being his dad

2317
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:32,832
Yeah like

2318
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,904
Require years of therapy in order to

2319
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,696
Oh man

2320
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:40,000
I know my biggest problem

2321
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,280
Is

2322
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,072
Like

2323
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:47,168
By no means do I think it's okay for him to do or say any

2324
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,776
I think my biggest problem with it is until he's an adult

2325
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:54,336
I'm just beating up on

2326
02:10:55,104 --> 02:11:00,480
Like I don't like that if I if I was like a teacher and he was a student

2327
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:06,880
That's a that's a context where it's my job.

2328
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:08,416
Misbehavior

2329
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:11,232
I'm just a

2330
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:13,792
I don't even know how all the time it's Ernie

2331
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:16,608
Stranger

2332
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,912
And this kid is on his dad's radio

2333
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:25,312
Beat up on a kid

2334
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:31,712
Larger perspective

2335
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:41,696
Exist

2336
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:46,048
But I think the higher-order problem is that Alex's

2337
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,888
Appropriate

2338
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,680
There that is

2339
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,728
More of a relevant point

2340
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
There will come a point

2341
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:58,080
Where is Cross

2342
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:04,480
Existing

2343
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:06,016
Personally

2344
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,320
The point where

2345
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,856
I'm comfortable with that

2346
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:15,488
Horrible

2347
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:18,304
Person or a horrible person

2348
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,608
Your kid

2349
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:24,448
Platforms

2350
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,472
No

2351
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:27,008
I still

2352
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,080
Not going to cover them appearing on Infowars

2353
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,384
Twelve-year-old or whatever

2354
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:37,248
Adults should not have them on their show

2355
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,040
He's exploiting a child

2356
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:44,672
The only thing I have to say is the biggest problem here is a man exploiting a child

2357
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,744
And that it's his own child is real

2358
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,792
I don't know which is more f***** up

2359
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,984
Alex is sexualizing the governor

2360
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:03,104
Great another thing

2361
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,944
Well that was America brother

2362
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
This was the

2363
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,248
Major sports

2364
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,272
Recording the sound

2365
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,392
Right before the event

2366
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
To be there this

2367
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:18,976
Sample

2368
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:19,744
But what makes this

2369
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
Greatandhra

2370
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:23,328
Mrs. Jones

2371
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,680
Dimension of creepiness to this and that is that

2372
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:30,240
And then that the South Dakota governor of the rexha's new mother

2373
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:40,736
Governor

2374
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:44,064
Book the governor

2375
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:50,464
A shock jock show

2376
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,560
It was just an Opie and Anthony Style Show

2377
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:59,936
This sort of behavior there

2378
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:04,800
Alex presents himself as a very different sort of broadcast

2379
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,592
Capture and in the conditions

2380
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:09,664
He presents himself this is unacceptable on

2381
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,688
100 different levels

2382
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,992
Everybody needs to come right with God

2383
02:14:13,504 --> 02:14:17,856
And as we all know God wants me to openly speculate on how much I want to f***

2384
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:20,160
The governor of South Dakota in front of my son

2385
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:23,232
I read the Bible cover to cover my friend

2386
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,768
Twice is it mentioned

2387
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,792
You got two f**** out

2388
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:26,560
Dakota governor

2389
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:28,096
Next clip

2390
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,168
Alex he sucks Rex up

2391
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:31,936
4

2392
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,520
Erase baby kind of bit a little bit of a

2393
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:38,592
Bean and

2394
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:44,224
Exactly

2395
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:44,992
Isn't she

2396
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:50,880
405

2397
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:53,696
He's talking about like being out of the protest

2398
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:55,488
Blazing sun

2399
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,256
Open air

2400
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,048
Clear Blue Skies

2401
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,328
And

2402
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,376
Time when people would take their masks off

2403
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:05,984
5 Seconds

2404
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,008
Am I

2405
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,568
Restaurantes liuna

2406
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:12,384
Because you're white

2407
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:19,552
I'm going to be donating all my all the money I ever made in my life to Black lives matter now to make up for what I just said I'm

2408
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:24,416
He wants to help

2409
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:25,952
People by destroying their community

2410
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:29,024
I mean like that

2411
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,048
Stupid bit but it's

2412
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:32,352
Exactly the bishop Alex is trying to initiate

2413
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,656
It's irrelevant

2414
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:36,704
Completely off topic

2415
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:42,848
Racism against white people

2416
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,664
It's the 11th

2417
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:49,248
X2

2418
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,344
888

2419
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:59,744
I think we're all going to die because of deep-seated daddy is

2420
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,400
I think too many Psychopathic dads have led to too many people in power

2421
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,680
And now we're also

2422
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,728
Theory

2423
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:13,312
Talk about vampires a little bit

2424
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,080
Here

2425
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:22,016
That sounds like a conspiracy theory

2426
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,552
Echo bear about him

2427
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,856
Imagining child in the dark

2428
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
Kidnapped

2429
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:27,904
Shinedown

2430
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,208
4 days

2431
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,488
No food all the sudden

2432
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,256
Comes into view

2433
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:34,304
Cheer he's in charge

2434
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:35,840
The boss

2435
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,632
He's going to have his way right now

2436
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:40,448
Play my opinion

2437
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:42,496
I opened her

2438
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:50,432
If my dad said stuff like that to me in private I probably wouldn't talk to him

2439
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:53,248
I know

2440
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:55,296
I do know that he's not 18

2441
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,856
Child abuse sure

2442
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:58,624
Sure

2443
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,392
Fox

2444
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,416
I just don't think that

2445
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:02,464
Are you fine

2446
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:08,864
I wrestled with the idea of like is this even something we should talk about on the phone probably

2447
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,680
Ben on breaks on Monday

2448
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,704
Dab

2449
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,984
But it's deeply

2450
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,824
It says

2451
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:21,152
Unbecoming as a broadcaster is uncommon

2452
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:24,992
As a professional critic of things

2453
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:31,648
It's it's it's trash this is the trash and I feel bad

2454
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,928
4 racks

2455
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,280
I don't I don't know I'm I meant

2456
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:39,072
Weird limbo stay where

2457
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,912
I mean with this like this is so much

2458
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:46,240
This is so f***** up for me personally cuz like I'm

2459
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:47,008
Flashing back

2460
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:48,032
Back to when I was like

2461
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:49,312
13 years old

2462
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,104
And I was like

2463
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:53,408
Proudly like

2464
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,040
Read the Bible in a in a week or whatever it is

2465
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:00,576
I just want

2466
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:03,648
One to connect with my dad on a certain level

2467
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,440
And 2 for him to give me that

2468
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,208
You'd like

2469
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,280
You did good Slugger like that's what I was going for

2470
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:12,352
And when he says I think Stephen Colbert looks like a

2471
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,376
Pedophile

2472
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:17,472
That is exactly the next step

2473
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:21,056
Feel It In My Bones just like

2474
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:25,152
Dad I want to relate to you

2475
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,944
An evening

2476
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:28,992
He just can't get it

2477
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,808
You shouldn't call him a pedophile he's a vampire

2478
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
Everything

2479
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:35,392
Don't act like

2480
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:41,792
You can't even give him a good job site

2481
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:46,400
He's really interesting I even really realize that dynamic

2482
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:49,216
Correcting and Ivory

2483
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:51,776
The high status

2484
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:55,616
Buy naked

2485
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:58,432
Don't call people premium beef

2486
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:01,504
Now I'm going to spend a bunch of time muttering house

2487
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,576
The governor of South Dakota's Mommy

2488
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:09,952
Really interesting

2489
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:14,304
And maybe maybe I'm projecting a little bit cuz like

2490
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:20,704
Diaz Diaz

2491
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:24,032
Play teenager with multiple religious Studies classes

2492
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:24,800
Uconnect

2493
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:29,664
With my dad and my dad wasn't even Alex

2494
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,456
The level two

2495
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:37,856
Approval-seeking Behavior might not have otherwise been a client man

2496
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:41,952
What I'm getting at this really difficult is like

2497
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:43,232
I can

2498
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:44,256
Empathize

2499
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:47,840
Schroth

2500
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:54,240
And maybe Rex is up to that s*** off Alex's show but I just don't make it my business to seek out

2501
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,776
True

2502
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,640
The stuff that he saying is all exactly like what year

2503
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,432
Describing is like it is very

2504
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,200
Easily

2505
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,992
Categorize balazs

2506
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:07,040
Approval-seeking Behavior

2507
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:13,184
Why is it that everybody on the show makes me genuinely want them to get help

2508
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:17,024
Like I'm mad at everyone around

2509
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,864
Them I'm mad at everybody in this created

2510
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:24,704
That keeps them from getting these serious psychiatric help they

2511
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,472
Yeah

2512
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:28,544
Some people speculated that Alex was drunk

2513
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:31,616
When he's doing this like his vampire

2514
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,432
It does sound

2515
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:35,968
Like he's drunk but

2516
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,552
Doesn't make sense to me because he's not been acting

2517
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,856
Drunk throughout most of this episode

2518
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:46,208
It seems like the ignition would be way too fast

2519
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:47,232
He does have a weird

2520
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:48,000
Coughing

2521
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:48,768
Okay

2522
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:54,656
Anime

2523
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:57,984
Am I

2524
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:15,648
God if he does have covid I hate all of you

2525
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:22,048
Trying to figure out who Haile Selassie

2526
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:23,840
End up getting real alive

2527
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:30,496
Still shot

2528
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:32,800
Stephen Colbert

2529
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:35,104
I have no idea what's going on there

2530
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:41,504
It could have been that he took like a big Swig of booze and he started coughing or something

2531
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,112
Could just be the camera wasn't on him because he was coughing and he looks

2532
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,392
Laney

2533
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:49,696
Yes no

2534
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:54,560
I don't know what the cases of my professional assessment of this is I don't necessarily think

2535
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:59,168
He was drunk if possible I don't I don't see the evidence of it

2536
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,728
I don't know because he is desperately sad

2537
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:06,592
Yeah

2538
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:07,616
You know

2539
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,640
What are the same time

2540
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:12,736
He was doing fine generally speaking of an episode that

2541
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:13,760
He's drunk on

2542
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:18,368
We can print it you you to really really good

2543
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:20,928
Through the Journey of life

2544
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:21,952
Not drunk

2545
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:28,096
You started out a little drug test

2546
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:31,936
I generally see a narc

2547
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:37,568
F***** up I don't know

2548
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:43,200
And you were asking if Rex got a pat on the head

2549
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:47,296
And here's how

2550
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,832
This discount to close

2551
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,368
America was built

2552
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:52,928
On Christian Western ideals

2553
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,792
Openly away

2554
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:00,864
What do you have to replace our ideals with

2555
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,400
I know

2556
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,680
Being demonized

2557
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,056
The idea of America and what Americans have died

2558
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:20,064
Getting back to what I was saying he's

2559
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,088
Waddling off now

2560
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,928
So mid-sentence Alex's just like you can host the rest of the show

2561
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:34,400
Turn it off

2562
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:35,680
Because I mean

2563
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:37,472
17 you don't have job

2564
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:40,032
No she doesn't have. It's almost

2565
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:45,408
The end of the fourth hour or so like I don't know like it's Alex came back like right under whatever

2566
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:47,456
To be like

2567
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,224
My dad has

2568
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,016
Your grandpa isn't product

2569
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,064
It's very weird

2570
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:55,904
I said I don't know if you could

2571
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:56,672
Is because

2572
02:23:56,928 --> 02:24:03,072
He did trust him to host the rest of the four that interpreted

2573
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:05,888
You know that is sort of like

2574
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:08,448
I guess a show of trust in some way

2575
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:11,776
You can interpret that as a pad in the head or you could interpret it is

2576
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:13,312
Alex's incredible

2577
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:15,360
Interrupted mid-sentence amenta

2578
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:18,432
I'm pretty sure my general

2579
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:20,480
General Vibe is

2580
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:22,016
That was a temper tantrum

2581
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:24,064
Because his son was talking to

2582
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:26,880
And he didn't like not being the center of it

2583
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:31,744
Doesn't not feel that way

2584
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,584
Leave

2585
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:36,864
Emancipate

2586
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:41,984
Missing something episode

2587
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,264
That looks kind of like

2588
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:46,080
Force my hand

2589
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:47,872
By being out of Studio

2590
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:52,736
We're going to take another day off

2591
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:59,392
So we can check in on Alex really forced my hand was the fat

2592
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:01,184
Back that he talked about Portland a little

2593
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:04,000
In a way that I haven't really heard him cover

2594
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,280
The situation at all

2595
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:09,376
So it's really really relevant to our interests in our coverage

2596
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,912
To see him being support

2597
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:16,032
Because it's in a weapon that can be used against his true enemies

2598
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:18,336
Anybody who has sort of liberal ideas

2599
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,872
You knew he was going to

2600
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,688
You knew he was going to do it but

2601
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:27,296
I still analyzed at the moment he actually straight upset it

2602
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:28,832
I was like there's always

2603
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:30,880
There was still that part of me

2604
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:31,648
Maybe this

2605
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,184
Going to be the one where he's like

2606
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:35,744
I don't agree with Trump on this iPhone

2607
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:42,144
I think this is a government overreach yeah I think you should continue doing everything else that he wants to do but it's hard not to

2608
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,168
Get that like

2609
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:46,752
There's gotta be something

2610
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:52,384
It doesn't seem like the last Trump comes from guns

2611
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:55,200
Like individually

2612
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:55,968
I don't know

2613
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,552
Because of that necessitated

2614
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:02,880
Talking about this episode

2615
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:06,464
We're covering this episode and there isn't a Monday or Tuesday episode

2616
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,024
You know we got

2617
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:11,072
Talk a little bit about this

2618
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:13,120
F***** up weird shipwrecks

2619
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:15,680
Atlanta

2620
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,960
I might have just

2621
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:18,240
Ignored The Hodgetwins

2622
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:20,288
But I think it's a really good

2623
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:23,104
Case study

2624
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:23,872
What there

2625
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:25,152
Weather

2626
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:30,016
And then you coming you see these are the telltale signs

2627
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
Yeah

2628
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:31,808
Tammy

2629
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:34,368
Like I just think this is

2630
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:41,536
You and Alex Mead and alright personality and have no idea who they are

2631
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:49,472
As the monster show responsibility

2632
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:53,568
You think maybe the most important

2633
02:26:58,688 --> 02:27:03,040
Cuz if I believe someone who's competent at making sentences

2634
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,368
This might be part of this exit strategy

2635
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:10,976
How many times

2636
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:12,000
You go down this road

2637
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:16,352
This strategy has been in

2638
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,120
Spray year

2639
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,168
It does seem like

2640
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:22,240
Whenever he has mentioned in the past that I want to let you know

2641
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:24,032
Louisiana plan

2642
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:30,432

2643
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:31,712

As you see fit wheels on Twitter

2651
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:56,544
McDowell's giant Israeli review

2652
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:59,616
In your area to help out with everybody doing God's

2653
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:06,784
I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Michael Brooks

2654
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:12,672
Alex

2655
