Going to convince

00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:33,024
Sponsor a small Revolution

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,656
Custom Revolution a revolution against the dumbass Republican

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,728

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,840
I'd like to also say it's possible that his name is Chiron I'm not entirely sure

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
It's spelled like it could be either but is he scrolling along the bottom of our screen right now

10/10

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
October 10th

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
I have a very interesting

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
Exploration for us to do that I don't think you want to do

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
I found

30
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Let me just point this out

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
Before we started Dan was like

32
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Did you go get some more beer you might need it so that might be why you're angry

33
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Investigation

34
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
You remember of info

35
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
The trim is going to go crazy and say call Larry Nichols and we should say we called Larry right before the show

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,752
I left a message hopefully he will call back or at least respond

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,360
We called because we knew if we just called and you didn't answer on the show that's anticlimax

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
And on top of that

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
There's a there's an ethical thing where you need to warn him

40
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
That sort of stuff so if he calls back at any point during the show

41
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,280
Lyrics to remember if yours is gone at Larry Nichols calls back in

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
But we'll see we'll see I hope

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
He calls tomorrow and order in honor of

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Give him

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
I'd like

46
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,600
Somewhat popular starbucks.com

49
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352

51
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
Not sexy chat room

52
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,272
Sexy sexy truck political

53
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
Truck that says go fuc yourself Paul Joseph Watson

54
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
He's in Barney Rubble

55
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
I get it

56
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Alright

57
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
Do you need me to fill you in on what's been going on okay

58
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
So

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Alex is spinning his wheels about sat Las Vegas

60
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Because

61
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
He was kind of getting bored and not being creative coming up with new elements of it

62
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
When your narrative is

63
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,327
It may have happened and everyone I don't like

64
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Yes

65
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,703
He's Rich yesterday onto a narrative you is misleading people about about

66
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
A measure that passed

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
In California

68
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Where they made it

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Misdemeanor instead of a felony

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Knowingly transmit HIV

71
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Well the situation is we talked about it on yesterday show motivation

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Behind

73
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Stigmatize thing

74
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
Because part of the law previously was you had

75
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
To know you had it to be illegal

76
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Transmitted

77
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Which would discourage people

78
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
From getting tested

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
So that was the thinking behind the law

80
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Okay

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
It's it makes sense

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,983
And all the advocacy groups are behind a tell everybody who is a note

83
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,335
Alright well then I shouldn't have a f****** pacon

84
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,575
It's just a way for them to get HIV blood all over the country and killed millions of

85
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
That also makes

86
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
Sort of Defending Harvey Weinstein game

87
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Which is contrarian as hell I don't know why you doing that

88
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
But

89
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
Right.

90
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,639
But but that's where we're at

91
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
He starts the show off by getting back to

92
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Viva Las Vegas

93
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Situation

94
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
Galaxy wear

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
Not as important

96
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Today on October 10th

97
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,303
Broadcast

98
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Garrett anywhere

99
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
It's because

100
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Take the lead on this information while the same time

101
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
They're running

102
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Monday

103
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
Where you can hear the

104
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Looks like a muzzle flash

105
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
That's not what they were doing

106
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
This week

107
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
On

108
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
He's talking about an article that was in Newsweek and if you actually go read the article it says

109
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
On Monday Alex Fayetteville

110
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Nothing specifically say when he said it

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,703
Bright lights

112
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,311
From from from writing like nobody else

113
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
This is just amazing how to SEPTA

114
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
These people are

115
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
You're not paying attention to me

116
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,423
They now come out and completely contradict the official story

117
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
And basically admit okay Isis maybe involve

118
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,663
Newsweek has an article

119
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Remember we said that sources

120
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Didn't say maybe maybe it was the IRA as well from his sources on day one.

121
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
Neuseway Kelly X Usual Suspects

122
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Las Vegas

123
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Security guard

124
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
A full 6 minutes

125
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Concertgoers police review

126
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
What we've been telling you what a Witnesses said

127
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
Not specific things that Alex has ever said

128
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
And

129
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
The shooting of the security guard

130
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
Was in The Narrative from the beginning

131
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Like in the news

132
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
I read about that

133
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
The day of

134
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Yeah but what has he been telling you

135
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Telling me

136
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Subtly that he doesn't read anything

137
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
I like that still have that phrase

138
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,215
He's phrases that as a question he still has the upward inflection at the end of it

139
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Wait what happened

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
I don't even remember I am

141
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Lost I have said a lot of s*** I'm lost in my own spider web

142
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,343
New Theory I don't exist

143
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
It could be good but you're the liar liar I'll tell you that much bong

144
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Almost

145
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,167
So I tell I wish I could fire you up

146
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,775
I checked out that story in Newsweek and the title of the story is Alex's

147
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Just reading

148
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
Las Vegas shooting

149
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
There could be a potentially terrifying reason

150
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
That they refused

151
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
To prove it

152
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
If I did it

153
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Exactly well that's a bad analogy cuz he did it

154
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,303
This article in Newsweek

155
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
In this article they're not specifically say

156
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
That every law enforcement

157
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Source everybody

158
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
Says that there is no discernible connection between Isis or any other terrorist group

159
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
And Paddock

160
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
The shooter in Las

161
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,479
Play make it

162
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
No Nevada

163
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
They make abundantly clear that's not

164
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
The appointed the article but

165
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Dive into the possibilities

166
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,839
Since they keep taking responsibility for it what could their motivation possibly be and the article is about

167
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
The desire

168
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Of course

169
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
To create distrust with immediate distrust with authority figures

170
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
You did it

171
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
You are way

172
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
Right

173
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
My friend as if they did it

174
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
They would have some proof that it was

175
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
If they were involved

176
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Friday would wait for the media to say

177
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
There was no involvement

178
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
And then they be like haha your media lies to you look

179
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:49,471
There isn't like he wasn't anything like that

180
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
There is no evidence that he is

181
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
No one is

182
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
I'm pretty comfortable with that I don't even need any Isis

183
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
Showed up and they were like

184
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
He left the

185
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,463
He's an old white dude from Nevada who f****** shot a bunch of people because he's a f****** Luna

186
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
Does a slightly scarier version

187
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,863
About what's going on and we'll get to that here in a little bit

188
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,239
Slightly yes even scarier an embolism

189
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
It can happen at any time

190
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Anywhere to

191
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Was that mean

192
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
He's not involved

193
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
He's just a random ass f****** dude

194
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
And that's why gun control is so important

195
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Is because this

196
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
This is just a random dude

197
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Yeah

198
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
And could actually murder

199
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
58 people

200
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
59 people and injured hundreds more

201
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
And nobody really knows why other than he's insane

202
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Terrifying

203
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
I prefer

204
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,287
Furret if it was an organized military Oregon

205
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
You know we could be like here's where they might

206
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Could have

207
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Yeah

208
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
Someday you might be walking out of

209
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Concert and then you're dead

210
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Bummer

211
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Yeah thanks America

212
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,231
You know I want to double down on this point really quick

213
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
If it does come out

214
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
Is involved with Isis I'll be like that's a humdinger

215
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
But if

216
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
But if he's not then I'll continue to be like if there's no proof

217
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,335
That is

218
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,199
Will believe that once there is proof of it now it's does not have proof to believe otherwise

219
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
Right it's to believe Rogue thing

220
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Resources

221
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
But hate these sources

222
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
They're real

223
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Realsource

224
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,535
Absolutely

225
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,703
Ballistics

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
Ballistics expert was National TV shows

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Just real quick

228
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,639
Every time that song

229
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
He's like you cannot say what Seal Team I'm apart of

230
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
And every time he's not there

231
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
And at the same time he's like

232
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,191
She says like 20 times on this episode

233
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
You know it's raining outside is one of his sources

234
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Adjust the source of the stuff

235
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
But he says on air

236
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
That's one thing

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
Alex is kind of implying that he's telling another things behind the scenes

238
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
The problem for everyone

239
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,207
Members are the ones with all the intelligence I prefer Seal Team 3

240
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
Snob Avengers 2

241
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Yeah it's this point

242
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Is Alex

243
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Has real sources

244
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
And it was not questioning

245
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
And he knows I know for a fact

246
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,479
Does Las Vegas shooting

247
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
You might wonder

248
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Why is Donald Trump

249
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
That's a really good question

250
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Why is he resistant

251
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Alex has an answer

252
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
1011 days ago

253
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
October 1st

254
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
Cool music

255
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Dial by Monday

256
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
White House sources

257
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,343
Social Security

258
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Because

259
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Isis

260
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
With codes

261
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,559
Sleeper Cell attacks across United States

262
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,911
Verizon

263
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
That are

264
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
And also

265
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Complicated

266
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
I don't

267
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Woods built in

268
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
What are the codes

269
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
62

270
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
44

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Seal Team 6

272
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
Trump wouldn't have to say those numbers

273
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
What's the

274
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Will it rain

275
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
So if Trump

276
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
It was Isis publicly

277
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
What's going on

278
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
Okay well we can just say that about every

279
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
Find the nicest

280
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
As we all know

281
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Trump

282
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Very careful with what

283
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
He says

284
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Because what if it

285
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
It was the code

286
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,047
Right

287
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
Visit hamdingers it's the code on Mystery Science Theater okay

288
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,967
The Box

289
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Humdingers

290
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Who cares anyway

291
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
I think that Alex is narrative here is to

292
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
And I will leave it there

293
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
So we can move along

294
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,767
Alex talks about how the Las Vegas attack is a cover-up

295
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
There is a cover-up going on and

296
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Attack or the tech

297
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,007
Self is a cover-up covering up the details of the attack that Alex

298
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Has been trying to get his info Warriors

299
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
To know at the end

300
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
He lets slip where he gets a lot of

301
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,295
Cover this up

302
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
He said that last Thursday

303
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Itz'ana is he didn't say that he didn't act alone is like

304
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
It's unimaginable that he acted alone

305
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Inasmuch as saying it's

306
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
Crazy that you think he acted alone

307
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Which isn't saying that they have evidence

308
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
That he didn't

309
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Barbie videos

310
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
We can talk about the evidence yet

311
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,343
He did say that they were considering radicalization in response to a question

312
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
From someone who's in the audience one of the oppressed people at that press conference

313
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Looks like some people help

314
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Stop

315
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
So

316
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
Oh absolutely let's take a second to enjoy that he just said we don't know

317
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
What happened

318
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
We know that their stories collapse

319
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
About the very little

320
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Highlights everywhere we were right

321
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
We told you my girlfriend went there first

322
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
We told you

323
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
That there were hotel receipts first

324
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
These are all are hotel receipts you got room service

325
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,623
These are also inconsequential it was like a receipt for room service for tooth

326
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Days before

327
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
It doesn't mean anything

328
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,535
You could have had someone over like I made this point I think on episode I did a loan it could have been oppressed

329
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
For all anybody knows

330
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
You're going to go through

331
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
Not awfully always say

332
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,103
I do all of this stuff is like Alex

333
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
It's like saying that

334
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,271
Oh I told you I told you

335
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:07,135
That there would be an empty bag of chips laying next to the dead body at a murder

336
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
But yes

337
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Right

338
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Stealth brilliant about this

339
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
What are we talking

340
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
We're talking about all of his dumb narrative

341
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Talking about the fact

342
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
One dude

343
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Can get

344
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
A billion guns

345
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Take them into a f****** hotel

346
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
And just starts

347
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
Sure no one can stop

348
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
And no one cares

349
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,807
Before he knows what's going on

350
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
Jobs from getting all of these guns

351
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Explain to me why anybody

352
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
15 guns

353
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
If you want your argument to be like self-defense

354
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Protecting the home you're not you're not f******

355
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Protecting it from

356
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Cadre of Invaders

357
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Unless you think it is

358
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Home Alone

359
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Could be home

360
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,367
Enm and Alex.

361
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
These arnouts jump

362
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
We told you that

363
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
She was there

364
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Who cares

365
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
All of it

366
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
And you got it from f******

367
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Unfortunate

368
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
A lot of illegal pornography

369
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
A lot of people bullying folks into trying to kill themselves

370
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
Especially on the pole

371
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
He makes it clear on this episode that he gets a lot of his information

372
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
4chan

373
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Reddit

374
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
The Donald

375
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Who's like okay you don't have sources

376
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Bananas

377
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
How important

378
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,199
Like we had like four Chan turn into anonymous

379
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,575
Point kind of behind Anonymous for a while and then anonymous

380
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,159
And then Fortune was like Hey what if we were Nazis

381
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
Another

382
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
What if we just stop jerking off to h*****

383
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
And started oppressing other people

384
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,520
I think some of anonymous is still okay right I think they're still

385
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Yeah

386
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
But anyway

387
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Alex

388
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
Steve pieczenik

389
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
Rescuer footage

390
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
It's real

391
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,496
Israel

392
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
Wild hogs dear

393
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Nonc

394
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
Blow the whole side of the head

395
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,352
I shot one of those giant African antelopes

396
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Big Pieces of Me

397
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,976
Nose ballistics do different things

398
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
I think is a little off track there but

399
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Is gone hunting

400
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,960
And he's just completely started about Steve

401
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
Yeah might as well have ended with him being

402
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
And you go tell your mom right

403
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Damn

404
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
Jesus it's crazy I mean he's not wrestling at all with the factor like

405
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,880
If this is Elijah told

406
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Has he told on my show

407
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
I wish you would I wish you take that step

408
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
But he can't

409
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
I would also like to know what else is

410
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
That doesn't make me feel good at all

411
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
Junior explode through a f****** head I'm sure he's fine

412
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
And then he went in for another shot

413
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,880
Amox-clav to make the aftermath of Las Vegas shooting kind of about him

414
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
We know that's his specialty

415
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Used to say nobody.

416
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
And it really upset on television

417
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Explain

418
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
I'm not going along with it

419
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
I will not watch the footage

420
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Good

421
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,256
Play on your chauffeur / aminda picture of the shooter

422
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
Allegedly a very graphic

423
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
Fixer so you're not really taking The High Ground there

424
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
The other thing is the only person

425
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
In the world

426
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Who sang that it was fake

427
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Is Steve pieczenik

428
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,176
So far he's the only one that I've seen and so the idea that someone

429
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
He's trying to set him up

430
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,064
It's Steve pieczenik was trying to set you up not the media

431
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Do you think it's

432
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,672
Psych Warfare Steve pieczenik

433
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,280
Possible

434
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
That would be fun

435
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Even more if you just

436
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Was like

437
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
I'm bored

438
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
I'm an old man

439
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,824
Alex Jones is dumb let's see how far I can take this

440
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,968
Let's just say it's just to see if you can do you want to go to the Moon

441
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Cuz it's

442
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
There.

443
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,208
All that lack of gravity

444
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
Think of the position

445
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
He could go down those are the two I know

446
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
I just got a great idea

447
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,472
If we get a hold of wheelbarrow if we get ahold of Larry

448
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
We got to ask him for pieczenik

449
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
I don't know if they know each other it's like

450
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
Well if you're sick you have to call those guy I feel like it's there's a there's an outside

451
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:07,232
We're like a Larry Steve will stop calling you will leave you alone

452
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Iraq

453
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,888
So it becomes clear that Alex does not know what direction

454
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Action is up

455
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
In terms of Las Vegas

456
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Is narrative is all over

457
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
He has no control of what's going on

458
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
He's he's just spiraling

459
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
To the point where later is a guy named John Wesley Rawles on

460
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
Survivalblog.com

461
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
I bet he's a hero that they can't get him on Skype because he lives in the woods who taught him how to hide his guns

462
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,256
Broadcast

463
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
This shooting is suspicious to

464
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Is the guy the pilot

465
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
He should have just

466
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Flown into the crowd

467
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,800
Like okay Craig's I mean

468
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Rake

469
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
Good point

470
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Let me explain

471
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
The road along that way

472
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
Do you have to file a flight

473
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,880
ETA from it actually post 9/11

474
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,464
Especially when you're in crowded Urban centers

475
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Yeah

476
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Also

477
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,328
It's very suspicious he probably wouldn't have heard as many

478
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
I don't know

479
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Depends on the plane

480
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
That's how

481
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
That's how

482
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
Because there were those gas tanks apparently

483
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
Nearby

484
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,992
I don't know nobody

485
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,576
Let me let me just ask John Wesley Rawles

486
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Not as efficient as it could have been

487
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
But that's literally what this

488
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
Unabomber

489
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
I think a tree is breaking out in the chat room everyone's Calling lyrics

490
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,504
Spiraling out of control

491
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
And that's because they know they're not going to be able to cover it up

492
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
Because law enforcement music going along with it

493
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
And when it comes out

494
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
Criticism of trump now

495
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
The constellations brought Trump win

496
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
The populist resistance

497
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,624
Before we get into this part I just don't like the idea that he saying

498
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
Like a worldwide populist uprising

499
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Another apart of

500
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,792
Because that ties

501
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
People across

502
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,168
The global influence

503
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
In the United

504
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
States with cool guys

505
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
These people are just

506
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Connect

507
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
They all have their own nationalist populist

508
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Uprising

509
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
Perfect sets

510
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,984
He was saying that earlier as if it was what he believed now he's like I don't believe that

511
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
No idea what's going on

512
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,384
No control over his own like

513
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
The way Fraser

514
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
Cuz it makes it seem like

515
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
I'm willing to believe that it

516
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Beginning of the show

517
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,208
Didn't mean to say that like there is a code like Isis code in history

518
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
This is this is what sources are telling us this is what we this is what we're putting out his news now I don't believe that.

519
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,192
That's the global @fbi

520
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
I'm coming out

521
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Blocking

522
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Holyfuck

523
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
Document

524
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Now they blame Trump

525
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,024
No but Alex's narrative is completely made up the idea of the trumpster teamsters went on strike

526
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
In order to

527
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Stop

528
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
The goods out

529
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
Tomato

530
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Believably affair

531
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,896
This is very much though especially because the energy from include the people in the Union

532
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,224
Teamsters a local Puerto Rico

533
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,576
We are not going on strike

534
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
This argument mean

535
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
He has to know that he's saying the absolute

536
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Opposite of the truth

537
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
In Puerto Rico

538
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Are doing everything they f******

539
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
Because so many people still don't have water

540
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Still don't have power

541
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Can't I can are starving

542
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Are starving

543
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:17,248
Families are starving and people who are there who are are all really really trying to help

544
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
And there's only one

545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,624
Small group of people

546
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,208
And that's Trump and his f****** monster

547
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
So how

548
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,656
I hate how dare you

549
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Monster

550
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
What song is this

551
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Launching there

552
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Communist uprising

553
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
This is the final countdown

554
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
How many days are we out now

555
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
And we're ready

556
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah

557
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,752
Smash cut to November 5th

558
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,336
No communist upright remember remember

559
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
7th of November

560
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
When we've actually

561
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,784
My friend

562
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm going to start an uprising it's going to be

563
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Arrhythmic

564
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,000
What Alex believes that everything is based on movies and I know the Guy Fawkes was real

565
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
He thinks the beaver Vendetta is the

566
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,448
What is the true story

567
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
Through V for Vendetta

568
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:48,640
Years ago predicted program plan out there for 2017

569
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,040

570
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Hozier the Bolsheviks

571

Here in America

572
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416

Chat room

578
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Chat room

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,784
I need you to be very serious right now are you guys f****** around about Larry asking for a call

580
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,904
They are saying he called them back

581
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
But I think they're f******

582
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
I'm not entirely sure

583
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
I'm getting a 100% true message from that actually happened is they called me

584
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,104
Never call me again and now you're calling into a trap remember

585
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
I will

586
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992

I'm sorry to hear that

589
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Just so you know this

590
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
We are alive

591
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Streaming on Twitch right now

592

Let you know we got a couple of questions for you if you're willing to

593
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Alrighty

594
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
First off of course

595
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,224
Did you do actually have information that you are willing to

596
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
Used to take down the GOP

597
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Would you

598
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Not yet

599
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
Would you mind sharing

600
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Just a little bit with us

601
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Blackmail

602
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Okay

603
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Well

604
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
My my co-host

605
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Pointed out that

606
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
That could be.

607
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Describe this black

608
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Mail

609
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
In a court of law

610
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
It could be

611
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
I think you're the one who has me in

612
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Don't have spam

613
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Cygnet Court

614
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
So are you are you actually threatening

615
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Blackmail

616
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
2

617
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,264
If they do what you want them to do

618
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
No problem

619
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
If you'd like

620
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Would you like to

621
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
No I understand

622
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
Would you like to text me or

623
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Have me give you a call later

624
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Okay

625
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
Sounds like a plan hope you feel better

626
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Alright

627
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Have a good night

628
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Good boy

629
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,944
We can take from that

630
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
How how did it look when we doing with our lives

631
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,656
Well I'm just saying and I have information that I will use

632
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
If they don't do what I want them to do

633
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Black male that's just me saying that I will tell the truth but I won't tell the truth

634
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
If they do what I want them to do

635
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
So I think that's more proof that he threatening to Blackmail Congress although his answer would be we are not threatening.

636
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Blackmail Congress

637
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,488
I would love to take him to court for that but I'm not Congress I don't have standing to take him to court

638
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,072
Is get you elected as the representative work

639
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,216
Call our representative

640
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
I feel terrible like he really

641
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:08,480
And I want to get an interview with him tomorrow

642
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
Here was the only problem with that

643
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
For some reason

644
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,672
Even though I knew we were going to call him tonight I have no point planned any questions

645
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:22,048
Well that's the big question question but what's up with some softballs

646
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
And then maybe he would have been trusting anybody

647
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,704
I just jumped you knew he was going to get off the phone sooner than later

648
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,080
He sounds terrible I don't mean that judgmental

649
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
Central Arkansas

650
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Would be central time probably a 70-something year old dude

651
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,792
Wow

652
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
We got him basically to admit that he is blackmailing Congress but not black

653
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:06,336
Cigarette after that yeah

654
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
I'm a little bit already check there's blood cell

655
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,064
Harvey Weinstein situation in our position

656
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,648
Harvey Weinstein go f*** himself

657
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
And

658
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
Alex is Takis

659
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Super convoluted

660
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,608
And touches on victim-blaming in a way that I'm not surprised by but I'm at

661
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
I'm still uncomfortable

662
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Minimize it

663
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
About

664
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
Simply hitting on women

665
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
And cheating on his wife

666
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
We are angry about

667
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
90

668
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
Women saying

669
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,520
That's pretty clear

670
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Make it all about you

671
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Pervert

672
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
And then forcing yourself on

673
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
It's

674
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
Not really doesn't matter anymore

675
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Scary stories

676
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Here's the deal

677
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
Whether it's true or not

678
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
It's all part of the same slime

679
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,528
There's some truth to what you're getting into when you go to Hollywood

680
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
Special

681
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Some of the young

682
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,912
Girls watch TV all day

683
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
Continue California

684
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
No chicken the bees a crack w****

685
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
Snuff film

686
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
He probably read that unfortunate

687
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,536
What the f*** is this on Reddit / of a Donald

688
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Bill is a rapist

689
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,704
If our show were bigger you get $2,500 for saying that

690
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:46,848
Are you know what I did to something that I really really thought about after this

691
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Harvey Weinstein

692
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Is that

693
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,552
Everybody's like why are you talking about how Trump is a racist do you know we're only condemning racist when I

694
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,648
Whenever they're on the the wrong side

695
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
There is some truth to that

696
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,816
Is the f****** rapist

697
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,216
But you're right there is more than needs to be addressed about that

698
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,592
Write like all of these most likely this is and this is the this is nothing like

699
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,896
Now I remember how

700
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Small a deal

701
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Like relatively speaking

702
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
Speaking people made of that when Clinton was President

703
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Sure

704
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
Ended up being

705
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Stuff ended up not being true

706
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Stop Larry Nichols

707
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
To the Forefront

708
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,704
Liza Larry Nichols brought up muddy the issue of what Clinton actually did get a lot of terrible things

709
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Polishing it

710
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
It made a lot of people tune out there is a friend on the phone Larry Nichols is responsible for some of that

711
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
1 things that I think is super inch

712
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,479
Interesting is on yesterday show Mike cernovich was on

713
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
And he was trying to make the point that he's like

714
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Oh this is like

715
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,903
I want to say that it's really cool that there are Democrats

716
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Who are

717
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,047
I'm sending back money that you donated and donating it and

718
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,911
Stuff like that you know I always expect

719
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
If you don't expect them to defend him

720
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,311
It's really cool to see that they're you know they denounce

721
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
Going to get really mad

722
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,735
About Republicans but they're getting really mad about this and I was like

723
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
You see like Mike cernovich

724
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
Try and reduce that talking point into Infowars

725
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
And it just beat like

726
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
There's a

727
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Super weird

728
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Send.

729
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Like he's saying all this

730
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,839
Stop

731
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,215
You know hitting on ladies and cheating on your wife as opposed to the reality what it is

732
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,615
We are defending him accidentally

733
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Defend rapist cuz I

734
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
Arepas but I'm saying if anybody is a rapist

735
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
That I don't know is a rapist

736
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
About that

737
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,487
Look here's the here's the thing that I really can't

738
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,559
Here's the thing that I really thought about a lot

739
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
With this Harvey Weinstein

740
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
It is

741
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Something that

742
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Because I don't have to

743
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
To personally deal with

744
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
I have

745
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,335
Absolutely not giving enough at

746
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
In my life

747
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Absolute

748
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Sure

749
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
It's

750
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
It's mind-boggling to me

751
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
That I haven't

752
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,831
Like for all of my

753
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
You know

754
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
B*******

755
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Liberal Progressive righteousness

756
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,351
What are the other is at the other side like all I can do is scream about how this s*** is is awful

757
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
We know comedians in Chicago

758
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,775
Who have absolutely committed similar things

759
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
I can't

760
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
I want to speak out about this

761
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,967
That's right but the people that we've talked to the victims of this b******* have universally said

762
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Don't say anything

763
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,831
Yeah and I don't know I don't know what to do about that

764
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:13,951
Certainly not on the show

765
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Certainly not

766
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:20,351
Calling Larry Nichols is dicey enough territory I don't know I don't know what the right answer

767
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,447
Incredibly complicated I don't know

768
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
But it's something to wrestle with something

769
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,847
To listen to people and try and figure out what the right answers I'm not sure

770
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,687
Will you you know you read all of this all of this s***

771
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
A lot of it comes down to like

772
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,807
Hey this should just be women who have to speak out about

773
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,671
This should be men speaking out about it too

774
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
I really do

775
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
But I don't know how to name names

776
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
Without the victim's approval

777
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,911
Other than to say snot other than to say this guy is a f******

778
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,007
Sexual harasser he's a Serial sexual assault

779
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,079
I have no proof because nobody wants to come

780
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
Admitted

781
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,687
I don't know I don't know what the f***.

782
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
To do because I want to do something

783
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
Something mean

784
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,111
Well with respecting the wishes of the 1st

785
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
I just it's not

786
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,047
I'm I'm I'm I'm worried

787
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
On a certain level

788
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
It varies it there's a piece that you're

789
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
Complaining about your position in this

790
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,751
But you're a tertiary character actual

791
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Bright

792
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Calm down

793
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
Okay I'm not good at listen to people and be empathic that's the best thing we can do

794
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:47,391
Where Alex pretend moving actually about Trump

795
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Restaurants

796
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,559
Girlfriend everyday is what this is all about

797
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Of course they're going after him

798
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,823
To make it about a men's war on women

799
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
So real quick real quick

800
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
Here is what he's talking about

801
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
And then they're going to roll women out there

802
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,559
MLB

803
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
Crystallize this morning

804
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
I'm looking at it

805
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
She's going to happen

806
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Alex is a gene

807
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
It happened

808
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:46,015
I believe it's August 8th people come outside they've been assaulted by truck

809
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Yeah

810
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
The people who cared about it

811
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Maybe didn't care about it for the right

812
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Supposedly care about it now that

813
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Tina Scott doing

814
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
Voted for

815
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
Yeah it's it's it's

816
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,567
85% of our presidents have committed sexual assault in some form another

817
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,967
Probably America's filled with white racist

818
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,807
Intrinsic problem with how our culture has treated male power

819
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
It is unfortunate

820
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
It's accepted

821
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Yeah

822
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
That's why it's everywhere

823
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
Let's move along

824
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
Next clip

825
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
Where Alex Jones talks

826
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
About 40 per-cent of men

827
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Let's just

828
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,567
Mobile number

829
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
If you take a hundred percent

830
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
And you minus that 40%

831
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
You get 60

832
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
That number is relevant

833
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
This clip

834
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
Bad transition

835
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:56,159
Transition transmission

836
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,439
Checkpoint the last 2 weeks

837
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Rental Truck

838
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
Closer to 60%

839
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,687
Facebook

840
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,343
So please do hold on to the let's explain something cuz it actually goes to a really f****** funny play

841
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,903
The research came here

842
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,719
Because I have pulled up Trump's approval rating

843
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
Currently an aggregate of all of the

844
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
Currently at 8:50

845
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
6.7 disapproval rating

846
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
Any 37.5 approval rating

847
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,007
If you weren't even add Alex's very generous 15

848
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Points to the 37th

849
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
.5 still

850
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
Still a bit south of it's 60 prediction

851
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,991
But there's just absolutely no way that works misinterpreting house 22

852
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
It's work in terms of

853
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Not under

854
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
Stuff like that

855
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Allow you to move

856
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
I'm sorry for interrupting

857
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
I don't

858
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
About the approval ratings polls

859
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Because

860
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,383
Those people would vote for him again

861
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
If we did the election

862
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Tomorrow

863
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
It doesn't matter what his approval rating

864
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:31,391
Are they would still vote that weird 37% every single

865
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
Maybe not everyone but

866
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,487
Most of those GOP identified voters

867
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
Would do it over again

868
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,447
I don't give a f*** what they think about their shity president that they elected if they would vote for the GOP again

869
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Because Trump is not

870
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
It's not

871
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
An outlier in the

872
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
GOP

873
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,127
I was doing everything that the GOP is always

874
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Wanted to do

875
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
REI

876
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
Right

877
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,463
There's an article in Business Insider that came out this afternoon the track

878
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,023
The change in Trump's net approval rating

879
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,375
And if you look at this it down in literally every

880
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Tri-State

881
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Every state

882
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,983
Since the election Trump has gone down

883
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
At least

884
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
11

885
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
Net point

886
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,383
In terms of his approval would be the

887
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
The

888
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
Approval - disapprove

889
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,063
Alex Jones has a strong bed

890
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
Good whatever he's at

891
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
14 points down

892
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
In terms of the net approval rating

893
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,047
Illinois-chicago baby down 30.6

894
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
Terms of net approval

895
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,399
Reflecting higher

896
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
0%

897
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
What's the most

898
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
Conservative State you can think of like Wyoming

899
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,055
14.1 points

900
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,591
I think isn't it like

901
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,639
West North

902
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Dakota that

903
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,783
North Dakota down 15.7%

904
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Right so

905
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:09,439
I don't know if I mean it's just the idea that he's up at all in the polls are they any good

906
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
He's completely

907
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Rosati

908
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Maybe the better question

909
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
Rather than his

910
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Approval Ardis

911
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
AR

912
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Would you

913
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Knowing what you know now

914
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
Would you about it for him

915
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
Because the answer wood

916
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Who gives a f*** about us

917
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
Approval-disapproval rating

918
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,391
Is the president until our

919
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Bulshit

920
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
Chevy oligarchs have the balls to pressure

921
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
There

922
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
Bought Congressman to actually do some

923
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,887
He's going to prove or disapprove

924
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
It's too late

925
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
Probably so here is the end of that clip again

926
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
I got it

927
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
He's going to explain

928
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,711
Is

929
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
Somewhere we trying to buy a vacation

930
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
You got to reset

931
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Your cookies

932
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,231
Cuz if you don't reset your cookies they're going to charge you a higher price

933
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
Makes perfect sense up on that s***

934
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
Answer that leads into this

935
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
This is Maybe

936
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,887
A minute and a half later

937
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Weird

938
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
That's good advice

939
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,007
Reasonable Drive

940
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,591
I'll tell my wife

941
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
Watch this

942
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
And every

943
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
The product

944
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
AR Lower

945
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Price of magic

946
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,255
Talkabouttd

947
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
Covering about face

948
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,847
Brought up.com

949
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
It's the same price you see

950
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Do stuff

951
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Wow

952
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:16,415
So good smooth silky smooth

953
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
From Alex Jones

954
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:25,631
To do not buy any valak goes on 6 minutes

955
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,215
It's painfully long

956
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,775
Keep talking about Las Vegas

957
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,591
Now he's got to talk about air filters

958
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,919
So he doesn't 6-minute add goes to Commercial and then comes back

959
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,223
It gets into something else that's stuck in his

960
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Scroll

961
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,999
If anybody knows what music playing behind him

962
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
Uno

963
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
Easter break

964
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,503
Inception

965
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
A big old fat

966
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Music

967
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
That's code isn't the opposite

968
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
NFL giving into Trump

969
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
Waving the white flag

970
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,287
I still think it's a little bit of a

971
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
A little bit of

972
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Little doggie whistle

973
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,943
What the white flag was really hard

974
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,343
Let's

975
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Yeah

976
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
I don't know it just struck my ears

977
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
50% in viewership

978
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
But he says

979
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,839
Juicy

980
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
Gross

981
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,215
Disgusting can make describing numbers gross

982
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
I thought I don't know I don't like him calling anything

983
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Juicy

984
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
And then I'm going to dive into my investigation

985
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
I hope we have more than those four beers

986
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,855
I was going to say we're already about an hour and now getting to the

987
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,951
Of the episode Special Report

988
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
Actually let me rephrase

989
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:34,143
And I have kept you from diving into the meat of the episode for this long

990
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Making good time

991
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,967
I'm going to be screaming at you

992
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
Yeah you're the last little clip

993
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,575
Alex just saying weird stuff that I

994
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Just coded line

995
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:58,719
Ghost of the Old Republic

996
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
Burning in the heart

997
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
Ears

998
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,959
I would love that to be my intro coming up on stage

999
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,799
Verizon

1000
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:19,199
Here's that

1001
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,575
He introduces Bannon talking about how they're going to primary all these Republicans who don't go along with

1002
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,647
The Trump agenda never going to take down establishment Republicans

1003
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:33,279
Alright you guys you guys f******

1004
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
Okay have a war within your rank

1005
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,399
Negative

1006
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
What's going to come out of that war obviously

1007
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,383
Other people are what they don't realize is that they created

1008
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,455
The dumb people that are going to destroy them

1009
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Looks like aloe vera always Republican did the GOP

1010
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,975
Capable of controlling this monster and then

1011
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:08,351
I'm talking about

1012
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
For us

1013
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,935
Is it negative if they're going to destroy

1014
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
The GOP establishment because what comes out of it is so much worse

1015
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,567
Ladies Alex Jones School

1016
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,639
Liberty Movement

1017
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Because at least

1018
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
I mean

1019
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
Sable

1020
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:29,599
Politicians are great well it's not as close to Sovereign citizen

1021
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,719
That's my position you want to be as far away from Sovereign citizens in general is pasa

1022
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,791
I do think that there is an

1023
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
A legitimate parallel now

1024
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Between

1025
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
The progressive

1026
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
Wing of

1027
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
The left

1028
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Looney's

1029
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,567
And there's only one connection that they have

1030
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
Which is that

1031
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Growing number of people

1032
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
Are realizing that the system we have

1033
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
Is f****** up and it's killing

1034
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
And

1035
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,463
The Republican lunatics who are trying to destroy the GOP establishment want to kill for

1036
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,071
They're doing it they understand the reality that she actually has

1037
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
2 Chainz

1038
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
Really fat

1039
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
We can't we can't allow it to to do this

1040
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Yeah

1041
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
That is something that I do have in common with them in that I do also realize

1042
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
That

1043
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,175
Neoliberalism and neoconservatism

1044
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
Which are

1045
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
Essentially

1046
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
With slightly different cultural value

1047
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Brave

1048
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,879
Leading to the end of the world

1049
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
Agree

1050
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,143
I was trying to make is that the idea of wrestling

1051
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Against

1052
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
A

1053
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
More robust

1054
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,287
Bigger Liberty Movement

1055
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,823
Is a scary Prospect

1056
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
You like trying to

1057
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Waiting again

1058
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Dumbass

1059
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
All right I think I disagree

1060
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
Well there's about

1061
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
A couple million people with

1062
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
5 million gun

1063
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
The take that up with you

1064
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,279
They are when you reveal

1065
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
How

1066
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
White supremacist

1067
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Does the GOP Act

1068
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Phileas

1069
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
The people who are theoretically in the

1070
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
Center

1071
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,519
Are going to rely are going to lean back towards

1072
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Oh

1073
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Nazis are bad

1074
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,895
Like all this is doing again is revealing

1075
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
How about early f***** up and racism

1076
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
The GOP has been

1077
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
Always

1078
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,807
Yeah it is not a new

1079
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,855
This is what people believe

1080
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Look

1081
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
Lynchings didn't stop

1082
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Big Dipper

1083
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
You know maybe maybe that

1084
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
It's they just changed for

1085
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,959
It's the same ship and twenty years ago

1086
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,287
Even though we theoretically had a more reasonable GOP

1087
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
It was still going on

1088
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
We just didn't talk

1089
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,919
I'm so now they're just revealing that their months

1090
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,991
I'm not disagreeing with you at all I'm just trying to figure out how to pay resident

1091
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:11,647
This investigation know if you've ever listened to anything I've ever said

1092
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,951
Thinking of like what's the best transition

1093
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:20,351
What's the word I'm going to use the only time he was after that 40 to 60

1094
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,751
Good speaking of something that's good

1095
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
I love you Dad

1096
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687

Obscure members of the Infowars

Would you like to make a guess

1101
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
Securities

1102
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Lamest

1103
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,207
Rainbows

1104
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,631
Whatever happened to your girl

1105
01:00:54,399 --> 01:01:00,543
Millie

1106
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
A barrier

1107
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,663
She's gone Into Obscurity though I haven't heard

1108
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Not yet

1109
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,783
In Florida for a bit with a grandma

1110
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
Oh I don't know

01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Hope she's alright

1112
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,231
We're getting we're getting a guest

John bowne

1117
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Make

1118
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
The worst

1119
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
Most

1120
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
Special Report

1121
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
And I'm going to clinicals

1122
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,343
Critically deconstruct it

1123
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:53,279
Buy f****** piece until there is no bone but no already left on these bones do you want me to

1124
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:59,167
Put Cthulhu here while you do that and then I'll just I'll just come back whenever you like of user feedback

1125
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,239
So here's how the the report starts out

1126
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:07,615
Has to do with this supposed Bolshevik Revolution that's coming up

1127
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,151
As we face

1128
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
The violence that

1129
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,551
Voice over

1130
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
It's important

1131
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
The Cedars Selinsky

1132
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,647
Tactics

1133
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
Coming up

1134
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
Title rules

1135
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,607
We can clearly see how the Whiskey's rules

1136
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
Are being applied

1137
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
So have you got the premise

1138
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:39,103
The Bolshevik Revolution

1139
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,455
Making their move in November is Alex's pitch to everybody

1140
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,183
Pikachu remix

1141
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Hydrilla

1142
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:00,607
Bun you scream icing fun phones

1143
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
So

1144
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
John Bonham

1145
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,263
Did he is it stalled Alyssa

1146
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
Yeah and then he shortened it

1147
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Crystalline

1148
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
Yes

1149
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
I am not a fan of

1150
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:18,783
Saul Alinsky is one of these guys who was like George Soros in terms of universal Boogeyman of the Liberty Movement

1151
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,623
The book called Rules for Radicals

1152
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
This johnbowne fella

1153
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
He thinks

1154
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
He's cracked

1155
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:34,655
The code about what's going to be happening at Isis Isis 6969

1156
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Hugo's through the rules

1157
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,591
Radicals

1158
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,663
He provides examples of a bunch of them

1159
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
That view Liberals are doing

1160
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
And I

1161
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
Would like to propose

1162
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,135
Versions that Infowars is actually doing

1163
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,695
In a more real way so you're the first rule

1164
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,071
Power is not what you have

1165
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:11,519
Enter anyone in the government

1166
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,295
Free speech

1167
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
Historically

1168
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,439
So that is a teacher at Dartmouth

1169
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
He goes in

1170
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,279
The gives a media appearances about an

1171
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
How's that clip demonstrate

1172
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,935
Power is in perception

1173
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
I don't believe you

1174
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,543
18 no point during that clip did he

1175
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
He claimed to have more power than he

1176
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,455
Kind of what Alex does

1177
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
All the nearest clip from last week

1178
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,207
This is from a law-enforcement source

1179
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
Information

1180
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,215
FBI HRT

1181
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
And I found

1182
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,823
Information in the room

1183
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,223
So he did not kill himself the FBI hostage rescue team killing

1184
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
Delete this information

1185
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
All I'm saying is

1186
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
So

1187
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:13,119
Clip last week basically rolls his eyes

1188
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
Perception

1189
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,615
You just want your enemies to pick that you have that information

1190
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,895
Do you are using

1191
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Larry Nichols

1192
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,295
Can you really blackmail the GOP

1193
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,343
No

1194
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
Number to never go out

1195
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Outside

1196
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
Quiz horse

1197
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,423
Racist Trump supporter

1198
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:53,055
Horse

1199
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,639
The police

1200
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,967
Administration have been increasingly intolerant

1201
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:06,623
So I don't understand how that works either for his example

1202
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:13,791
So if they were just

1203
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,375
Is stay within your expertise

1204
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Fair

1205
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,847
Alex

1206
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,711
Just constantly talks about the globalist and Things That No One Else really

1207
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,271
Nose is real or bruising

1208
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
He insisted that

1209
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
He is

1210
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
More knowledgeable than

1211
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:44,255
Many experts and climate change

1212
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
Even people who make Max

1213
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,351
Right who else

1214
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:53,727
Speak like three languages also like like he just has his own

1215
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,775
He has his own world did he lose them

1216
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
Inside

1217
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
All of the narrative

1218
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,663
Whenever their guests are on who are like

1219
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
You don't get along with him

1220
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
He doesn't

1221
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,783
Drift too far outside of whatever is singing

1222
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,111
Racine open interviews haven't gone well he doesn't engage with me

1223
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
Things that are necessarily outside of it

1224
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,743
Number three

1225
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
We have real

1226
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
So I

1227
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,215
We have real

1228
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:30,591
No that's just as I was accidentally

1229
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,943
Year is

1230
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
Air assault

1231
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:46,719
U.s. code

1232
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
So

1233
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,263
Alright Eddie Bravo people are going to know what that is

1234
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:06,175
Other people

1235
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
Hellfire club

1236
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:14,111
And stuff like that if you don't know what he's talking about you're not going to be able to engage with it

1237
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,183
Globalist narratives are exactly Express

1238
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
Rule number three

1239
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,999
Rule Number Four

1240
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,535
Number for

1241
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
He does that all the time I have solutely

1242
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,055
I even when it's not too here's where I ran out of time before the show and I don't have clip to demonstrate all of these

1243
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,383
But you are watching the show

1244
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
Yeah they use real five

1245
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Number 5

1246
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
Ridicule is man's most potent

1247
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,767
So I don't

1248
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,679
That was Kennedy former MTV VJ Kennedy interviewing the guy who's on the left I guess

1249
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
I don't understand I mean like I don't know if that's

1250
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:08,383
Ridicule are they Immortal might just be a snippy,

1251
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,431
Is Shiva

1252
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:16,831
No the guy is the liberal

1253
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Indulgence

1254
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:24,255
Archetypical c*********

1255
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,047
He does voices to be Isaac

1256
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,863
BBC Alba to all the time

1257
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,447
He does nothing but ridicule people because he has no

1258
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
Did he can really stay in

1259
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
Here's rule sticks

1260
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
A good

1261
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
Is 1 Europe

1262
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
People enjoy

1263
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,919
Urgent

1264
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,295
Dear friends

1265
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,647
What is 13130 fastest USA

1266
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:56,767
Example

1267
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,631
Before

1268
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,727
Call Jeff's if we got to get him

1269
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,287
Lincoln the movie

1270
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,103
Pain in your audience

1271
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,431
Bill Clinton is a rapist on TV

1272
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,991
Indicative of

1273
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
You know

1274
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
Making your tactics

1275
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855
Appealing pierotti your tactics better

1276
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:27,743
Picking out people who break these rules seeing as how he has a lot of experience breaking

1277
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,191
He's made his tactics essentially just bullying anybody with

1278
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
Progressive

1279
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,031
And that's very appealing to his audience

1280
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
What are you doing

1281
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,175
Okay so when you chose those clips

1282
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Did he

1283
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Did he not

1284
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
Clips

1285
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
Because look

1286
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,599
I'm sure you could find some

1287
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:58,207
Google some clips of people saying dumb s*** like that

1288
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:03,071
Like it wouldn't even be that much better much better versions of liberals ridiculing people

1289
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
Pickard

1290
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,983
Just do anything that I do a rule 7

1291
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Number 7

1292
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:15,359
A tactic that drags on too long

1293
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,895
Don't be

1294
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,943
In the last week Alex Jones is

1295
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,759
Open pitching conspiracy theories about the Las Vegas

1296
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:28,159
I stopped but when it started to get boring you switched up into the LA

1297
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:33,791
He switched over in Tulsa

1298
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,631
Absolutely

1299
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:45,311
We talked about this all the f****** time like right but we do follow the next

1300
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
Keep the pressure on

1301
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,199
I would

1302
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:56,063
I would also like to suggest because he's still complaining about Hillary Clinton all the flying time

1303
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,855
So you

1304
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,135
These working with this rule

1305
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,695
So it was real nice

1306
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,511
Every time

1307
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
They

1308
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
Do you want to Saul Alinsky

1309
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,655
Everybody has to drink all right

1310
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
Number nine

1311
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,543
The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself

1312
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
I would argue that Larry Nichols threatening to Blackmail Congress

1313
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:25,503
Is on hundred percent that Alex Jones also threatened

1314
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,855
Like all sorts of secret information all this stuff

1315
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,903
So number 10

1316
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,535
Is the development of operation

1317
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
Is that will maintain a constant pressure

1318
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Opposition

1319
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,423
I don't think John Brown knows what that means

1320
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,567
Alarm

1321
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
Nothing

1322
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
So I

1323
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Number 11

1324
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:00,319
If you push the negative hard enough it will push through and become a positive

1325
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,975
The Publix sympathizes with the underdog

1326
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
I would argue that

1327
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
You would say

1328
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Vivid

1329
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
Antifa getting sympathy

1330
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,215
You could make easily the same argument

1331
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Your

1332
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:26,431
Yeah beat up all the time

1333
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,039
You know what I mean

1334
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,623
Okay now you're a Nazi until proven otherwise if you're on the

1335
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:40,511
I was already there

1336
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
UK it's a two-way street

1337
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:51,007
It goes both ways my friend up with this special report

1338
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,799
So here's a real 12

1339
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Number 12

1340
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
The price of a

1341
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
Is a constructive alternative

1342
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
Because you're caught

1343
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
Without a solution to the problem

1344
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
I would argue that they're not great at that

1345
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:14,559
Let's clean that sort of stuff

1346
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
They have a fake version

1347
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:23,775
But anything you would have a solution for it wouldn't be true

1348
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Number 13

1349
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,175
Guitar

1350
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Personalizing

1351
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,927
White people

1352
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
I would argue that

1353
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,583
Most of the time Alex Jones assaying the globalist

1354
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
How to kill your family

1355
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:58,079
Break your kids and take them out of your backyard I think that's personalizing

1356
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:02,175
Greco's commercial

1357
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,111
Maybe we should just go through the psychopath test and

1358
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,183
Just be like

1359
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,887
Millions of dollars make a better Special Report anyone who's thinking

1360
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Just be right through that

1361
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
That

1362
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,983
One of the rules

1363
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
Like it isn't that

1364
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
One of the rules is

1365
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,895
Ridiculing your enemy strength

1366
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,223
So pulling up

1367
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Rarity

1368
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,343
But isn't that exactly what that is

1369
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,743
Like leaning directly into it because that's the same bulshit that we've been dealing with all along

1370
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Alex is like

1371
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,583
Whatever it is they say we're doing is what they're doing

1372
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,447
I told of course you go right into the s*** that you like all they really need

1373
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
To do

1374
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Is

1375
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:58,751
Go through

1376
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,823
What would like a list of the ship that they do

1377
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,127
And just claim that the other side is doing it

1378
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,063
The other thing I would like to say is that the argument that I intended to

1379
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,391
To weave this kid kids should not watch the ship

1380
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Gloria

1381
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,815
The argument that I had hoped to sort of transition this to is

1382
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Does ask you a question

1383
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,471
What do you think the enemy

1384
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
Alex is using

1385
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,335
Cuz I would posit

1386
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
It's his audience

1387
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151
If not the globalist

1388
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,967
Look at the roof

1389
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,015
Right but look at the rules

1390
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,111
Power is not what you have it's what you appear to have

1391
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
He only appears

1392
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
To have this sort of

1393
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Fake

1394
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,999
Secretive information

1395
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,559
Who is audience who is bought into all of it

1396
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Globalist

1397
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,399
Or the people in power don't actually believe Alex Jones

1398
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
The only time he shows up in

1399
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,311
The news

1400
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
Making of Fame

1401
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:07,871
Claymore

1402
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,919
Play some gumball shadow

1403
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
You know all of that stuff

1404
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,247
Stay inside your expertise exactly

1405
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,551
He does with his audience

1406
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,111
Call him on it like what the

1407
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Sandy Hook bulshit

1408
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,439
You just go outside of their expert

1409
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
Using text well look

1410
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
That whole thing

1411
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
Make the enemy lives up to its own rules

1412
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,287
If you believe in Liberty

1413
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,103
We're the only ones who were fighting for your money

1414
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,943
Ridiculing I think it's a little more subtle I think they're making fun of Their audience

1415
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
Just buy

1416
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,527
Impaired vision

1417
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
Make a Rattata tactics

1418
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,647
Appeal to your audience really never let

1419
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,255
Threats work without follow-through he always teases. That never comes up

1420
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,303
Image entire episode

1421
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,839
Listen I'm going to get through

1422
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
All of these articles

1423
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
I've got 100

1424
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
Sheets of paper

1425
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,239
We're going to get through everything

1426
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,311
Create constant pressure he does that all the time

1427
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,711
A negative getting beat up is actually a positive right

1428
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
YouTube censorship

1429
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,319
And oppression women

1430
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,135
She is there on air

1431
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:27,743
Affected all the time anyway

1432
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,559
Though he says important things that allows Larry Nichols

1433
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
To commit a felony on the air

1434
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
Push back on it

1435
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:42,591
Well we kind of made him we were more asking him if that's what he was actually doing

1436
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
You know all of these right now

1437
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
And then he makes a purse

1438
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,575
Haha

1439
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
His audience is his enemy

1440
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,439
He's using the whatever these Saul Alinsky

1441
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
Tactics are

1442
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Against

1443
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Thank you

1444
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,535
Write solinsky eye

1445
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
Dammit

1446
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
So

1447
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Here we go

1448
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
We're done with the John bowne

1449
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,775
And I apologize for making people listen to his terrible voice

1450
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,848
Garbage but it is extra

1451
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,968
He gets into some trouble news and it's incredibly scary outside of Infowars

1452
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
Emporia's f****** scary

1453
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
What is a stripe

1454
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,208
Posture here

1455
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,352
Also criticizing Trump

1456
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
This is about the compass fermentation

1457
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:07,072
Military post

1458
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,312
Hey I just made it

1459
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,432
The idea that

1460
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,504
Days ago he is saying this is the Calm before the

1461
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
The storm

1462
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Indicates

1463
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,600
He's going to do something

1464
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,904
Going to see a nuclear weapon

1465
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,976
I only think it's possible if we do it

1466
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Exactly

1467
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,328
I think that

1468
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,120
Very possible that Trump is

1469
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
Nuclear warhead

1470
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,984
I think it's more likely that I want it

1471
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:49,312
But the others are asking

1472
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
Like you'll find out is

1473
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
Is Bucking

1474
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:56,224
That's a threat that's right like that's not a

1475
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
Yeah that's f***** up

1476
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,136
That really terrifies me anyways I'm

1477
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
Incredibly

1478
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Uncomfortable

1479
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
So remember earlier

1480
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
Not sexy

1481
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Really boring

1482
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
. sex

1483
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:17,216
Alex gets deeper into that about

1484
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,776
But then Alex makes

1485
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,312
Startling admission

1486
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Pretty sure it makes him.

1487
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
But we already knew

1488
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
Show

1489
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:32,320
Infowars

1490
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:40,768
About delivering

1491
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
Myself

1492
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,680
6 months ago

1493
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,472
His plan got Pitch

1494
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
Through

1495
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
Gino's

1496
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,104
Horsey first put out planet

1497
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,640
About the funding

1498
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,456
And Anna

1499
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:03,552
He's talked about Obamacare we went over this in detail and up episode like

1500
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,832
Six months ago or so

1501
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,904
Freddy

1502
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,952
True there's money that came from

1503
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
As if I got it money in the government

1504
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,144
Jerome corsi

1505
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
Apparently

1506
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,984
Is lobbying in

1507
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
In Washington

1508
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,056
That's

1509
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Not

1510
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
Good

1511
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,664
That's not yet don't you want your news Outlet

1512
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,224
Also lobbying for you

1513
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,528
No

1514
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Celavi for you

1515
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:40,672
No cuz they have your best interest at heart

1516
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,280
That doesn't sound like human nature at all I don't know they're all altruistic

1517
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:50,144
Especially whenever it's a corporation

1518
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,752
If Alex Jones was trying to successfully lobbying the government

1519
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
And he got his way

1520
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
They would have liked

1521
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,592
The school lunch program will be gone

1522
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:04,480
It'll be replaced with super male Vitality Licor caveman the caveman for all the kids

1523
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,880
Oh by the way I can't get audio of this commercial cuz it only plays during the live things commercial to cut out

1524
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:15,744
From what I end up taking eclipse from straight-up commercial for caveman

1525
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,072
Where he blamed caveman or give credit

1526
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,912
Free son going through puberty

1527
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,472
Well don't you want that in our elementary schools

1528
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
So I guess

1529
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,616
I'm up earlier than humans

1530
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,896
Is that what we want to be again

1531
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
I guess those

1532
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
Classic mailbox

1533
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,600
It's showing how

1534
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:47,232
Because the president

1535
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:51,072
Tomorrow

1536
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
Article

1537
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
Vicodin

1538
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,104
Paul healthcare plan

1539
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,992
And it's got the whole plan

1540
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
Even if I don't get rid of the whole building

1541
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
Itself

1542
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,024
Quality Care

1543
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,304
So I can do any of that

1544
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,096
This is sad

1545
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
This we're back back again

1546
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288
Does he really believe that

1547
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
I don't know

1548
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
That one

1549
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,384
That one is one that he really believes

1550
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
Mainly because I don't

1551
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,200
Understand how that way

1552
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
First off

1553
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,040
He doesn't understand that the insurance

1554
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Industry

1555
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,600
Is ultimately socialized

1556
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,184
Like he doesn't get that the entirety of it is

1557
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
You pay

1558
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
Even though you're not sick

1559
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,072
Because people who are sick will use that money

1560
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
And if you get sick

1561
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,656
The people who aren't sick are going to

1562
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,520
Give that money to you in order for you but there's just a corporation skimming off the top

1563
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,592
Yeah right there

1564
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,872
If you get rid of

1565
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,640
Those

1566
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
Directions

1567
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Then

1568
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
The corporation won't skip

1569
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
The money off the top

1570
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
But what he doesn't understand is that it's the reverse

1571
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:19,136
Where's Camelot more

1572
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,928
He's dumb

1573
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
They are stupid versus evil

1574
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:28,096
Continue in the dump

1575
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,376
But also

1576
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,704
I don't think I think he's a sociopath so he doesn't know how to laugh

1577
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,288
I think the most likely thing is that he is dumb

1578
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:42,944
Do the alignment is naturally evil has a baseline of evil even when he's being dumb

1579
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,736
I think that's possible

1580
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,528
Anyway it is next cliff

1581
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,416
Yeah in your in your Dungeons and Dragons like nine things right there

1582
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:55,744
It's not lawful evil or chaotic evil or neutral evil

1583
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,104
University of New Brunswick

1584
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
Saint Valentine

1585
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:21,600
What's happening is they're less sexually active now on

1586
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
And so

1587
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:25,184
I see all this online that's what a relationship is

1588
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,840
Just read about that

1589
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
Psychological studies

1590
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:42,336
Let's continue

1591
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,664
Play buried boy

1592
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:52,064
I think this is a new a new addition to the drinking game room is Alex Jones

1593
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,344
Done something sexual

1594
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,928
That's

1595
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,976
What are you talkin about

1596
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,768
Get the f*** out of here with that

1597
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,680
A lot of fun I enjoy enjoy that clips

1598
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,984
But that's a good example of what

1599
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,264
Trying to get through the news

1600
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,592
No

1601
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:20,992
Analysis style is

1602
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,880
But actually being with him in Broad

1603
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,928
Terrible forklift last

1604
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
And we get into a fight

1605
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,032
Search somebody

1606
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
Statistics came out today about crime

1607
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
Extra read all of them

1608
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
Who's presenting on this

1609
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,992
Solve this crime as black people

1610
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:58,368
I haven't looked at it but my gut tells me he's not being accurate

1611
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,904
That's just my feeling

1612
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,952
Percentage-wise

1613
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
If I was a betting man right

1614
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:07,328
I bet on you I'm fine not knowing entirely at this point

1615
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
Because

1616
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,656
This is going to come back up on a future show

1617
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,728
I'll get some research by then so for now

1618
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
Tentatively

1619
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,568
Strongly disagree without

1620
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,896
But this place was worth keeping in just because I even

1621
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,944
Even without knowing anything about with us

1622
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
He's talking about

1623
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,992
Greenfield

1624
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,344
Use white people

1625
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
Because they hype up

1626
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,424
The few questionable

1627
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,496
As if it's the end of the world

1628
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
Blooded

1629
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:55,200
Call Sugar Mama

1630
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:58,784
Caveman with the bone broth

1631
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,136
With the tumeric the chaga mushroom or the other concentrated things like

1632
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,744
What a piece of s***

1633
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
What are

1634
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
Piece of garbage

1635
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,352
Have you even heard

1636
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:15,168
From the New Black

1637
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
No

1638
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,496
No

1639
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
And also

1640
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
Look

1641
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:24,384
Neither of those two are advocating for killing White

1642
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,688
I am

1643
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:31,552
Alex goes along with his narrative

1644
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,600
Freaked out white people who are doing it

1645
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,928
Well I mean yeah that's me

1646
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:42,048
I will be fine if you picked me as a boogeyman

1647
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:48,448
11th grade

1648
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:53,568
Like you called him left a message that multiple people called him and told him to call you

1649
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:58,432
That's weird

1650
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:03,552
The house phone number from before

1651
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,368
The guy who called me about Alex that one time up

1652
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,464
Seriously

1653
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:16,352
Cuz it is if you wants to talk again tomorrow then I want to make sure that we actually do have

1654
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,656
I can wing it cuz I got a lot to ask

1655
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:21,472
Okay tell me more about Linda bloodworth-thomason

1656
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
He can't hear you

1657
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,312
No

1658
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,848
No you have to talk

1659
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
I need to go buy a new cord

1660
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:37,344
Right

1661
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,952
So today Alex is stupid

1662
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,256
He's convoluting this that Las Vegas narrative

1663
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,560
The point where you can't even keep track what's going on

1664
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
Do you have

1665
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,864
Totally real sources

1666
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,424
John bowne sucks at doing his job

1667
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
I mean

1668
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
You know what

1669
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,752
Sitting there at work today

1670
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
John Boehner

1671
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Amazing

1672
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,616
His job is he's a Sleeper Cell

1673
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:06,016
Voice over

1674
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,808
The other side is doing

1675
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Crushed it

1676
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:13,696
It makes it obvious

1677
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,536
The thing that I came to when I was listening

1678
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,072
Today was just like

1679
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,120
This show is bad

1680
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,424
I know if it's like

1681
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:28,800
10 months into like a tent

1682
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,640
Studying for one of the first times

1683
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,200
Man I would like to get them in shape

1684
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:37,760
Take me to manager

1685
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:43,648
Yeah you know he's not going to fly right

1686
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,440
Do you think this report

1687
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,464
Is good enough

1688
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
Alex

1689
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Come on

1690
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:54,656
You got to make these less transparent moves

1691
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,312
Your main problem with the show today

1692
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:07,712
Is it wasn't slick enough know really any other problem it was a

1693
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,296
One of the first times that really got my head does like they need a program

1694
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:17,952
Thought process was like

1695
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Look

1696
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,280
This dude is good at what he does

1697
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
I think he's bad I think he's evil I stand behind a lot of that not today no way man

1698
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:34,080
What he does in terms of like

1699
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,640
Being slippery of yelling on a bike

1700
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:41,760
But I don't think he's good at what he does in terms of running the entire operation

1701
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,600
How much Buckley is doing

1702
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
Behind the scenes

1703
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,720
More people better behind the scenes

1704
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:55,072
The inevitable

1705
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:57,120
Issue with that right and it's

1706
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,144
The same thing with Trump

1707
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:05,568
He is except like what Trump is a horrible evil psychopath is going to get us all killed

1708
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,360
As far as

1709
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
That guy getting elected

1710
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,688
He has to be good at f******

1711
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,968
Can something right

1712
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,992
He's very playful

1713
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,320
If you're not an

1714
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,624
Idiot you know you don't want to work with

1715
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:26,816
The only people that will work with him

1716
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,888
A bright-eyed

1717
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
Young

1718
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Competent

1719
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,472
Program director

1720
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:41,920
Secret

1721
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,624
Outlet

1722
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
I mean

1723
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,440
If I were trouble I would be

1724
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Kind of ashamed

1725
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
The sloppiness of it

1726
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,024
And here's

1727
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,520
I accidentally watched a little bit of the real news with David Knight

1728
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,312
And he boring is s***

1729
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,616
He doesn't have the skills that Alex has

1730
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,408
But the show is

1731
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
Much better produce

1732
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:18,784
Haha David Knight doesn't freak out and lose his place and thing

1733
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,088
Whatever he does the ads

1734
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,624
They're very

1735
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,416
Kemp's ice cream

1736
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:27,744
They're a little more classy in terms of how he gets into them

1737
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,048
He always knows

1738
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,608
Commercials are coming up he's never caught off guard

1739
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,424
You never the middle of screaming before commercial

1740
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
He's a boring

1741
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
But competent broadcast

1742
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,800
At least in terms of like what is

1743
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
Acceptable brought

1744
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
He's a game manager

1745
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
Right

1746
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:50,016
General Star pro wrestling fans out there

1747
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:53,344
But like are you at the same time I understand

1748
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
Alex Jones

1749
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
Alex Jones would not be what

1750
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,440
He is

1751
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
If you was

1752
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,536
Bad

1753
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:04,864
Corso is it is this it's this classic

1754
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
Paradox

1755
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
The crazy man theory of foreign policy though

1756
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,848
Is that a

1757
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,128
An unhinged Act

1758
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,944
Is somebody that is far more threat

1759
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,272
If you have a Nixon in there it's like

1760
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,832
I'm more afraid of America cuz I have no f******

1761
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
Conclude with that guys go

1762
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,624
Going to do

1763
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,280
That kind of next year I will be working at Infowars and you will have a

1764
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,072
Gun

1765
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,912
And then you wouldn't grab

1766
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Listen

1767
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:45,056
I would pass a background check but I can't have a gun because I have a history of mental illness and

1768
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
My medication

1769
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
Is working perfectly

1770
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:51,968
Perfectly right now but I can't have one history issue

1771
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,248
I want

1772
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,296
On my on my

1773
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,112
Because it's too it's too terrifying

1774
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,928
Cuz it's a button

1775
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:01,952
It's a button

1776
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,816
It's a big thing that has kept me

1777
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:11,168
From killing myself in the past has always been that it would be a lot of

1778
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
Lack of access

1779
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,008
Hassle

1780
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,360
Great great way to put it for a national Mental Health Group

1781
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:22,944
A lot of the time one of the big like you would have to take a

1782
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,016
Depart my Razor to get the razor blades out

1783
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,296
Be a lot of work and you can't

1784
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,320
Something

1785
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,440
So I did

1786
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,024
Mental Health Awareness Day

1787
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,560
I did

1788
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
Attempt

1789
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,120
To jump

1790
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:48,288
And that did not go well

1791
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
My railing

1792
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,088
Every some reason either

1793
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
Jump to it

1794
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,392
The context of in front of

1795
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,184
Karura

1796
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:11,584
Which in retrospect is like

1797
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,144
Come on man that's not going to work

1798
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,992
National

1799
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
Mental Health

1800
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,184
Having these sorts of things in your pasta is okay it doesn't mean you're broken you can't get better there

1801
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,976
Please help absolutely

1802
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
And

1803
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,144
I don't know why

1804
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,568
I just think that they big

1805
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Sing is

1806
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
Keep trying

1807
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
I just because I've gone through a bunch

1808
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,504
Keep On Keepin On

1809
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
Time I would never have actually

1810
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,624
I got onto the meds that I'm on now and they work perfect

1811
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:11,488
Any

1812
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,840
Failure or setback

1813
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,864
In terms of progress

1814
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,144
Does evidence that progress

1815
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,936
Isn't going to happen always impossible

1816
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,472
You're setting yourself up for math

1817
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
You know

1818
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,592
It's very attractive to do that but

1819
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Weird way to end

1820
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,200
Weird weather at

1821
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,760
You know someone who I wish would stop price

1822
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:40,160
Floor balcony

1823
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:51,424
Himself

1824
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:59,360
He has right before the number of it

1825
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Alex

1826
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,600
In color
