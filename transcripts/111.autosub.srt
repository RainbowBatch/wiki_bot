1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:14,336
I love your work

2
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,736
I'd like to sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:26,880
If you were going to sell somebody on the show you wouldn't just be like

4
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
5

5
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
You're the worst yes 100 hist

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
Naruto

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Paneer like

8
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
Nah f*** you I know what I was doing

9
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,944
Space station middle finger

10
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
By 3

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Amen Chicago

12
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
The middle finger to the or we would like to ram

13
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm giving the middle finger

14
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Space command spider leadership middle finger right there

15
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,936
We don't even have a middle finger

16
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,752
Now you got a middle leg

17
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
Star one truth

18
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Larry 21st and 22nd episodes 2016

19
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay it was January 21st

20
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
What's wrong time it is not we are in December

21
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Trip into the past

22
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,664
We're coming up on about a year of doing the show we probably probably have another week or so after this

23
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Love you two weeks

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Bumblebee out of town for Christmas I believe

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
You son-of-a-b**** my brother

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Hey there will be out of that

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
Play a computer and be like

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
What do we do

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
What the f***

30
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
Typically what are we doing

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,456
But I wanted to I wanted to take a second because it's easy to get caught up in how terrible things are in a

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Another world

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Is a Mastiff

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
I was thinking scary

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
Agreed

36
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Separate second step back in and really

37
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
I think we need to recognize a Vic

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Did we have

39
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
I believe

40
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
We've done

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
I believe that we've gotten to the bottom of Alex Jones

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Like not the big picture but in terms of trump

43
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
I really think

44
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,944
But we have explored this in a way that no other organization has done

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
Completed

46
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,880
A remarkable feat of Journalism

47
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Redundant

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Yeah the redundancies kind of reinforced

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Episode

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
I'll bring a full-circle

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
I think

52
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
I didn't think a year ago when we started this to like

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
You're the one in 11 months will sit down and we'll have a pretty

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Pretty good handle on what

55
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
And I think we do

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
It's pretty clear spiders

57
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Absolutely

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Spiders

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm getting uncomfortable even in this moment because I'm saying positive stuff about us

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Also you should not be saying us

61
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
You did a great job you're you're giving me

62
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,728
Credit for journalistic activities way off

63
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
A couple of our listeners also have been very collaborative

64
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,384
In terms of finding things out

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
Bouncing ideas off of

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,368
Sell yourself short

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Thank you

68
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
But I think

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
I don't feel a ton of

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Not into

71
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Interest isn't the right word

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,727
I don't see what ton of curiosity about Alex Jones and Donald Trump

73
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
Where is when we started that was something that really motivated

74
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,639
Mystery that we need to solve

75
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
And to the extent that we've been able to figure out that

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Alex Jones

77
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Had

78
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
A

79
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Underlying Allegiant

80
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
That existed

81
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,231
Before Donald Trump ever got involved victim of an influencer

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
Campaign we're in Russian Bots and play the traffic

83
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
I'm confused

84
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
Right and at the same time Rodger Stone

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Steve pieczenik

86
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
We're lying to

87
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Manipulating

88
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
With

89
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Friendly narratives

90
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
To get him to join up

91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
The whole story

92
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Really I think

93
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
What's what's big stuff like that fear

94
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
You have exactly the concoction that you need

95
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
To get him into the position he's in now

96
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
And it's not really all that interesting

97
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
To me anymore

98
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
Trying to sit down and think

99
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Think about like

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
What can be

101
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,447
You know what is as we go into year 2

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
I don't know exactly what shape that's going to

103
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
And granted when we started the show

104
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
It was a couple months before we started getting it

105
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
2015

106
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,807
I don't feel a ton of pressure but I think one of the things I'm going to do is I'm going to do

107
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Much more work on Alex's

108
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
Is primary sources

109
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,231
Okay I believe that one of the one of the guiding principles of your two is going to

110
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
To be debunking

111
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
The things that he

112
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
He uses as

113
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
The

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
What would you take Keystone's and his ark

115
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Yes the way stones that we've used before that he keeps going back to Auburn.

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,383
Penguin

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
You're talking about Robert David Steals and not even that cuz that goes crazy

118
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
I will actually say that another thing I'm going to be doing in year 2

119
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
He's getting much more in-depth about the

120
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Contributors

121
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,815
Yeah people like Robert about the Nation of Islam

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
My point is I guess I don't know what I'm doing but I don't know what I'm saying but I wanted

123
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Your point is we're having a production meeting as we speak or Alex production meeting

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,087
Victory I believe

125
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
In terms of

126
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Sorting out Alex Jones's Journey 2

127
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
Lower my glass

128
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
In recognition of a New Journey to come

129
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,911
And I'm not sure exactly what it's going to be but it'll be something devastating

130
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,727
Thank you so now it's 26

131
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Bilbo Baggins eleventy hundred

132
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
May 11th

133
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
From blow it could be like that thing from the window is

134
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Yes January

135
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
2016

136
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Alex Jones

137
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Brookshire

138
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
Alex has already switched over to Trump

139
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
In the middle to end of December of 2015

140
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
Rodger stone is shown up as more frequent contributor

141
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
And Alex has said as much as

142
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
It's Trump or die

143
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
And he's drifted away from politics

144
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Text a little bit

145
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,407
He's drifted into some alot more of his cultural narratives

146
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
And stuff like that

147
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,271
The end of January

148
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Little bit of trouble

149
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
And

150
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
And that way I don't interrupt you and frustrate you

151
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
So I'm going to get there before you start the transition

152
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
That's what I've learned over this 11 months

153
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Do you think

154
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
And just like from what we know

155
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,407
Has Rodger Stone ever gotten drunk

156
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
And tried to make his Richard

157
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Nixon tattoo talk to people yes

158
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,087
Of course right that wasn't like he's moved his shoulders

159
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Tried to make its mouth

160
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,463
Right I mean the things that I started to learn about Rodger Stone

161
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,119
Taken is red implied that

162
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
It's insane to think that he was

163
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
I don't judge him for being a libertine or anything like that but like

164
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Which

165
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
What was what was out there

166
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
There's no way you can try to make a tattoo

167
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Next question

168
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
He got fired from a campaign was Reagan

169
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Because

170
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
He got caught

171
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,695
Trying to solicit a well-hung to swing with him and his wife in a newspaper

172
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
I feel like that's not an issue I don't care if you did I don't do what you want to do

173
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,191
He said that it wasn't him it's someone else's prank and then later

174
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,823
Own up to but you know what I'm saying

175
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Second Quest

176
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Have you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer

177
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
So the climax of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

178
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
Has us discovering that Voldemort

179
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
Has been living inside of Professor

180
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
His head is like out the back

181
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
His head right so the face in front

182
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,935
I get what you're trying to say here is Richard Nixon still alive

183
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
In the tattoos

184
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Relevant

185
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
M5 Road

186
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
Maybe four I don't remember the one where the carnival comes around

187
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
My girl can make prophetic tattoos on people

188
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,391
Was reasonable anyway let's start with an out-of-context drop

189
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Inside

190
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,047
Weber

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,703
We know after I'm dead

192
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
He's going to go swim.

193
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,639
Discrete episodes

194
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Buy a bolt of lightning

195
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Died

196
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Rosegal

197
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Fly

198
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Saliva every

199
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
Episodes that are very distinct

200
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
In character

201
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
The first episode is full of

202
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Graphic live

203
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,143
And the second episode January 22nd

204
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Impersonal

205
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
21st

206
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:53,055
Very specific narrative that I think he exposes himself on

207
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Real hard

208
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
The confrontation of a caller

209
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
Interesting breakdown to do there

210
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,319
Who's got to start always chronologically no jumping around

211
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,671
Mix up Alex's words and make him seem like he's saying something you didn't say

212
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
Except for data projects.

213
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Where to start with China Wok

214
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Start with a

215
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
January 21st

216
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
6000 super class in the world

217
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
This is I just give you some context Alex 6000

218
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
He said this

219
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Yeah he said that he believes that the ranks of the globalist thereabouts

220
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
6000 globalist Witness

221
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,423
Is what you're saying only 6,000 going to get home

222
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
They think they're on a higher level than they actually are

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
It's going to get worse

224
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
Rothschild

225
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
And then say they have half the wealth of the planet

226
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Can you do

227
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
The numbers I forget was it

228
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,631
000000000000

229
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Still mathematically

230
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Cut that Walton app

231
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Batman

232
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
Divide that number 6,000

233
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Percentage point to 1%

234
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
Are the people that own a big boat at the harbor

235
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
They're the folks that build company

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Just like

237
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,295
Now they're down to about a third of what they were in the 50s

238
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Daniel

239
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Percentage

240
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
So

241
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
I don't

242
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
I think this was going to make you really mad

243
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
Frustrating word problem in geometry

244
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,087
Like that's what I'm really struggling with

245
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
If 6000 people are on a train going from the global Empire to f****** America how many

246
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,791
Give them will ruin the Renaissance

247
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
He's talking about

248
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Bright

249
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Instinct

250
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
You know what Alex's

251
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Vista

252
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Like the fifties it's is the 50's oldies did the Billionaire's have only shot up

253
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:13,247
He's right that the middle class

254
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
Rolls let's say have dwindled people

255
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
Your f****** world could make the argument that the middle class

256
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Realistically has shrunk

257
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,375
But you can't really say that the upper class has

258
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Shrunk there's more

259
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Consolidation

260
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Nintendo

261
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
This 1%

262
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Urners

263
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,687
Learners heavy quotation the first against the wall when the revolution

264
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,015
But that's not you have a boat Alex

265
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Boat

266
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Good routes has multiple reference

267
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
The Renaissance

268
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,143
People who are other examples are like

269
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
They have

270
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Haircut

271
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,079
Stuff like that

272
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
The rest of us can't put her kid

273
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
School no

274
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
To be considered in one

275
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Percent

276
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Millions of dollars

277
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
But that's not middle class

278
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
He likes to present those like if you make $100,000 a year in the 1%

279
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
Where is the cutoff far away from that as you might imagine

280
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
It's in the million

281
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,239
I don't think 1%

282
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Something like that

283
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,591
Like because

284
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
Like Millions suggest to me like

285
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Larger than

286
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
Will the difficulty to comes into like net worth vs

287
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Is fluid worth

288
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
Accessible capital

289
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
But be that as it may. It's not people who are like

290
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Just have a good job and get their haircut that's not

291
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
The issue

292
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
He's conflating all sorts of things brilliant

293
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Say

294
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Because then your listeners

295
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
If you go

296
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Put people put their kids

297
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
Is there school in

298
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
They're like well

299
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
I do that

300
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
So I'm in the top 14

301
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Right

302
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
I want policies that support the top 1%

303
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,607
Tuesday are and then you discover no I have been for the past 40

304
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
Thousand f****** yeah it's kind of a fun shell game

305
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
In some ways but

306
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Sing to me anytime

307
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
Someone is like no no no no no

308
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
No no

309
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Those really rich people

310
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
There's a Renaissance

311
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,903
Every f****** little piece of lifeblood out of this goddamn Planet they

312
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
They can before they suck

313
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Die and leave the rest

314
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
So Alex is a lot of thoughts about like

315
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
The times being better in the past

316
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,215
Yeah but it's real fun to remember that right now

317
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
Do you have no Roy Moore

318
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Probably going to win this week

319
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,663
Haven't come out and literally said times were better in slavery days

320
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Like you know

321
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Just making

322
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
What's up text

323
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,439
Ultimate ultimate truths of

324
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Trump's election is just

325
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
Why were we talked with Mike

326
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Subtlety is

327
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
Has to be like

328
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Counterculture

329
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
The race

330
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,711
Some extent I know just take bravery to be an out-and-out racist

331
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,063
You should die in public eyebrow to evolve them

332
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
So here I ears is measured of

333
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
Here's where Alex Jones Harkens back to the past again

334
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
In a very weird way

335
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,887
America's Best Picture

336
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Mary Tyler Moore

337
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
Young and devastating

338
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
But I digress

339
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
Do you take pictures of

340
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,831
Mary Tyler Moore and put them up next to pictures of Lee Ann McAdoo

341
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
If there's any pretty similar look in the two of them

342
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
They have they have a lot of facial similarities

343
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Okay so

344
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
It's interesting I'm going to go I'm going to go off the picture that is on the only picture I've ever seen of Lee Ann McAdoo

345
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Is the one that you actually

346
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
They just posted on on the website

347
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Let me tell you something

348
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
There's one huge difference between Mary Tyler Moore

349
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,599
Bringing her up in a hot woman licking the middle of his politically

350
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,975
His political shows

351
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,303
It leads me to believe there's literally no way he's never made a pass

352
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,703
Lexi looks a lot like Mary Tyler Moore Tyler Moore

353
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
And then just

354
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Right

355
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
No black people

356
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
Describe all the happiness of all the goodness

357
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
We've all been taught to fight with each other

358
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
I would like to pay women were on the right

359
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,335
This very important clarification

360
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,223
The entire storyline of Mary Tyler Moore with bio crazy it is but a woman

361
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,111
That was what they work together to figure out what the f*** was going wrong with women being allowed to work

362
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,927
Bewitched the entire story is about

363
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
Slave

364
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
B12

365
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
Domestically

366
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
I apologize for my

367
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,455
Compute my God what a great looking woman

368
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Still

369
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Illusion

370
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
We have all these regulations

371
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
We got screwed over was not trusting the system

372
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Is the government

373
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
We all remember those great Nick at Nite TV Land episodes where they question

374
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,103
Government

375
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,223
Mary Tyler Moore was got to get this fluoride out of the water

376
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,599
You do remember how

377
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
Military subplot in it

378
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Stupid

379
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,864
Those shows are the most Americana

380
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
Those are shows of the most reinforcing of the status quo

381
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Clear Asus Limoges

382
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,944
To the extent that it was about a woman going out on her own and

383
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
You know having a job in a male-dominated atmosphere

384
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
There's still a ton of

385
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
Is wet wood

386
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Some of it done

387
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Who played for

388
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Affect but at the same time

389
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,584
Ivan wellpet night

390
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,984
Never have been a character

391
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
In Illinois

392
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
About

393
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
God's country

394
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
However far away from Rockford

395
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
And before the show started

396
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,736
One of the people in the crowd was sitting at the bar crowd I say

397
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:18,624
7 people who sitting at the bar with his girlfriend or wife or whatever the f*** it was company for scrap

398
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Devereux

399
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
There is a lady, who neither get punched in the mouth

400
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,472
Sure any like okay great I hope you get

401
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
Murdered

402
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
I don't care you're the worst

403
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
That guy

404
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
It's 2017 that's the problem

405
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,992
Guns

406
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Especially not comedy problems

407
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
I don't like these jokes to punch that lady

408
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,952
We're living in

409
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,048
So this point where Alex's harking back to an imaginary past

410
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Existing misrepresented

411
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
He jumps over to

412
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
An interesting narrative that he throws around a lot

413
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Really taking the time to get into so we

414
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
We shall now

415
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,360
What about Alex's favorite animal

416
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
The try cops

417
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
We need to be angry we need to be upset we need to be in the system space thing we know you're criminals

418
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
Negotiate

419
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
There have been global

420
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
North American Union and other

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
Global confab

422
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,136
Agree to give China

423
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,512
Where is minerals worldwide that's why they get 90%

424
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Google

425
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:16,384
So whenever Alex's Google it that's my cue to look into something cuz you clearly lying about

426
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,968
Yeah so one of the things that's actually really interesting is that Alex

427
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
In the past

428
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,880
Was correcting its updated statistic but there was a time and fairly recent memory were

429
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
China was responsible for

430
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Heather hand in 97

431
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Percent of rare earth minerals

432
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Sales

433
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
The mark

434
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
Rare Earth minerals

435
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
They only had can

436
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Control over something

437
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
To the tune of 30% of the world's rarest men

438
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
There are mines in California Australia

439
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
All over the

440
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
But the issue is

441
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Those

442
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Mine

443
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
We're not

444
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Feasible

445
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
We could very easily get our own Rare Earth minerals

446
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,136
From you know in California other places

447
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
Well that that is

448
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
It's so f******

449
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
King hard

450
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
To get rare earth minerals

451
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,424
And I don't understand it so then why would you call them

452
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
They're not that rare baby, it's a misnomer slightly overweight or because of

453
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
The difficulty

454
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,200
And getting wonderful

455
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
It's just that there

456
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Want to get it out and make

457
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Commutable they become rich

458
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
But also the

459
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Razee polluting

460
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
It's

461
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
Stanley polluting

462
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
And for the last couple decades

463
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,280
China has much laxer environmental standards

464
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,096
For their businesses

465
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
As we

466
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Came into the Modern Age and the

467
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,264
EPA got strengthened underneath Clinton underneath bush

468
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
All destroyed prosperity

469
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
Write all of the president

470
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Have

471
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:58,528
You know boosted EPA that it's until currently it became a thing where it was just not

472
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Feasible

473
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
It wasn't worth it China was producing these things in a way that was environmentally unsound but they produce

474
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Such a way that we could buy all we need

475
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
It was no big deal

476
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
Let me explain to you hear this is from an article in Gizmodo

477
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,424
Where they get into the extraction of rare earth minerals

478
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
I'm going to read you

479
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
How you hack

480
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Have to get them out of the Earth

481
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Is going to be riveting

482
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,872
The first step in extracting rare-earth oxides from the surrounding rock is

483
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
Across the rocks and grind them into a fine powder

484
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
This is passed through a series of time

485
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Where the Rare Earth elements float to the top

486
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,368
Aren't you read this in the voice of like the Discovery Channel's how get made

487
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
Unwanted minerals picture the bottom

488
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
Hazardous waste material called

489
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
Healing is Santa ponsa

490
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
For storage

491
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Meanwhile the results

492
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,168
Concentrate a rare earth metal is roasted in Kilns and then dissolve

493
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
The fraction of the results

494
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Wash that contains Rare Earth

495
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
In the form of mixed metal oxide

496
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Is removed

497
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
Finally a solvent is neutralized

498
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
The reaction generates a lot of salt

499
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
When the

500
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
In California was running at full capacity in the 9th

501
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
1990

502
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
It produced as much as 800

503
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
50 gallons of

504
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
Salty Wastewater every minute

505
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Everyday of the

506
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
This waste was contained I also contain

507
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Radioactive

508
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Thorium and uranium

509
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
Which collected a scale inside the pipe

510
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
Deliver water to evaporate

511
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
Tampons 11 miles away

512
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Several times in the 1990

513
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Cleaning operation

514
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,568
Temperature remove the built-up scale cause the pipeline to

515
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
Worst spelling hundreds of thousands of gallons of hazardous waste

516
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
The desert

517
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
The state of California I ordered Molycorp

518
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,296
Which was the oil company

519
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
Molycorp Molycorp

520
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
Molycorp

521
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
They were really Malik

522
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
I would say so so they were ordered to clean up the white

523
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,872
In 2002 the company already struggling to make a profit ran out of space to store

524
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
And failed to secure a permit to build a new Storage Post

525
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
The mine shut down

526
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
It's just

527
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Ratably

528
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Hard

529
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,904
So what you just described to me

530
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
Even worse than fracking in the

531
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Keystone Pipeline

532
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,632
More like that you're saying that it's impossible to get all this s*** without killing all of that s***

533
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,704
That's basically what you described

534
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
So now this weather

535
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
In 2010

536
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
In September of 2010

537
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,016
There came on.

538
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
The China has control

539
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Almost all the trade

540
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Of these Rare Earth minerals

541
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
Uno from Trump's policies

542
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Monopolies are great

543
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,280
Will it work out well for everybody

544
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
No but also

545
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
Minerals are needed for component

546
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
And a lot of electronics

547
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,336
Some military hardware and stuff like that

548
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,456
There was a maritime like nickel and gold are some of the best things to put inside

549
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
That's why so many phones

550
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
Rare Earth minerals

551
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
More like you don't know the name

552
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
I had a list pulled up

553
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,632
I know those it's not Metals you ever heard of okay

554
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Death metal

555
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,128
Stuff like that.

556
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
Pittsburgh Kelly

557
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Dispute in September 2010

558
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Beautiful

559
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Japan

560
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
The captain of a Chinese fishing

561
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Controller which it collided with

562
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Do Japanese coastguard

563
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
China responded by announcing

564
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
All shipments of rare Earth elements

565
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
The Japan

566
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
We use the imported Metals in Federal Heights

567
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
So they used it like a big dick

568
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Right

569
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
Japan immediately release the Chinese fishing

570
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Captain fin York Times

571
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Declare that it was a humiliating Retreat for Tokyo

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
This point everybody started to get really scared

573
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,416
About the idea of the China Canal flout any rules

574
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
And the issue became

575
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,256
If we wanted to start extracting from

576
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,376
California or from the other countries that are much more friendly Ministry

577
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,192
The first

578
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:36,288
We would pollute the environment we pollute the environment

579
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,872
The report from the government accountability office born to quote

580
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,456
Rebuilding the u.s. rare earth supply chain may take up to 50

581
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
Azzurro became a thing where like

582
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
F*** China has this

583
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Massive

584
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,136
Weapon against us and Alex thinks that

585
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
The case right

586
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
It's not

587
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
And there's a number of read

588
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
It didn't work out

589
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
This whole

590
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
It was going to be able to

591
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,984
Restricted Supply in cut off all rare Earth elements to everywhere

592
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Aegis

593
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
It hasn't materialized

594
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
They haven't made these threats

595
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
And even the blockhead and

596
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Japan wooden

597
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
The word for a number of reasons

598
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
The first

599
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Is it there's tons of small mining Corporation

600
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Companies within China that aren't controlled by the state

601
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,440
That are operating fairly illegally

602
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
XSport

603
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Currently 20000 of 30,000

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
Tons of rare earth minerals every year

605
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
Which would be enough

606
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,448
For the United States to cover all of the things that they need

607
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Further

608
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
We really don't

609
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Much of it

610
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
And we have a bunch of

611
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,456
We've already bought

612
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Ever bright bright

613
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
We can recycle it affect

614
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
We just don't

615
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,928
Like if every time you got a new phone

616
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
You recycled your own phone

617
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Right that is

618
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
A new phone

619
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,120
Like that is how much of that rare earth metal and mineral

620
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
Kind of stuff that we need it only takes a few grams of

621
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
This metal called Neo Diner

622
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Daimyo

623
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,200
Oh I know that one realtor in order to have all you need for the phone

624
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,016
It's a very very very small amount even when you

625
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Consider the number of phones

626
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,880
It's really not that much whenever people

627
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
It's absolutely true

628
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
Be alright

629
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Come on now

630
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Stop it

631
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
So beyond

632
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
In in the wake

633
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Of the 2010

634
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
Standoff

635
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,128
If you want even call it that with Japan companies like Molly Coors

636
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
Division magnet

637
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
Started looking into

638
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:59,648
Play Lightning McQueen

639
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:06,304
They started to find ways to make the same product without using Rare Earth minerals and there was a bunch

640
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
To go down even without

641
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
I'll buy this really

642
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
A lot of times if you limit

643
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
Resources necessary to make some

644
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
The necessity of making it

645
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
Requires an innovation

646
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
Yeah and that will

647
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
On average

648
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
Work out eventually

649
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
And then also just

650
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
A bunch of other people

651
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Countries like

652
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
South Africa

653
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Malaysia

654
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
They've started

655
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Doing very

656
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Environmentally unfriendly

657
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:43,424
Mining in order unfriendly if Kazakhstan makes the list

658
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,264
Stan is in that list

659
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,384
It's not going to be good for the environment so I did point in 2017 the power of and the

660
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Percentage

661
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Just not 97

662
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Anymore

663
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,600
And not giving any context into why did it get to that point I what has happened

664
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,184
2010 mentality

665
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,584
But the Chinese are going to just say f*** it you guys don't get any rares battles anymore there's nothing we can do

666
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Lose

667
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
The Embargo

668
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Rat is

669
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Completely empty

670
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
It's nonsense

671
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
So there's that

672
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Alex is dumb

673
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
Anyway let's talk more about how trying to suck

674
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Explorer

675
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
In a US company

676
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,928
The federal government sues them

677
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,816
Nachos

678
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,680
You think they're just setting up internal regulations

679
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
Thousands of precision

680
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
Economic front

681
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
While using

682
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
K

683
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
The only

684
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,120
2000 in Congress

685
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
Our last smelting plant closed

686
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
Bullets

687
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
Thank God so we'll never get him now

688
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,968
China doesn't really own the Panama Canal but they bought some

689
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Ports around

690
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
On the sides

691
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Aren't we well

692
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,976
I'm not sure if we do on the Panama Canal Panama Canal but I know we're not

693
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Supposed to

694
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Not anymore

695
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
There was no supposed to give up

696
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,192
Yeah we're supposed to give up control of it I meant

697
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,544
I feel like I remember reading news

698
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Yeah we were

699
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
America

700
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
Here's an article from

701
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
Place called the Trump

702
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
About this

703
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,184
For more than 100 years, canals control the bulk Goods transferred from the Pacific to Italy

704
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,792
For most of that history this Monumental feat of engineering was under the control of the United

705
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
But this is no longer the case

706
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
In May Panama's largest port

707
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
Buy a Chinese cup

708
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
He called lambridge

709
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
Margarita Island port on

710
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Canal's Atlantics

711
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Side offers a company

712
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
Intimate access to one of the most

713
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Important goods

714
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
Distribution centers in the world

715
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
While promising to upgrade

716
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
The ailing Panama facilities

717
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
It offered more trade with America's

718
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
East Coast

719
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
There is substantial reason to hesitate

720
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Critical

721
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
And it isn't just in the dangers of the

722
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
I'm shutting it down

723
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
That's

724
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
Absurd nobody would

725
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Nobody would do

726
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,448
It would be first of all economic

727
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
There's literally no reason to do that

728
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
This company assigned a

729
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
100 million-dollar deals

730
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
The control Panama's Marg

731
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
They bought it

732
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
Too little for something

733
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
You know could be worse

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
In the billions

735
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Definition

736
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
Whoever sold it

737
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
And I don't really care

738
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Now

739
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Do the issue with the end there

740
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Alex is telling us

741
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
That we can't even create bullets

742
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Azrael

743
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
That's really sad

744
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
Where will we get our bullets

745
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
I pulled up

746
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
For company

747
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
Very easy

748
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Google search

749
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
That's Del America

750
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Handmade bullet

751
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,160

Here is my hair is my defense

To Alice

796
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
On this one

797
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
If his

798
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
If his argument is that

799
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
It is a lead smelting issue

800
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,856
Simply because the bullets are made in America does not know

801
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Sarah Lemay

802
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Raw material

803

From America

804
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,072
Are you glad I brought that up

805
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
Alright 2014

806
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
This is absolutely

807
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
A chimney

808
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
What do you say chain email

809
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
I say

810
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
Grandma

811
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:55,296
Yep there's at the American public by the Obama crowd

812
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
Last Blood smelting plant gone

813
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,928
The email goes on to Protection Agency

814
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,280
Mental Protection Agency

815
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
Clever for shutting down the

816
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,960
Smelting plant calling it a backdoor gun control result in the cost of bullets or in

817
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,544
This is in reference to a place called The Doe Run

818
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Let's melting

819
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,896
Implant Missouri

820
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
And that's another rare

821
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Percolate Herculaneum

822
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
Missourians don't pronounce it that way.

823
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,696
I can't even imagine how they twang that s*** up

824
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Then a good territory

825
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
Missouri

826
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
This was the last

827
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
But smelting

828
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Implant

829
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
In the United

830
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
Okay and it did close

831
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
During the Obama

832
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Ministration but it is

833
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
That the EPA actually had any

834
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Because EPA made a bunch of

835
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Complaints

836
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
And they find them a bit

837
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,391
They fixed up the stuff they needed to fix up right and then a couple years later they

838
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,231
There's no indication necessarily that

839
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
You know that they needed to

840
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Shut down because of you

841
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
EPA

842
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
I could just be like this is

843
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Viable

844
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Anymore

845
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
The issue is

846
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
80% of all lead produced in the United

847
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
For vehicle battery

848
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Stationary bike

849
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Now

850
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
The Doe Run smelter

851
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,695
Google Map

852
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
So

853
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
Did Alex doesn't deal with the reality of the

854
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Is Doerun smelting

855
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
They closed down there

856
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Mary

857
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
What can what

858
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Or

859
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
And turns it into metal

860
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
Right

861
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Barry

862
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Polluting

863
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
It is very

864
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Softly

865
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Taking or intern

866
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Sentimental

867
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
What is much cheaper

868
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
And not as pollutant

869
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Is a secondary smell

870
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Takes batteries

871
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
Recycle them

872
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
Are you saying that recycling is cheaper and effective a company is still running using their secondary smelter

873
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
And a lot of them I still do exist

874
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,639
A bunch of this is

875
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
You know

876
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,271
In the US the recycle rate of these batteries is a proxy

877
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Making ledbass batteries them

878
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
Highly recycled consumer product

879
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Presiding estate

880
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,975
These batteries are recycled at secondary LED smelters

881
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
We own such a smelter in southern Missouri

882
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
In our previous fact-checked

883
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Is it from PolitiFact

884
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
Doerun spokesman Tammy Sankey

885
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,471
Like that

886
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,615
Tammy's aunt told us that the company Supply rmo customers using secondary light

887
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Which is great

888
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
So Alex is narratives are completely bust

889
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
You know but it's effective

890
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
You're only make the goodballet out of

891
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,951
The primary let you know don't cut it with battery bulshit

892
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
You got to get it straight from the ground

893
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
They check back in with Spanky

894
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Again

895
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Because

896
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
This this is in reference to Fat Albert's friends right

897
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:35,967
Is our primary sponsor did close but we are still supplying ammo customers through our secondaries

898
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:41,343
We do know the primary light is still being imported to the United States but we don't know if it's

899
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
Specific to ammunition suppliers

900
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
There are many other uses of lead

901
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
The idea that China own

902
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Are you somehow going to

903
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
Threaten us through the Panama Canal was not

904
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,471
Monopoly on Rare Earth minerals

905
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
And somehow that's a threat is none

906
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,335
The idea that we don't make bullets in America

907
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
Is f****** stupid and based off a chain email

908
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
He's so dumb

909
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
Is amazing

910
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,783
He's almost as

911
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
This is where I

912
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
So excited

913
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
When things like this happen I like

914
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Call Ron

915
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,095
This is why we do the show

916
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
Alright so here's the next Clipper Alex says something today thanks to our

917
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,055
Investigation of 2015

918
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
Come out

919
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,503
And responded to Glenn back who's constantly attacking him

920
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
You did

921
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,487
Spent the better part of six months

922
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
So here's the next one where Alex gets really hypocritical about his feelings about Trump

923
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,935
As of the beginning of 2016

924
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Something fundamental

925
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Because it's not just like

926
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
I've decided I like him

927
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
Retconning all of the Patrat

928
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,711
But District

929
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:20,159
Do you want to be the guy that's to turn around

930
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,975
Airplane shooting mer

931
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,935
They're going to pull out the stops

932
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
So

933
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
That's what anybody just for fun let's go back to

934
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
July 3rd 2015

935
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
Palisades houses 4013

936
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,695
Lisa is this Donald Trump

937
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
I'm just a front man

938
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
For some

939
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
And

940
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
They go in there

941
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
This is mind-blowing I don't know what to say

942
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,271
So let's get to this other clip from July 12th 2015

943
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
Is your issue

944
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,647
But Donald Trump owns a bunch of casinos

945
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,975
Frontman

946
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
More Democrats or Republicans

947
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
You can bet I haven't

948
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
Interested I would hate for the globalist to call him a copy of dawn

949
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:07,679
Do not call him

950
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Aiden

951
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
Don Trump they would never hold back

952
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,759
Why did you leave these shows up

953
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
What mystery I want to get to the bottom of Pi restlessness a lot

954
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,743
You know what if it's same thing

955
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,327
Nothing he says means anything at all

956
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
One wouldn't count on an enemy like me

957
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Who would

958
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,959
Listen back

959
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:47,359
So that's one thing he doesn't he doesn't superhero to counteract his supervillain

960
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,175
Like the movie Unbreakable Dan your Bruce Willis

961
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,991
I'm okay with that but you'd be played by

962
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Be careful

963
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:04,767
So the thing of the other thing I think you are you really

964
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
Jordans

965
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
So

966
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
He's banking on his the same thing he does when

967
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
How do you say is like go read this book go Google it

968
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
To see what I said

969
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
So crazy

970
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Just to become

971
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Completely

972
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Literally contradicting yourself Within

973
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
In the span of six

974
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,487
Like yeah what is he

975
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
Bus route

976
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Contradicted your route

977
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
The globalists are going

978
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,215
Talking mafia guy six months earlier

979
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
I have from high-level sources

980
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Or

981
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Is Alex

982
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
The secret global

983
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Today you never know

984
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Controlled opposition Dan

985
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,575
So Alex Jones

986
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
It's down to be

987
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Man talking about some War

988
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
About Mulan

989
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
Yeah let's do that

990
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
People are really getting

991
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,143
Culture you just say no it's over

992
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:19,007
Unless I get a full prison bread in Russia

993
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
Real quick before he gets

994
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
He doesn't actually

995
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Developing

996
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
His feelings on it

997
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
What is an article about

998
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Guy who got poisoned with polonium

999
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
The guy who was clearly a hit

1000
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Bible apps

1001
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,183
There's no Nicholas come out that never do anything like that

1002
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,023
There's a dozen articles come out from UK intelligence

1003
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
Services

1004
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Investigation

1005
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,143
There's a really good chance

1006
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Will signed off on me

1007
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,543
There's a 100% chance

1008
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,127
With 100% certainty

1009
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
Of course

1010
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
Abdou standards of practice

1011
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:06,111
Not even not even like it doesn't need for him to have signed off on it somebody told him that news like f*** you

1012
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
That's the article that he's talking about

1013
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
New responses

1014
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:23,519
I don't see any evidence that it is every country's

1015
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:29,407
To kill off their own secret agent that's not how that works then like I don't know

1016
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,111
There's a 50% chance Russia that they

1017
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
There's no at there's no analysis there's

1018
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Nothing at all

1019
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,583
It's just

1020
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
People

1021
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
Getting it now

1022
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Like

1023
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,703
We hear him say like

1024
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
People are people are really starting to get it

1025
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Right

1026
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,783
Portway

1027
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
David

1028
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,879
But for now let's see how the rest of this clip plays out where he's at

1029
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
Idea of the story about

1030
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
Conflict towards War

1031
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
Roar

1032
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,567
I don't

1033
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Really

1034
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:36,991
Bring you the best products

1035
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:44,415
Because he brags about himself a lot so that one could have been

1036
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
Cuz I feel like people are really getting it now whenever and activities going to happen

1037
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
Sing because he like that ad.

1038
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
Do you like

1039
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,959
I bought my gray matter in my butt

1040
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Like

1041
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,079
Couldn't have been a like I do it to get all the truth to you

1042
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:08,479
It's it's a nefarious pivot anyways pretty strong

1043
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,039
After all I'm still like

1044
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
There's no way this is

1045
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,903
This disgraceful

1046
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,487
At this point in January

1047
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
The point

1048
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,071
Blood in the Water Crisis

1049
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
Was at a point

1050
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
That even Alex could not

1051
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
Ignore yeah everybody was

1052
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,007
Thank God everybody's finally paid attention to it

1053
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
And really gotten

1054
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
The bottom of it

1055
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
Antenna Flashpoint

1056
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
Alex couldn't

1057
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
Decided to talk about

1058
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
I left out a lot of

1059
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
This because it's not

1060
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,039
Right but I will give you the

1061
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
Three bullet points

1062
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
First f*** Michael Moore

1063
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
This is the city's problem

1064
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
No

1065
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
Why we talk about this

1066
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
Everyone got fluoride

1067
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Interesting narrative

1068
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
Interesting narrative

1069
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
That's really comprehensive

1070
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
Like he gets to old

1071
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,711
To get to use all of the buffalo buffalo

1072
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,783
People who are dying

1073
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
I have left

1074
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,135
This clipping because I think it's probably the most important

1075
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
The most demonstrative of Alex Jones

1076
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,815
And I should say this is while he's on the phone with Lee Ann McAdoo

1077
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,607
She went and did some field

1078
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,423
She is in Flint but he

1079
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
You keep saying that

1080
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Cold for her

1081
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Is not how that work

1082
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:42,687
Is Leanne talk to some people

1083
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
Really a big issue was like I do not want you to say that on there

1084
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:53,951
At one point and the it just deteriorates into a plug

1085
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,351
Cuz she's like you know I'm glad I got my total cleanse out here to got it

Drink water out here

00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,823
A little while to get her hair to fall out

1088
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
I don't know what

1089
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
Does that mean that when she takes it

1090
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
22 Hornet

1091
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,295
The world

1092
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319

Well now I kind of want to

00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791

So here's Alex's Alex's interrupting

1101
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
At this point

00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
And given what

1103
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
Point really is

1104
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
Honorable Jen

1105
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
Onomatopoeia

1106
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Very important

1107
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:09,215
Black America

1108
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
Henry Ford

1109
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,615
Then the mafia movie organized crime Union

1110
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:21,759
And they took it over and that's just as far as I'm concerned and I talked to michiganders are great people

1111
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,343
Detroit and plant aren't part of the ship

1112
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,207
Wonderful no

1113
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,279
Sagging pants feeding off their people

1114
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,631
And this is what

1115
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
Hope you die Alex

Interesting

1121
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
In fact that you can find about

1122
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,111
These two communities but he's deemed not apart

1123
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
Of Michigan

00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,727
Barry White is 41.2% black

1129
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Let me ask you a question

1130
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
Where would that 14-point

1131
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
2% pecans

1132
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
Detroit

1133
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,687
It is 12.3% white

1134
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
81 points

1135
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:30,623
Percent black how they do I don't either also in

1136
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
In Flint

1137
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
The racial makeup of the city according

1138
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
Consensus was 53 point

1139
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
3%

1140
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,095
African American

1141
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
41.1%

1142
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
That white

1143
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
So even that

1144
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
Damn chili

1145
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
Outside of the norm

1146
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
A Michigan

1147
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,311
Yorktown's like

1148
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
Ann Arbor

1149
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,503
Is there a heavier white concentration

1150
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
I'll be goddamned

1151
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
If it didn't have anything

1152
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
Things to do with the white flight era

1153
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:06,719
And everybody who lived in the city being afraid of black people so they moved out to

1154
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,767
To the goddamn suburbs and rural

1155
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
F****** live

1156
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,095
If you want to look at it

1157
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
Even closer analysis

1158
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
You'll find that the average median

1159
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,495
Per capita income

1160
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,823
Detroit is a good $8,000

1161
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
The year less

1162
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
The entirety of Michigan

1163
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663
Well that's because the uni

1164
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
Sanders because

1165
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Thug

1166
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:34,623
Crime bosses of all been busted up lunch

1167
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Pinpoint

1168
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,439
115

1169
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
Point stick

1170
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
Percent higher incidence

1171
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
People living

1172
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
Below the poverty line

1173
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
In Detroit then there is

1174
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
Entirety

1175
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,447
I'm not entirely sure how I'm sorry

1176
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
26 point

1177
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
4% of the population

1178
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,615
Implant is under the poverty line including

1179
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
37.4 of those

1180
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Under the age of eight

1181
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
So

1182
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
Two things that were taught

1183
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,039
When when Alex wants

1184
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
To save the Detroit

1185
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,135
Aren't part of Michigan

1186
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
That's cold

1187
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
That's not anything other than

1188
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,047
Boy these places are anomalous and how black they are

1189
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
Right

1190
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Pretend like

1191
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
When the Germans in the polls

1192
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,751
And Zachary for date.

1193
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,175
It was mainly the German

1194
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,223
All the Germans are the poles left

1195
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
And now I hate

1196
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
Definitely wasn't

1197
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,927
A f****** Nazi he wasn't involved in

1198
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Protocol

1199
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
Berkel protocols

1200
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
So

1201
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
That's disgraceful

1202
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
So I find it

1203
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Very

1204
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
Disgusting

1205
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
Considering what we now know

1206
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Year later

1207
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
About that

1208
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Fertility problems that have come from the lab

1209
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Poison ivy

1210
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,127
It's such a 1 x 1 of Alex Jones

1211
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
The big narratives is

1212
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
You don't really care about blacks

1213
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
Fertility that Ma

1214
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
That's probably why

1215
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Big deal

1216
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,367
Scoring points on a

1217
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,159
Like I don't have a clip

1218
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Swear to you he doesn't

1219
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
He's talking about any like

1220
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Water filter

1221
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,423
F*** you utilize in people

1222
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Suffering in order to

1223
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:28,799
Sell your products to sell snake oil products

1224
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,359
All his products I think the water filtration

1225
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
Probably the best

1226
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
Like there is a place for

1227
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
For water filtration in the world

1228
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
It's maybe not the biggest emergence

1229
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
For most people

1230
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,903
Compared to the real red pill

1231
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,951
I would take a water filter

1232
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
In my day

1233
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,559
Yeah but it didn't have Alex Jones's f******

1234
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Space Oddity

1235
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
If you do so

1236
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,727
You could get angry at water everywhere

1237
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,847
Throat across the room

1238
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
I just

1239
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Believe

1240
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,735
It's so obvious and its soldiers

1241
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Disheartening

1242
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,295
That we all know

1243
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
How big of an issue Flint

1244
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
No no

1245
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,695
That's an issue that we could for real thick

1246
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,767
Like of all the things that we could fix

1247
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047
That's one

1248
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,327
Wood

1249
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,607
It would cost money

1250
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
It would be hard but

1251
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,471
Think about how we could f****** fix it and it's not

1252
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
And think about what's lost by Nas

1253
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,991
Like that was a direct result of those f****** assholes being like well we need to keep

1254
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,039
Detroit from going break bankrupt

1255
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
We need to divert our Waters

1256
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Reply to this

1257
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,903
Different place we need a f*** over everybody

1258
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,439
And then we're going to lie about it

1259
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
For four years

1260
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,279
Could f****** fix it and we

1261
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
We just want

1262
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,167
I think I'd write my own and

1263
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
Still trying to recover

1264
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
And we know that this is an issue

1265
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,871
But it's just one of so many f****** issues it's so hard to care about everything

1266
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
Has issues

1267
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
Or at least what

1268
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,039
This triggers in a lot of people who could help

1269
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
Is a Samsung

1270
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
Ego

1271
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Or Samsung

1272
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Pride

1273
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
But I think there's a

1274
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
Piece of eclair

1275
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
You know it's

1276
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
People be like that's not play the blame game

1277
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
You don't need to do that

1278
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
Right

1279
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:37,055
It's like a prosecutor would be held accountable until they never fixed

1280
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
Problem

1281
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,383
Secutor who put away an innocent man

1282
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,687
And everybody knows they're Innocent but the process

1283
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
Sakura has to constantly be like

1284
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,599
No no we got the right guy we got the right guy I definitely

1285
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:54,207
The death has really quick to because this episode we're recording this on Sunday

1286
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,023
Come out on Monday

1287
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
Getting off the Flint

1288
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,863
Turn back on to church

1289
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,423
I want to get a prediction about an Alex Jones narrative

1290
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,239
The other day

1291
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,799
It came out that one of the judges

1292
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
MB

1293
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Ninth circuit

1294
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
Alex Kozinski

1295
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,943
Has serial sexual harasser

1296
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Other kind of harass

1297
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
Just a piece of s*** all are abusive

1298
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Type of guy

1299
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,183
You know it is an allegation

1300
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,743
Lady who wrote about it

1301
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,047
Seems very believable

1302
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,351
I have no reason to disbelieve

1303
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Fight

1304
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Quartering

1305
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
100% believer

1306
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,055
What I want to make a prediction about

1307
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
Alex is going to

1308
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Use that

1309
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
As

1310
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,663
Ammo against the night circus

1311
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
He hates them so much

1312
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,039
Because they've outlawed American flag shirts

1313
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:55,135
At schools and stuff like that yeah

1314
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
No

1315
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
We know that he will not a chance I bet he doesn't hate the nights you hate

1316
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
You been yelling about this forever anyway

1317
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
Buddylove sexual harassment

1318
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
True but any chance

1319
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
He could have

1320
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
To attack the night circus

1321
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
You going to take

1322
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
And he's intellectually inconsistent

1323
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,895
Believable degree

1324
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,199
That's true I'm just I'm just laying my bed

1325
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,271
There's a 50% chance

1326
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
And that's all I'm sorry I don't I don't I think you're wrong going on red or black hair and I'm going to pick black

1327
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
I hope you're

1328
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,999
No I don't hope you're right cuz either way it's a fuk narrative

1329
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,839
Resume

1330
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
If I'm right

1331
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,703
I looked it up he had nothing to do with that.

1332
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:47,359
He wasn't on the panel of Judges that Alex Jones talked about with the ninth circuit court and was not involved

1333
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Completely irrelevant

1334
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
To any value

1335
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
Narrative so preemptively that

1336
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
I think where I think we are

1337
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
At the point now with

1338
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Public

1339
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,951
Accusations of sexual

1340
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
The people who are coming

1341
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,535
Forward

1342
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,815
And the people who are accused

1343
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
If you're accused

1344
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
You're guilty until proven

1345
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
At this point

1346
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:16,031
I don't comfortable with that but I don't disagree

1347
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,847
Exactly exactly

1348
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
It's almost impossible to

1349
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Proven negative

1350
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,503
Chances of false accusation

1351
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
Right by the number of people coming

1352
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,767
Guess what you f******

1353
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,839
I accidentally stumbled into the men's right

1354
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,887
Subreddit

1355
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
And

1356
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,775
They were talking about some of these issues

1357
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,615
I saw somebody posted something about how the

1358
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Project

1359
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Most of the people who have been released

1360
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,503
Innocent project

1361
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Rape

1362
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:05,439
So they were making the argument that false rape accusations are real and a big deal

1363
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,703
What was black man raping white women that might have been the issue I went to

1364
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
Project website

1365
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263
Went through or perhaps

1366
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Or better said

1367
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Black men

1368
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,615
Not raping right right right

1369
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Touching your

1370
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
What is a bulk of

1371
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,783
The cases

1372
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
Is another issue

1373
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
It's parceled in

1374
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
Slightly but that's not about

1375
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,255
Position about women

1376
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
End racism

1377
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,863
Getting the wrong people and it's really more about the police

1378
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
Anything else

1379
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
So then the other thing was

1380
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
This person

1381
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
On Reddit was making this argue

1382
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
Was bundling in a bunch of

1383
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Rape and

1384
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
The murders

1385
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
You can't really make a

1386
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
The false accusation

1387
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Murdered

1388
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
That's the police doing

1389
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
You want to say like

1390
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,367
It doesn't

1391
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,207
Is that the woman who was not right

1392
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,023
No no no no

1393
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
Because these cases of people who are

1394
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,095
Exonerated 4

1395
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,631
These crimes involve rape

1396
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,679
Really making the argument that

1397
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,727
A bunch of false accusations exam

1398
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Embrace

1399
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
When you take out the ones that have

1400
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
With

1401
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
Racially charged incident

1402
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Murders

1403
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
But it's like zero

1404
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,503
It's very slim I'm not sure I found a

1405
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
That word legitimate

1406
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,367
What is a legitimate I mean

1407
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,903
Fall into his argument

1408
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
It's lightly.

1409
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
The Under Undertaker

1410
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
Purely statistical analysis

1411
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
With how rare it is

1412
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,351
To get a false rape accusation

1413
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
If it's more than one woman

1414
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,751
There's a 97% chance that you were

1415
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
A f****** Siri

1416
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
Or the globalist

1417
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Also possible

1418
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
Open

1419
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,759
The episode here

1420
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
We get a gas

1421
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
I suggest that we know well

1422
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
The guest we spoke to

1423
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
On the phone for an hour

1424
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,559
Mike Caplan

1425
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
No no

1426
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
It is Larry nickel

1427
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
F*** that guy

1428
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:28,031
Comes in a little bit

1429
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,103
The soft rice Nicaraguan Freedom Fighter Nick

1430
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
Larry the big old

1431
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,431
Fraudulent piece of garbage

1432
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,295
Larry Nichols be f****** Vince Foster f*** face that can go kill him

1433
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,367
So Larry Nichols comes on it doesn't even really have cancer

1434
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,135
According to

1435
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,951
Some online speculation we're not.

1436
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,327
So Larry Nichols big arguments that he's coming on to pitch

1437
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
Are there

1438
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,911
Elizabeth Warren

1439
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,447
And Joe Biden are waiting in the wings

1440
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
I know they're about to take over

1441
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Hillary

1442
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,591
But Hillary has blackmail on everybody

1443
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,383
So she's not going to let him do that

1444
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,711
So that's what that's what's going on from his insidesource

1445
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Right

1446
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:14,111
Control over the Democratic national committee's funding sources

1447
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,927
You would be right but Elizabeth Warren

1448
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,975
Was considering running

1449
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,727
Well not really really close to getting a knob because of

1450
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
Absolutely

1451
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:35,103
He was really close to it don't don't mistake

1452
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,199
The Dear Miss we had with Joe Biden

1453
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
Versus

1454
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Narrative

1455
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Important

1456
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
Yeah because that

1457
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
That can exist

1458
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,183
In reality and Larry's narrative with Larry's narrative

1459
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,143
For the first time we believe Larry

1460
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,471
So in the last couple appearance

1461
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
If you had on the show

1462
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
Larry Nichols has waffle

1463
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Back and forth

1464
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
From

1465
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,127
Trump is the only person who can save us

1466
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
To Hillary's the only one who can save us from Barack Obama turning us into a Muslim caliphate when he becomes king

1467
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,087
Makes sense so he has no like he is

1468
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
No

1469
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
At all but on this appearance

1470
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
He's on the Trump

1471
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,023
Annie says something

1472
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
That I think

1473
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Is him

1474
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Showing

1475
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
Too many cards

1476
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,983
And being a little too over but your mic time

1477
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Are the Yu-Gi-Oh cards

1478
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
No.

1479
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
Not Pokemon

1480
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:44,479
This is The Showdown Alex just said that this still election that are countries

1481
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
A G right now

1482
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,087
And that's why we've got to get in

1483
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,903
We the average American

1484
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,023
You know we're being excluded from the whole thing

1485
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:03,935
Where the dinosaur where the ones that are they broken coalition

1486
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,007
Ariel office

1487
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
They now down where the minorities were walled up before they played politics now it's the other way around and people are saying good

1488
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,039
Fuel white guy

1489
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,879
They just don't want middle class people.

1490
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:30,815
That's right I mean Western

1491
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,863
Culture

1492
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,151
In one Fell Swoop Larry has admitted we just need white

1493
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,687
White man to take over

1494
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,479
Skip

1495
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,063
They already have

1496
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,855
Larry

1497
01:11:54,111 --> 01:12:00,255
How much better everything is with white men run things

1498
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Spider-Man to work together

1499
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,607
The other in one Fell Swoop

1500
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Alex has

1501
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
Indicated that these eyes

1502
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,959
He is about Western ism

1503
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
And that stuff

1504
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,311
Warriors

1505
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
That's f***** up man

1506
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
You shouldn't have said that

1507
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
Again

1508
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
This is the era of mixed

1509
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
The subtext text man

1510
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,023
Next year's news today about tomorrow's razors Ray

1511
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
F******

1512
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,863
Unreal

1513
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Wwoof

1514
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
We got to talk to Larry about that

1515
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
On my way.

1516
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
Now we don't

1517
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:47,103
Really apply but I've never really liked on the episode

1518
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
We had to rely

1519
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,391
On white women to really get us through this situation

1520
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
And white women failed

1521
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,303
I'm not ready to come down on

1522
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Necessarily

1523
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,375
Be that as it may

1524
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,447
Like in the times that I've listened to this show and all the all of this

1525
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
This history

1526
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,543
Nichols be really islamophobic

1527
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,359
Really f***** up on that tip

1528
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,175
I've never heard him say something that over

1529
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
That overly white National

1530
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Yeah

1531
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,319
I've never I've never heard that and that took me

1532
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,647
That man wasn't surprised necessarily

1533
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,231
Photo of course I thought it was sort of imply that that was in his

1534
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,767
Beliefs

1535
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,559
Time it did surprise me a little

1536
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
Wake me up

1537
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
Yes

1538
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,703
Okay yeah

1539
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,263
Pretend

1540
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
Non-racist

1541
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,847
Whole Hog be like

1542
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
White dude

1543
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,431
Write up what would he says like

1544
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,223
Average American

1545
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,063
White damage

1546
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,855
Like that is

1547
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
I constantly

1548
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
We struggled with this like

1549
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Feel like

1550
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
Is it the Joker's like I want a higher class of

1551
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,839
Criminal in this town

1552
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,239
I get this app

1553
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
We didn't these guys

1554
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
When there

1555
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:27,711
I think the same way we just ended up with soda

1556
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,503
Disappointed in Allen

1557
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:34,623
Make me work for Jack nationalism out on disc

1558
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:38,719
I meant being like when someone calls you a racist being like where's the proof

1559
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:45,119
Everywhere

1560
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,591
The big store Friday

1561
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,639
I don't know if I should get into

1562
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
What

1563
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
Okay

1564
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,063
So I've been doing a bit of research on this guy name

1565
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Ted Malik

1566
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,391
Pretty regular

1567
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Ted Malik

1568
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,231
Ted Malik malloc

1569
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
Ch

1570
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
Ted moloch

1571
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:19,935
Mi-Wok the god

1572
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,727
Use a part of the

1573
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
Davos group

1574
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
But he's turned on them

1575
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,615
Bright ideas

1576
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,967
Sure is a big proponent of brexit and then was allegedly

1577
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Trump pic

1578
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
To be the ambassador

1579
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
You

1580
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:41,439
But it didn't work out I wonder why a bunch of videos came out of him being like I wanted to

1581
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:45,791
Destroy the EU you were like

1582
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,655
Don't do that as opposed as opposed to Trump's pick for the FEC

1583
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Main goal was

1584
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
I would have destroyed the FCC

1585
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,871
For the f****** CFA the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

1586
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,407
Who is literally said

1587
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,711
I want to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection

1588
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:08,575
Right right

1589
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
So

1590
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
If you look into it

1591
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
This guy Ted Malik

1592
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,999
I'm going to write an article about that and put it on the website

1593
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
This information will be

1594
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
Burien

1595
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:24,703
Hirota autobiography called Aspen Davos and Yale

1596
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
He is probably in a

1597
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
I don't know you looks good

1598
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,639
I put them in late fifties early 6

1599
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,015
People have done some analysis

1600
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
Of his book

1601
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,087
Check a bunch of claims

1602
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
And they are not real

1603
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,487
He claims that he was quoting knighted and The Sovereign order is

1604
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
St John by the Queen Elizabeth

1605
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
The second Purcell

1606
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,607
And to my closest family and friends

1607
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,911
I am therefore known as Sir Ted

1608
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Love that

1609
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
All right now

1610
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,823
Disregard anything that's going to result from this

1611
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
I love a man who will write an autobiography

1612
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,431
Where he is a false

1613
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,967
Sir

1614
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,831
So the foreign board with anybody

1615
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
To just be like

1616
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
The financial times looked into it turns out he received the medal of st. John

1617
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
In 2000

1618
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
M5

1619
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:26,399
But it was as a quote serving brother

1620
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,471
A British honors several ranks lower than Knighthood

1621
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
It does not carry

1622
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
Title and members do

1623
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,823
Do not attended investiture with the queen

1624
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:38,687
The screen wasn't even involved when they reached out to Malik 44

1625
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
It's not a Knighthood

1626
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,599
I never suggested it was in the book he says I was texting

1627
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,159
So also he claims

1628
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,207
He also claimed that he was made a layered

1629
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,255
By Lourdes Leon

1630
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,583
And given a personal coat of arms of the fancy Latin inscription

1631
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,399
Okay however and the Latin inscription mean

1632
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
F****** liar

1633
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Tattoo

1634
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
Violin

1635
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,567
Octoboy

1636
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,615
Alright so Coronavirus

1637
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
From the financial times

1638
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
However a cork

1639
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,271
Keeper of records at the court of Lourdes Leon said quote

1640
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,623
The Lord Lyon does not nor could he create a personal Laird

1641
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,671
It would certainly be incorrect

1642
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:26,303
Mr. Malik to say he was made a layered by the Lord Lyon king of arms

1643
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119
Mr. Malik

1644
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359
God I love

1645
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,199
I love the delusional guys who go back far enough for it to be

1646
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Yeah just like the idea

1647
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,063
Yeah I got a barrel

1648
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:52,415
Made For Me by Queen Elizabeth The First like what are you f****** doing

1649
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,023
I promise that this is going to get back to

1650
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
Stormfront

1651
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,071
As we jumped off

1652
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:06,239
Don't want to live in scroll world I don't want nothing to do with Stormfront so there's

1653
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:11,103
There's a bunch of other things

1654
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,151
You made a bunch of other assertion

1655
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,343
Ricky Lafayette Verity book

1656
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,135
You claim that he was a professor at ox

1657
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
The University of

1658
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:31,327
Yeah the University of Oxford rejected Mr Malik

1659
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,655
The solution to a benefit your fellow at the Wilson College

1660
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,263
Publicity statement about and by Professor Ted moloch

1661
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,847
He is described as having been a senior fellow at Wilson College

1662
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,431
This is inaccurate

1663
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:52,319
Mr. Malik was a visiting academic for 2 years but he barely rarely visited the college

1664
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:56,415
I did not see through any of his plans for research activities with the college

1665
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,975
Add at the University which is usually real lucky

1666
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,767
Criticize former staff

1667
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,375
See this is this is my biggest issue hold on hold on hold on

1668
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
In the in his CV also states that fellow and director of an international summer school at 10

1669
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:18,688
Bro college at Oxford College told the financial times

1670
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
God

1671
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,528
This is the thing that drives me insane

1672
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
Right

1673
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,368
Here's what I want from liberals

1674
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,696
Here's what I want from all the people who say when they go low

1675
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,232
We go high

1676
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,048
If you are given a quote like that

1677
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
If somebody

1678
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
Comes to you

1679
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,144
Oxford fuckfaces

1680
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,424
And says

1681
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,520
Senior fellow there you should have the right

1682
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,104
And the prerogative to be like that dude's a f****** liar

1683
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,920
What b******* that's the case

1684
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
Don't say

1685
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
That's incorrect

1686
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,808
Be very direct and save it f***** is lying

1687
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,208
Spokesman for so many people would be like

1688
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:08,608
Here is what I do and then I would be over for you.

1689
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
Is book mr. Malik Wright City

1690
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:17,056
Completed his entire doctoral program and a

1691
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,616
Unprecedented Less Than 3 years

1692
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,408
Between 1976 and 90

1693
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
79

1694
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:28,064
However the University of Toronto says

1695
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,440
After being questioned by the financial times mr. Malik said that he had completed his coursework at Oral exam

1696
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Within three years

1697
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,560
Buddy's Pizza took longer

1698
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,936
Mr. Malik recently claimed

1699
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,240
Soviet Union

1700
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:51,872
After I. His most senior diplomatic executive

1701
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,736
Executive secretary in the UN economic commission for Europe

1702
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,296
Between 19 and 1991

1703
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,088
Who else was better place

1704
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,368
To take down the Soviet Union

1705
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,184
Nick said his role was ambassador-level

1706
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,232
Un and US officials at the post

1707
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,792
Not regarded as an equivalent

1708
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:16,960
He's just a liar he's just a complete

1709
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
Lead his

1710
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
Also

1711
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,360
He also took out a like a number of loan

1712
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Over the years

1713
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
For millions of dollars from Banks

1714
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,968
Advantage defaulted on them

1715
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,528
Also claimed

1716
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,808
Much higher FF

1717
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Took the law

1718
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
So the bank would give them to him

1719
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,672
He said that he was worth like

1720
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
30 million dollars

1721
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
Money took out these loans

1722
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,328
Maybe 10 years ago or so I'm sorry

1723
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,864
I don't quite have the date

1724
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,680
But what

1725
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,240
When it came time to pay back along today

1726
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
I should have only got 150

1727
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,408
$52,000 default on the loan

1728
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
You still own this money

1729
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:05,088
The problem with that is

1730
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:10,208
Kind of want to be on his side anytime somebody lies to a bank

1731
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
And then is just like

1732
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,048
I got away with it

1733
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,888
Confidently they get millions of dollars

1734
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,264
I have one more thing to read

1735
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,312
We'll get into where we get

1736
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
Towards the

1737
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,920
Okay so also claims

1738
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
He's a descendant

1739
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,480
Theodore Roosevelt

1740
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,760
Perfect

1741
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Go Wilder

1742
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,856
He's a descendant of Cleopatra

1743
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
Stop at Teddy Roosevelt has been helped by an unusual claim

1744
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:48,608
Reading from the financial times here President Theodore

1745
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:52,704
Theodore Roosevelt after my paternal wasp

1746
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,776
Who remains one of the finest exemplars of the breed

1747
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,104
Mr. Malik wrote in his autobiography Aspen

1748
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
The connection has been repeated by right-wing publication

1749
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Breitbart

1750
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:03,968
Which refrigerant is

1751
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
The great grandson

1752
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:10,112
The President Theodore Roosevelt The Daily Caller said that Mr Malik's

1753
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,648
Ancestor and vedanta

1754
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,976
Sounds true however birth records analyzed by a front-end

1755
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,280
Time on the genealogical link

1756
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
Mr. Malik said his relationship

1757
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
Theodore Roosevelt

1758
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,192
Who was born in Philadelphia in 1921

1759
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:30,848
An obituary of mr. Malik senior does not mention any link to President Roosevelt

1760
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,944
Years before he was born in your parents were Henry Wilson

1761
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,968
Symbolic a plumber

1762
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,760
From Scotland and Frieda Schneider

1763
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Housewife born in German

1764
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:43,648
Financial Times could find no link between them and President Roosevelt who was age

1765
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,696
About 35 when they were born

1766
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:50,816
President Roosevelt's great-great-grandson Kermit Roosevelt said he had never heard of Ted Baloch

1767
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,120
Mr. Malik told the financial times

1768
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,448
I was always told that my grandmother was a descendant of a Roosevelt relative

1769
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,776
German birth records are available only to direct

1770
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
Initially offered to send

1771
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,224
The financial times

1772
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,808
He goes out to damage his reputation

1773
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Can I not to establish back

1774
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,136
I feel like he was out to damage

1775
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
One of mr. Malik

1776
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,512
Gold was named Woodrow Wilson Malik

1777
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,192
Mr. valek declined to comment on whether the family was released

1778
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,080
Woodrow it look

1779
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,384
If you're with a ranking system

1780
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
I want to go Teddy Roosevelt

1781
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:44,576
I'm not going to go with the president who made black people hide whenever he was walking through the f****** White House

1782
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,160
Yeah it was like looking through this and I'm like

1783
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,440
Amazing

1784
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
He is such a liar

1785
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,560
A lot of these lies are things

1786
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
In his book

1787
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
I would like that

1788
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,400
Really dangerous

1789
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,424
For a publisher

1790
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,984
Like to put out these false statement

1791
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,824
Cuz if you lying about all this stuff who knows what other stuff he's lying about

1792
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:11,712
His claims are really up for grabs like to the point where I looked into it I can't find any

1793
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
Evidence

1794
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,504
He was involved

1795
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,552
Strictly speaking with the Aspen Inn

1796
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
He was in a video

1797
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
In 1991

1798
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
Okay

1799
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,488
The world economic forum

1800
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,024
Where he's introducing

1801
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
People really like

1802
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,656
Everything

1803
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,704
About him to be up for grabs

1804
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,496
Hey you know what maybe we should

1805
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,776
Start doing then

1806
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:41,408
Is let's go through a lot of autobiographies that we rely on as historical.

1807
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
Maybe

1808
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,528
This dude's a f****** bullshiter who knew how to write when most people did

1809
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,344
Right so I looked into it and it turns out

1810
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
The Davos Aspen and Yale

1811
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208

1812
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
Day

1813
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,816
Davos Aspen and yeah

1814
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
You know you know who put it out

1815
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,168

1816
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
There's a publishers

1817
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:13,152
Of course not on any other actual publisher

1818
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:18,016
If you don't know WorldNetDaily it's another crazy

1819
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:24,416

So this is a fun derivation

1823
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,840
I'm glad that we were able to go down

1824
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,376
I looked into it

1825
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,912

01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:54,176
How to turn

1868
01:29:54,432 --> 01:30:00,576
The tide it's going up here but I don't know what you want what do you want from there

1869
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,392
Play Michael Brown dr. Michael Brown

1870
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:08,256
Most notable because of being a closet

1871
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,072
Yeah and a couple months ago he

1872
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
Gotten hot water

1873
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
The internet turned on in a little

1874
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:18,240
Hiring a Rentboy

1875
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:24,640
About this

1876
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:31,040
Post that you wrote called when social media explodes over an editing oversight

1877
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,344
The ending oversight being reissued

1878
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:39,744
So when I wrote my article asking whether it was time for another Jesus movement among Jewish Millennials I fully expected to

1879
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
Some pushback

1880
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:44,608
Since the subject of Jews believe in Jesus is hardly without controversy and emotion

1881
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,168
Jews for Jesus I'm fully aware of how hot

1882
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
This topic has

1883
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,520
Surprised and embarrassed made it turns out that a lot of the controversy

1884
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,568
We had nothing to do with the substance of the article

1885
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,872
Focus on a website I hyperlink

1886
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Two of the article

1887
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,760
Explain briefly My article was responding to a recent poll

1888
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Percent of Jewish millennials

1889
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:09,440
Believe Jesus was either God incarnate or a rabbi or spiritual leader

1890
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
Me time to see a great

1891
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,768
Spiritual Revival among these Jewish millennial

1892
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,120
Just as we saw in the Jesus people movement of the late 60s and early 70s

1893
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,960
So that pole that you talked about that article

1894
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
Sure

1895
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
The hyperlink

1896
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:28,384
To 100% it was from Stormfront

1897
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,248
Sounds good so everybody's like a guy

1898
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
Maybe

1899
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,320
Maybe just maybe

1900
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,720
Anything about Jews from Stormfront ever made me laugh so hard

1901
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,816
One of my first of all this outlasting the gay Revolution that's a book

1902
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,840
That's amazing

1903
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:51,424
I meant to find out by reading that book until

1904
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,984
I had to Google

1905
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
Lick the Stormfront

1906
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,360
And his argument is like

1907
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,760
I didn't know they were neo-nazis

1908
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
At the same time

1909
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:10,624
How sloppy of a job are you doing if you link to something that's

1910
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,904
Supposedly in defense

1911
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,672
Your point

1912
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,976
And you don't know what the character of the website

1913
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:18,816
You know a little editorial work

1914
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,584
We do

1915
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,424
It's so frustrating to me because

1916
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
I have

1917
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,240
I have started

1918
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
Finish like

1919
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,312
Forty or fifty thousand words

1920
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,848
And never wound up eggs

1921
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:31,872
Finishing a buck

1922
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,504
And this week

1923
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,064
Ifucking finished the book

1924
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,392
What is so frustrating to finish it out the book

1925
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:49,024
I can't just force yourself to finish

1926
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,584
Yeah product would be what you wanted

1927
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
Well then you burn it

1928
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Right

1929
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,400
Turn up

1930
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,216
Look up a contract is a

1931
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:03,616
Sweet f****** fraud and that's the bottom line of that also look for my follow-up book

1932
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,968
Homosexual Revolution

1933
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:12,064
Put this out there

1934
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,112
Sexual Revolution

1935
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,904
She's just about to Everlast

1936
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
You know what it's like

1937
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,584
So the other thing is like

1938
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:29,216
Probably wasn't involved with globalist or anything like that

1939
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
He's absolutely a combat

1940
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,592
Or he's just a mentally ill person who has delusions

1941
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:38,432
There's a great clip that you can find of him

1942
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,736
At a symposium

1943
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
Right after the

1944
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
In London

1945
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,320
Yeah I believe it's 11 somewhere

1946
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:51,232
Discussion about how like now we have to deal with the fact that a president would lie on

1947
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Twitter

1948
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,024
And

1949
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Ted mollica's like

1950
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,704
What we might we had a President Who Lies everyday on Twitter for eight years trying to be a dishy

1951
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,664
Why the light everyday for what's an example

1952
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:14,272
Well he came over here and said that we should

1953
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Because I'm cool.

1954
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
That's not a lie

1955
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:21,184
That might be unwise if that's your opinion but

1956
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,232
What's a statement of an opinion

1957
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:38,080
We don't have time

1958
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,360
Is somehow Allah

1959
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,384
Well that's true

1960
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,920
But it's it's not

1961
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
This guy

1962
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Anyway

1963
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,272
That's Victor caliber.

1964
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,088
That was a weird derivation for us to go off on

1965
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,696
Let's get back into it with the next

1966
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
January twenty

1967
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,560
Alex starts January 22nd by being like

1968
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Now

1969
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,888
For a long time I've been critical about

1970
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,008
Do you mean the 10th planet

1971
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:07,776
Okay

1972
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
I mean

1973
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,848
Israel

1974
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:14,176
Planets

1975
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,992
And we know that because of irregularities in the

1976
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,272
The orbits of other play

1977
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Well I mean

1978
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:24,416
That's probably going to Larry 12th Planet

1979
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:30,816
Are we dealing with Pluto like it's the 13th floor on a hotel

1980
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Stanley Alex

1981
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
Because now it's Ian just

1982
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
Have come out

1983
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,216
Started to discuss the idea that there is another planet out there that we just

1984
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,264
A grasp on coz

1985
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,824
Too far away to write the orbit is not such

1986
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,408
That we can study it well it's there because of the effect on other planets

1987
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,456
Eva is

1988
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
Narrative is

1989
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:54,112
You can't really see a black hole but the gravity energy of a black hole

1990
01:35:54,368 --> 01:36:00,512
Totally did Pluto from being Planet so this could be the ninth planet so

1991
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
Conspiracy theorist

1992
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,816
Talk about Planet X

1993
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
The tenth planet

1994
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:12,544
Wow

1995
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,408
Just need to work on something else but it is an interesting example of Alex Soto

1996
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,200
Mia culpa

1997
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:23,552
Being like I've been critical of looks like it there

1998
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,576
I like

1999
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
Alex

2000
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,648
The Planet X stuff is like ancient alien

2001
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,512
Stop yeah it's about like Angela Lynn enki and the the

2002
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
Dip dip

2003
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
Don't give them a tip of the cap

2004
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,704
Just because scientists have found

2005
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,240
The effects of a wobble

2006
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,776
No it's it's not

2007
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:47,616
But he gets into a bunch of other crazy s***

2008
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:50,176
Like I we were here in this first Clifton

2009
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,200
Favorite planet

2010
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,504
You did learn over the last 11 months

2011
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,136
Planet 9 from Outer Space all right

2012
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
Plan 9

2013
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,280
Dammit

2014
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
This except Alex Jones

2015
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,352
You're going to school

2016
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,080
They confuse them so much

2017
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
But officially in every school in the country

2018
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
Super planet

2019
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:41,888
Travel

2020
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,472
Have weirdo

2021
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
Tellonym

2022
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:53,152
PNC is bad and you don't have to be a boy or girl for you can be gay or you can be then

2023
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:59,808
What a group of cult creeps that we let come in and chat us over

2024
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:03,904
Group sign-on

2025
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,000
Misunderstanding

2026
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
Attitude verses

2027
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,048
Tavistock Clinic

2028
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,608
Like that sort of stuff about there going to be

2029
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,144
Be coming into the schools and

2030
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
Manipulating your children into things

2031
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
Another gay or

2032
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,824
General hatred of

2033
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
Higher Learning

2034
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
Right

2035
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,408
It's hard

2036
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:31,040
Very and also a misunderstanding of how tribal memories relate to space

2037
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,344
Or or formal

2038
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,392
Not a big fan of formula

2039
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Can you

2040
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,768
Can you conceive of a world where I am

2041
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,560
Tribal memories

2042
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
Is a

2043
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,632
School class that you take yes

2044
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:52,032
I could do we live in that world and Native Americans wouldn't be in Hawaii

2045
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
Like for a couple years

2046
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:59,200
And one of the things

2047
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,224
Teacher stamps

2048
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,528
And teach us about the old ways

2049
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,600
Yeah yeah that's not the ability to pastel memories

2050
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,624
Through race today

2051
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,184
I actually kind of think they were trying to find shamans

2052
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:14,560
I think that's what the class was really about yet I think these old ladies would come to the class

2053
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,864
They were secretly trying to find the next

2054
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,936
Okay that's what I think

2055
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
It was probably just a

2056
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Probably

2057
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,104
Fascinating thing

2058
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,640
How Republicans

2059
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,920
Hate science

2060
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,456
And yet will believe

2061
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,248
Any science that agrees with

2062
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,040
Like brunette

2063
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,624
Like anybody

2064
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:41,952
All went well and I mean more than anybody like

2065
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:45,024
Okay just go with the climate change

2066
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,816
Bulshit

2067
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,448
And let's just call that a hundred percent of scientist

2068
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:59,872
They all agree climate change is real and we can point to its effects and we can point to how is happening and we can play

2069
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:05,248
Solution but if you have one Republican points to some dumb-ass study there like

2070
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,040
Dumbass study proves it

2071
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:12,160
Everybody else thought Beyond

2072
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,464
That guy agrees with what I already

2073
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,280
Another

2074
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:20,352
Try and demonstrate

2075
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,888
The laws of thermodynamics

2076
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
Like the idea that energy is

2077
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Not

2078
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
Changed its created or destroyed

2079
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,128
Those studies inevitably

2080
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,432
Turn out that like

2081
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,200
Think about this thing

2082
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:37,760
Variable in math

2083
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:42,368
Adventures the great thing about review is available and they're like

2084
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,928
Here's your mistake and nobody's like

2085
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:52,864
Another like

2086
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
Better

2087
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
Are not on the side

2088
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:01,056
But by all means.

2089
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
Dem kok's

2090
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,640
Demco

2091
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
BuzzFeed I believe

2092
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,480
Over the weekend

2093
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,272
Sound

2094
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,040
James O'Keefe

2095
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,320
Donor list

2096
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,672
I believe I bet

2097
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,464
I bet it all comes from don't

2098
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,512
Yeah actually that's that

2099
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,912
She hates baby parts

2100
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:32,544
That was actually the Center for Medical progress but

2101
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,336
With the project veritas

2102
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,640
The highest donors

2103
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,432
Hundreds of thousands of dollars

2104
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,736
Workout Brothers pass-through

2105
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:46,624
The money directly but it was funds that they are

2106
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,416
Like in charge of the pass-through

2107
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:52,000
So people give to them and then they director

2108
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:55,840
Motorworks are winding up horse

2109
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,120
Right

2110
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:02,496
$25,000 from Gladius Maximus

2111
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,056
$50,000 from

2112
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
I guess his dad

2113
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,408
Or his brother I don't know some other Okie

2114
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
Kellum not Georgia

2115
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
Anyway

2116
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,576
Interesting position

2117
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
Right2know

2118
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
Anyway

2119
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,232
Big event

2120
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:27,328
The 3rd of people who go to art schools are in prison or commit suicide

2121
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,728
But also my girlfriend

2122
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,288
She's told me many times that a third of them went

2123
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Went to school

2124
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,080
And killed themselves

2125
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
Prison

2126
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,152
And that none of them

2127
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,432
Know anything about

2128
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,456
Space Orchard

2129
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,552
Art School

2130
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:52,416
Art school in that case would be more devastating than the battle of

2131
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
The Bulge

2132
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,864
Survive

2133
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:04,960
But you're in the s***

2134
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,776
Two of the biggest American casualties

2135
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:12,896
The Civil War many Americans died in the Civil War

2136
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:18,528
The finger paints offenses

2137
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Such b*******

2138
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,160
There are a lot of people who end up being artist out of killing themselves

2139
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
But I would argue that

2140
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
Causation

2141
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,048
And

2142
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,120
Criticize

2143
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:33,888
His ideas

2144
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,656
As we do

2145
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,192
Very right

2146
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,472
I'm assuming

2147
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,776
He seems to think that most of them are

2148
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,360
But then he goes on to talk about the past

2149
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
Criticize

2150
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,200
Clip-in

2151
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,832
It's a known fad

2152
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,744
And they show up with the crazy people

2153
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,584
Brewing stand

2154
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,168
I'm done

2155
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:11,776
Dukes of Hazzard explanation for what Alex

2156
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,312
Describing is

2157
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
Crazy

2158
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,920
Fans of his independently running into each other at and out

2159
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,784
The other one

2160
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,832
That's probably

2161
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:27,648
Neither of them actually exist

2162
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,928
I imagine

2163
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Don't have the resources

2164
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
To what

2165
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:45,824
I believe that

2166
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,920
I mean it away

2167
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Long Pond

2168
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:01,696
Still going to CIA or the FBI

2169
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:05,792
The foundation said there's the Ford Foundation there's a bunch of them Rockefeller

2170
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,272
Message with me Special Forces

2171
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,296
You did that

2172
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:32,160
The real quick real quick real quick

2173
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,464
When the clintons were in office

2174
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,744
Howard Jones

2175
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
0

2176
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
He was not

2177
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,840
It all in the mainstream Khan

2178
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,680
He came into being because of loose change

2179
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
And because of his broadcast on 9/11

2180
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,128
Show on the radio

2181
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
He was eight

2182
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,688
We we

2183
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,712
Ignorable very

2184
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,528
There's no way that I would believe that the

2185
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,344
Military

2186
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,624
That's

2187
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,416
Siri

2188
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,720
Why would you

2189
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:12,864
The Special Forces you could send National Guard Reserves man it's not hard

2190
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,144
Close to the

2191
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:15,936
Bay

2192
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,736
Call Mom work

2193
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,576
I have been messed with by the military since about 2,000

2194
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,184
They have messing with me

2195
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
And it's not fun

2196
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,168
It's not you

2197
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,960
Spider-Man dress up

2198
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,800
I haven't been messed with by the military

2199
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Cinderella 2000

2200
01:46:54,848 --> 01:47:00,992
I also have been messed with before that but since then I have also not been that

2201
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,272
A true statement

2202
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Right

2203
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,856
Nonsense

2204
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,136
What would a okay

2205
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:12,256
How would you mess

2206
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,280
With Alex Jones

2207
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:21,728
Messin With Sasquatch commercials now

01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,776
Over there just going to like

2209
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,848
Alex misrepresents a lot of the times when he's being victimized

2210
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,664
Do you mean all the time all the time

2211
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,248
I just don't I don't buy it I don't believe any of this to Foundation Park

2212
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:36,320
Foundations are f****** with him the military wasn't during the

2213
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,392
End times

2214
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,928
We're all about

2215
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
Foundation

2216
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,744
Second Foundation

2217
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,280
Forward the foundation

2218
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
All of that

2219
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,376
Most most Philip dick book

2220
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
Feature

2221
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,704
Hawaii

2222
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:57,312
Paranoia than Alex Jones

2223
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,176
I wouldn't bother with Edgar Allan Poe

2224
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
The Jordan is next

2225
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,296
Alex Jones often talks about ways you can support the Brock

2226
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,832
Lottery

2227
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:14,464
We talked about downloading the app ways we can buy pills

2228
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,792
A lot of it

2229
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,608
You can buy a billboard

2230
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,888
I would love to buy bill

2231
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:25,472
Outside of Lubbock Missouri

2232
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
So many ways

2233
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,800
You can support the infowar

2234
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,360
On this episode 22nd

2235
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,384
Alex has

2236
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,152
The cheap

2237
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:38,016
And most annoying you could possibly support the infowar

2238
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:43,136
Because all you do is keep

2239
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:49,536
Thinking about how you're going to write a book

2240
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
Shoreline

2241
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:58,752
No-see-um

2242
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:08,736
Grocery store

2243
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,880
My kids start saying

2244
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,984
So then

2245
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,872
He goes on to get into like a 2-minute ramble about like Nursery Water have fluoride in it and how

2246
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:42,016
Like I've been in a lot of been like hey lady don't get that water for your baby I'll go get the right water for you

2247
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,040
Shreveport Times of my life

2248
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,064
Like what

2249
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
You're the worst

2250
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
So am I

2251
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416
Like I can't

2252
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
Stress enough

2253
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,304
He keeps going on like

2254
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,352
Look I love your kids

2255
01:49:56,608 --> 01:50:02,752
I'm trying to help your family doing the show I love talking to you about Alex Jones

2256
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,824
If I ever go to a store and I'm like

2257
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,384
Let me tell you something about Alex Jones

2258
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
Kill me

2259
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,176
Kill me

2260
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,248
High heel mate I mean this sincerely

2261
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,528
Like I know you do

2262
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,296
If

2263
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
Anyone

2264
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
Ever

2265
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,136
In my life

2266
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,672
Stranger

2267
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:21,952
Acquaintance

2268
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Friend

2269
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,256
Family member

2270
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,792
You

2271
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,072
Was like

2272
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,376
Here's something I heard from Alex Jones

2273
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,400
I would be like

2274
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:38,080
No point arguing I got it I got to go this is why the self-checkout line was invented

2275
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
Guess what

2276
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Dehumanizing

2277
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,296
They want us to buy

2278
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,088
Produce from robots

2279
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
I'm fine with

2280
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,464
Have you ever been stuck behind an old lady in the self-checkout

2281
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,232
Machine

2282
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:59,328
You're like oh no I get why we need to get rid of Medicare

2283
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
So

2284
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:01,888
For the rest

2285
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:05,728
This episode we enter what I was what I reference at the top of

2286
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,496
The show

2287
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,776
And that is

2288
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,800
Alex ends up getting

2289
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,336
Call he doesn't get it yet

2290
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
But at this point

2291
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
Alex's

2292
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:13,664
Really

2293
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,456
Really into being right

2294
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
About economics

2295
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,528
And

2296
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,856
You start as we are in 2017

2297
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,392
Definitively

2298
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,416
He was correct

2299
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Sure

2300
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,976
Right on

2301
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,768
Inner in the summer break

2302
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,584
Do you remember when the summer

2303
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,936
Like we're looking at January 2016 we are nigh on a month away from

2304
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,216
2 years after

2305
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
And the economy is

2306
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,288
Done nothing but

2307
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,848
Stabilize and go up

2308
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,152
Are granted their out there are troubles

2309
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
Has not gone up

2310
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,016
It is not collapsed though

2311
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,552
Has gone up the economy

2312
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,320
Has stayed

2313
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:54,624
Consistently miserable for people like us

2314
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
But

2315
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
But again

2316
01:51:59,232 --> 01:51:59,744
We're not the Run

2317
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,304
No we're not

2318
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,096
It doesn't really matter

2319
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
F****** Bitcoin

2320
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,192
Everybody

2321
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,984
This is the weird thing about

2322
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,824
Conflicted about this car about our stock market system

2323
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,104
Everybody

2324
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,432
Everybody knows Bitcoin is going to collapse

2325
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,760
The people who work for Bitcoin the people who invented Bitcoin

2326
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,808
People who are investing in Bitcoin

2327
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,576
Right now

2328
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:27,136
Know that this is an unsustainable

2329
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,440
Sustainable bubble and this is going to explode

2330
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Get what you can while you can

2331
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,840
What does going to demolish people

2332
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,424
F****** retirement accounts and yet somehow

2333
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,472
Everybody's fine with this for the time being

2334
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
Far out

2335
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,896
Cryptocurrency

2336
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:49,920
And Bitcoin

2337
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:53,504
No I'm into cryptocurrency but it's worth 16,000

2338
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,552
No but but that's

2339
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:59,136
I will save it it's an illusion Subway

2340
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:05,280
Because there's a finite number of the Bitcoins they can be broken up into the smallest possible portions

2341
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:11,680
You're never going to be trying to sell one Bitcoin you'll be selling the tiny or parts of it for $20

2342
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
$40 dinner

2343
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,728
So like

2344
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
The idea that

2345
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,056
You couldn't find a buyer

2346
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:17,824
For it

2347
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:22,176
The one coin for 60,000 absolutely you're not going to find

2348
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:26,528
But you could find buyers for the smaller portions of which does give it value

2349
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,064
I don't

2350
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,624
I don't fully understand

2351
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,976
Situation but I do know that for the last 24 hours or so I've been

2352
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:35,744
Tracking

2353
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,560
Bitcoin price

2354
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,352
Do you like minute-by-minute

2355
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,632
Actuation of it

2356
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,912
Is terrifying

2357
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,448
Like as as

2358
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,752
Think I was think about it if I

2359
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,520
Have any

2360
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:48,800
Money invest

2361
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:58,528
Will bit like if you looked at it over the course of Amanita call Bronson you can do this again for the next

2362
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,064
24-hours cuz it'll repeat

2363
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
But like

2364
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:05,440
There are atlak minutes where it goes down $500 for a Bitcoin

2365
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,000
And it goes down $1,000 and then up

2366
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,048
700

2367
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:12,608
It's crazy that our ability

2368
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,656
Trading is all done by Elgar

2369
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:18,752
Right so none of that has any reflection to real people make

2370
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,032
A real decision

2371
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:23,360
That's all machines who are playing the game against

2372
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,384
It's like

2373
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,200
It's like chess computers playing chess against

2374
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,224
Another chapter

2375
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,760
By the way

2376
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:33,344
Check out alphago plus because that is the end of humanity

2377
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,928
Hours

2378
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,952
They developed

2379
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:41,536
Chess-playing computer that taught itself

2380
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,096
And now is the best chess player in the

2381
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
Picture of the universe

2382
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,400
It's incredible

2383
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,936
Pork rub

2384
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,472
We're all going to die

2385
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:53,056
About a benign

2386
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,592
Benevolent AI

2387
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,992
Has ended they will just destroy us at every sport

2388
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,088
And the AI is going to figure out how to murder Usain Bolt

2389
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
The only actual no that's a weird any results here's why I will take issue with

2390
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,792
What you're saying

2391
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
Isaac

2392
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:19,424
That you're a huge Usain Bolt

2393
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:26,592
He seems like a cool guy

2394
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,872
I get it

2395
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:34,016
The issue is the idea of benevolence within a computer or something like that maybe

2396
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,064
Destroying a lot of

2397
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
The stuff he's been

2398
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:43,232
Human calculations can't put that inside the only way to save this

2399
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,304
Human races to destroy any AI

2400
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,352
Correctly assume and then wood

2401
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,144
Begin sucking

2402
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,424
That's why

2403
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:56,800
The problem with Avengers Age of Ultron was good guy

2404
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,872
Wrestling

2405
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
Going again like we talked about this

2406
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:04,736
Doesn't it always go back to wrestling

2407
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
The hills are always

2408
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:09,344
Right

2409
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:11,392
Generally the bad guy

2410
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,672
Has a point

2411
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,952
I'm a good guy is

2412
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,232
Just some smiling jackass

2413
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:18,048
Humanity is a smiling jackass MD

2414
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,584
Harsh truth of

2415
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,632
We need to stop doing what we're doing

2416
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,448
And maybe that is

2417
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,288
We're projecting that into the minds of AI let's get off this

2418
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,824
We got to get back to collapse

2419
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,616
Economic

2420
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
Yeah yeah

2421
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:37,504
Let's get off this topic of made-up thoughts

2422
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:43,904
Who played outside

2423
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,184
This idea that you

2424
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,464
He's always been right

2425
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,744
About collapse

2426
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,424
We're p*** dealers

2427
01:56:55,936 --> 01:57:00,544
No option

2428
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,848
Consolidate control

2429
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,640
We've been proven

2430
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,968
Angela

2431
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:13,600
Living off

2432
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,392
I just think it's all funny

2433
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,304
I wish I could

2434
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:34,336
My parents have paid and help me pay my rent

2435
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,360
In times where it's been

2436
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,152
F****** real hard and I couldn't find it

2437
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,176
Joblo

2438
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,456
New comedy

2439
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:43,808
A very thrilled that they supported me in that way

2440
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,832
If you want

2441
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,856
Talk about

2442
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:50,208
That's part of it

2443
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,232
Specifically

2444
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:53,280
Vista skin color

2445
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
Changing the game

2446
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:57,888
But not necessarily due to any kind of

2447
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:00,192
Intended

2448
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,008
People Metropolitan inherent Within

2449
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,032
The system of what

2450
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,640
So if you want

2451
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,664
Your family is

2452
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,688
Statistically

2453
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:11,968
Wayla

2454
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,552
So would your parents be able to help you out in those two

2455
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:18,112
How do I mean

2456
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,392
So what are you do

2457
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:22,976
That

2458
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
My point is just

2459
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:31,680
Like just that tiny little thing that little thrown off

2460
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
Bet

2461
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,008
So many stories revolver

2462
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,080
Hey look I was in trouble

2463
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,640
And my parents were able to help me out for sure

2464
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:48,576
Have been denied so much well throughout their entire life for generation

2465
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:50,368
They don't even have access

2466
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:55,232
I got to know why just hijacked

2467
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
That but that's

2468
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,560
No

2469
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:02,144
I do recognize the luxury

2470
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,424
That I had in

2471
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,216
That sucks

2472
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,520
Because I would have rather not that been the case

2473
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,056
I would have rather

2474
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,104
Had a job

2475
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,872
When I move to

2476
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Chicago

2477
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,944
Incredibly difficult to find a job

2478
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,736
I had no connection

2479
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,272
I had no friends

2480
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,576
Friends who had jobs

2481
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,880
I had

2482
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:27,744
Most of the friends generally speaking

2483
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,280
Friends

2484
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,864
You don't have friend when I go to the restroom

2485
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,424
Acquaintance

2486
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,240
See you at bars when we tell terrible jokes

2487
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:41,056
That was it and then I moved here

2488
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,848
You know what nest egg that I thought was go

2489
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,688
It all

2490
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:51,040
You know like it was it was

2491
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:53,088
Situation where you're in over your head quicker than

2492
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
Amanda

2493
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,184
What is privilege

2494
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,488
Course I recognize it

2495
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,768
I wish

2496
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,304
Alex would recognize

2497
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:06,400
Before he points the finger you know like

2498
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,448
88888 not

2499
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
It's not

2500
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,800
Like a counterexample

2501
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568
Prosperity

2502
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,128
It's not a counterexample to

2503
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,920
His masculinity or his

2504
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:18,688
Is ego

2505
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,712
To own up to

2506
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:21,504
To the fact that he's in the position

2507
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,272
He's in

2508
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,552
Because his dad

2509
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:28,416
Got him a radio job at a critical point that would be humanizing

2510
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
Arandas Park

2511
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:34,816
Time he was like

2512
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,352
Hey you know what

2513
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:38,912
Open the door for me

2514
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:40,704
That otherwise wouldn't have been open

2515
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,752
Immediately you and I would

2516
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:44,032
Have a

2517
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
Usually differ

2518
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,360
But we would have a

2519
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:53,760
Point-of-view even playoff of you like you want me to

2520
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:58,624
He can play any game that he wanted to

2521
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392
Instead

2522
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,440
Has this ego buildup where it's like

2523
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,976
I've got everything on my own

2524
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:10,400
F*** these dumb yummies rub Mom and Dad's truck parts

2525
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,448
So insincere yeah

2526
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,592
Just bothers me or anything like that but it's just like

2527
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,456
I don't know what you do I don't know what to do with that

2528
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,528
But that level of disconnect

2529
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:28,064
From your own reality

2530
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:30,368
Okay

2531
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,280
The people who are advocating for white genocide might be said to be in

2532
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,072
That's possible

2533
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,096
You know who else isn't

2534
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,168
Advocating for not

2535
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:50,336
You didn't build your business

2536
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:57,504
Isn't strong boy

2537
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
Strong

2538
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:10,048
He doesn't this Impressions going to go onto a little while

2539
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:12,352
Eventually like it's not in this clip but he comes back

2540
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
From break and they have found the clip

2541
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,168
Any places

2542
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:25,920
A video of Obama

2543
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:27,456
Perfect

2544
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,480
Perfect grade

2545
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,784
Parody

2546
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,856
Power

2547
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,928
Conan

2548
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:37,952
Simba

2549
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:38,976
My child

2550
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:47,168
Just jumps off

2551
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,192
Compliment

2552
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,248
That describes

2553
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:25,312
Felt like

2554
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:32,480
Ridiculous weird used to deal with that

2555
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,528
Briefly

2556
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:41,952
Bye-bye pretend products because you're in a f****** cult that believe they're real

2557
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:48,352
You go get briefly tattooed on me like what would be

2558
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:51,168
That would symbolize this year of my life

2559
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:54,496
Briefly...

2560
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:57,824
It wouldn't be like it wouldn't be obviously like

2561
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,592
Like Alex Jones

2562
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:03,968
Space or something like that so that's what he knows everybody know.

2563
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:07,296
Briefly that

2564
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,368
Like some of your past 11 months

2565
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
Is of course

2566
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,952
Picture of my face screaming at you on

2567
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:16,768
Exactly what you need

2568
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,584
M40

2569
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,376
Whatever was anyway

2570
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:24,448
So I'm in this next Cliff Alex Jones

2571
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,472
Talks about his

2572
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,240
Audience

2573
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,544
At the same time like I told you

2574
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,848
We're still within this collapse

2575
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:35,968
This is within the context of

2576
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:36,736
Collapse

2577
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,088
The end

2578
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,624
Send to a weird sort of

2579
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,392
Discussion

2580
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,672
Pre-market

2581
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,720
But there's a fantasy

2582
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:47,488
That goes along with

2583
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,560
I think it has to do with beating your

2584
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,352
Your kids but I'm not entirely sure

2585
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,400
I'm not sure

2586
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:05,152
The enemy has gotten so naked about world government or planetary plan that The credibility of everyone opposing

2587
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:08,480
For a long time is exploding

2588
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:14,880
The listenership the viewership the readership I don't know I haven't asked but I bet

2589
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:19,488
A song about a guy named Michael Schneider who has the runs a Blog called

2590
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,256
Economic

2591
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,280
Collapse blog

2592
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,584
Right which is basically just

2593
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,376
You know yes these guys on her like a

2594
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:27,424
Have prepper websites and s*** like that

2595
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,496
At right it's just it's just another one

2596
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,776
Like that so that's the

2597
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,872
Because

2598
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,760
Hell

2599
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:49,696
We want

2600
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:54,304
Incredible

2601
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:00,704
The free market we've got to have children

2602
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,520
We got it a bunch of stupid arenac chumps

2603
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:08,640
Exception

2604
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:15,040
Exceptionally dumb exceptionally mindless exceptionally sick gl6 Society

Hospital

2606
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:28,352
I don't know if I've ever seen somebody describe themselves better

2607
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:37,056
He's exceptionally fat he's exceptionally simple-minded he's exceptionally all of those things

2608
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:40,896
You f****** mailed him whoop and he also is did child of privilege

2609
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:44,736
A child of prosperity if you are a therapist

2610
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,016
In that room

2611
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,296
With him while he

2612
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,064
He's describing

2613
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:52,672
Like if you were just sitting there without a controller in old water rule

2614
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,744
So tell me what you don't like about people

2615
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:56,768
He said that

2616
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,048
You just stare at her

2617
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
Heaven be like

2618
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
I don't think I

2619
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:05,728
I don't like that these trendy's have unkept

2620
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,496
Beard

2621
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:09,568
And seem to be growing their hair out never cross eye

2622
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:11,616
I don't like this.

2623
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,664
Describe myself

2624
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,528
You just described.

2625
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:20,832
So

2626
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:25,440
There's a couple things that are important to take out of there first of all this

2627
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,744
This whole mentality of like

2628
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,536
Prosperity create

2629
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,560
Really

2630
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,376
Rich Society

2631
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,168
Generation

2632
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,472
Make them work

2633
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,568
707

2634
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,104
Domestic

2635
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,664
Put it but it's also

2636
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
Cowardly Dodge

2637
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:49,504
For him cuz he's on the right side of that generation line

2638
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,552
Uno's

2639
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:53,088
I don't know what you're trying to protect

2640
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,672
Beyond that history doesn't

2641
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:59,744
Clearly show that that's the case cuz there are a bunch of

2642
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,512
Civilization

2643
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,536
Is that have generation

2644
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,328
Been prosperous over

2645
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,352
Over again

2646
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:06,144
And those are ones that

2647
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,424
Understand

2648
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,728
The in-and-out slow of resource

2649
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,544
Understand that you

2650
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,104
Need to do is create either a balance

2651
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,384
Or Surplus

2652
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,688
Coming in as opposed to those going

2653
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,456
Going out

2654
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,992
Very simple

2655
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,088
Many Native American civilizations

2656
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,928
And tribal civilizations understood thoroughly well

2657
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,000
You can create a homeostasis that that works

2658
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,024
Incredibly well

2659
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:39,168
Well it creates prosperity and doesn't deteriorate

2660
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:40,960
I mean

2661
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,240
Here's here's the

2662
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
Way2go

2663
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,288
Wee wee wrestling

2664
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,824
The dollop

2665
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,384
Listen to the podcast about the Acadia

2666
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,456
And you're going to be like oh that's the way

2667
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,224
To do it

2668
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
Jets

2669
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,040
Everything we did

2670
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,344
Is wrong

2671
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,112
Tell people

2672
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,928
Like a little bit about what you mean

2673
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:01,696
I mean

2674
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,720
Domyown

2675
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:06,048
Only 75% of the audience is going to go listen to it

2676
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:09,888
The akkadians were a group of French cafe

2677
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,912
Who came

2678
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:11,680
To Canada

2679
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,448
And

2680
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:14,496
By virtue of a

2681
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,032
Of 1

2682
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:16,800
Huge anime

2683
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,080
Wherein they

2684
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,360
Created a

2685
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,944
What would you

2686
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,296
A bulwark against

2687
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,856
Saltwater destroying everything

2688
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,136
And

2689
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,672
The necessity of

2690
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,952
Adding nutrients

2691
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,512
And they made this certain

2692
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:39,328
Situation they made a certain group of

2693
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
Certain patches

2694
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,376
So

2695
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,144
F****** good

2696
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,448
So f****** good

2697
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,032
This is great

2698
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,568
Let's do this

2699
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,616
And then everybody else got involved in

2700
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:53,664
F*** them over until they became the

2701
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,432
The Cajuns in

2702
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:59,296
There's a whole long journey down there

2703
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,576
But the point being

2704
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,112
They did something right

2705
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,928
They just had a great place to go

2706
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,024
You allowed capitalistic

2707
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,864
I mostly asked

2708
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:17,472
Because I forgot what that episode was absolutely

2709
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:22,336
You have a good situation and that does create just like you were saying a certain States

2710
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:25,920
It creates a situation where an everybody seems

2711
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
Fucken satisfy

2712
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,248
And then you allow a Kappa

2713
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,344
Yeah yeah it is it Dusty

2714
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,112
YouTube

2715
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,136
That

2716
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
On a very basic level

2717
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,280
Capitalism is

2718
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,304
News about exploitation

2719
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
Exxon

2720
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,424
And exploitation

2721
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,192
And

2722
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,264
A balance

2723
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,312
Don't really coexist well

2724
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,616
The idea of an equilibrium

2725
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:58,944
And someone trying to offset that equilibrium

2726
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,736
For their own advantage

2727
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,272
Whether or not that

2728
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,064
Attempt to get their own advantages

2729
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,600
Just right or wrong or anything like

2730
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:08,160
It just doesn't seem like those two things can

2731
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,184
Really operate

2732
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
Together

2733
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,512
I don't know what that means for our future

2734
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:16,352
Is it you think weird confluence

2735
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:21,728
I got very interest bective today

2736
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:24,288
I'm listening

2737
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,336
I suppose I got very Longview

2738
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,712
I'm just going

2739
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,736
And thinking about

2740
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:35,808
How how old is humans

2741
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:36,576
Deal with things

2742
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
And there are these

2743
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:38,880
Impulsesv

2744
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,648
That are

2745
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:42,208
You can't really describe them as good a new

2746
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,024
Bright lights

2747
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
Does

2748
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,864
Benefit everybody insofar as if

2749
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,656
Nothing is ever satisfying

2750
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,216
You're going to constantly keep f****** working

2751
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:56,800
Like with with our with any kind of artistic

2752
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:59,360
Point-of-view a lot of time

2753
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:00,128
Is one of the biggest

2754
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,712
I'm never satisfied with anything I create

2755
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:13,184
Exactly always terrible and I'm never going to do anything that's

2756
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:13,952
Good enough for my

2757
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,792
Keep trying to

2758
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:18,560
To create that

2759
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
You know

2760
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,888
In a certain way that's a good

2761
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:23,680
In another way

2762
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:29,056
That's destroying and eating my soul from the inside out and right forcing you to never actually create

2763
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:29,824
Exactly

2764
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,664
Forces you to create but never finish creating

2765
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,968
Certain products

2766
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:38,272
Finish creating it

2767
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,808
To throw it away because it's

2768
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,088
Right you know

2769
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:44,160
And that's kind of that kind of an over our

2770
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,696
Principle behind capitalism

2771
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,464
The Miz

2772
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,488
Never enough

2773
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,024
No matter what we do

2774
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,328
There's never enough wealth

2775
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:54,656
Fun that I just realized I mean basically

2776
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,448
This this thumbs up

2777
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,216
Patreon

2778
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:58,240
Right now

2779
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:00,800
What's going on with them

2780
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:06,176
I complained to you about this a little bit and it might we might as well put it out

2781
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:08,992
Just a little bit does but like a patreon

2782
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,296
Has shifted some of their fees

2783
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:14,880
Who knows they might by the time this comes out or in

2784
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,904
In the near future walk

2785
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:20,768
Chris back f****** should have done is

2786
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,560
The fees that used to be

2787
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,608
Taken out of

2788
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:26,400
Of the things people donate it

2789
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,704
I have shifted over to

2790
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,240
The people who are donating

2791
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:33,824
And they started charging people

2792
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
Ascertain

2793
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,896
A donation as opposed to

2794
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:39,968
For all of the things that they donate to

2795
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:43,808
So it's specifically screwing over the people who give little donation

2796
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:46,880
To a bunch of people will end up

2797
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,928
Cannibalizing probably

2798
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:50,464
The capacity of people

2799
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,512
To support creative projects

2800
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:56,352
But in doing so if you look at the the metrics new look

2801
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:57,888
The man

2802
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:01,984
They will make so much more money

2803
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:02,752
Or for you

2804
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,336
And to that extent

2805
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,360
I don't want

2806
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:10,176
Anyone who wants to support the show to give

2807
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:14,272
More money for them if you want to leave our

2808
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:20,672
Please feel free to come up with something new

2809
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:24,256
Capital are so grateful to everybody who don't

2810
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,048
And if you decide

2811
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,864
Not just to not do this

2812
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,680
Because economically

2813
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:32,448
To do this

2814
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,728
Do this

2815
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:34,752
Philosophic

2816
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:40,640
We love everything that you've done for us

2817
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:44,224
We care so much about you and help you stop donating

2818
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,552
We're going to be on your side which is a weird thing for us to say

2819
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:52,160
It's that miscalculation that I think patreon did they

2820
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:54,720
Your customers

2821
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:56,768
That's not that's not

2822
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:57,536
No

2823
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,840
This is a donation this isn't

2824
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:02,912
It's a support I mean cigarettes you know technically

2825
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,704
You would think like this is

2826
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,240
Yeah

2827
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,264
I don't know

2828
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,032
I don't know

2829
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:11,360
I think the I think the biggest issue that we have is

2830
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:14,432
And they're the ones

2831
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,200
Yeah

2832
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:16,224
A hundred percent

2833
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:18,528
The part where

2834
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,296
Creator

2835
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,064
It becomes

2836
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,136
Incredibly difficult because we do need support

2837
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:24,672
And we appreciate your support

2838
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:28,256
But now I don't feel great asking for it in this way right

2839
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:34,656
So if you'd like some for the show.

2840
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:39,776
Future for the time being

2841
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,080
Ewok

2842
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:43,616
That

2843
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:50,016
What did Alex it right there my son feel free to go to PayPal freezing point at gmail

2844
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:56,672
Yeah anyway let's move on we're going to figure out a way for this to work out

2845
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:00,000
The point the reason that I bounced off what you were saying

2846
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:02,560
Disgusted

2847
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:05,120
Because that is unnecessary

2848
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,656
Influence of Kappa

2849
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,192
They need

2850
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:08,960
2

2851
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,984
Make more money

2852
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:12,032
I assume there's some

2853
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:17,152
Pressure from the higher-ups or something like that

2854
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:23,552
To jump in and they're like nobody got a whatever-it-is naked

2855
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,832
Did cash grab attempt

2856
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:27,136
That is undermining the

2857
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:27,904
Purpose of

2858
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,672
Thanks

2859
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,696
That is

2860
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:31,232
That's capitalism

2861
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,256
You got it

2862
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:33,280
You got it

2863
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,840
Anyway I haven't sex with Alex Jones

2864
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,400
Still

2865
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:42,240
He's still trying to

2866
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:44,288
The push is a disaster

2867
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,312
Narratives

2868
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,408
What's going to happen now

2869
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:53,248
When the welfare checks still go out when the EBT card still work

2870
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:03,232
With this ignorant

2871
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:05,280
Domesticated population

2872
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:11,424
The Pentagon estimates

2873
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:17,824
Most people kill

2874
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:21,920
Begin within 15 days

2875
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,296
I am

2876
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:31,392
Thought I would work the last time we talked about

2877
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:33,952
I only brought it back in because

2878
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,488
He's really ramping

2879
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,512
Through this like

2880
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:38,048
He's talking to this guy

2881
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:39,328
Run the block called

2882
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:41,120
Economic collapse blog.com

2883
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
Gran Torino

2884
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,448
Any pushing these

2885
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:45,984
I'm pretty hard about the collapse

2886
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:46,752
You know like

2887
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,288
I've been right all the time

2888
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,080
I've been right

2889
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,360
People are starved

2890
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,200
The contact

2891
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:56,224
Snowmageddon

2892
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,504
The East Coast

2893
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:03,904
So when you talk about like there's no food on the shelves

2894
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,256
No I don't I remember distinctly

2895
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,280
The new thing

2896
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:11,840
Cannibalism

2897
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,888
But him being like there's no food on the show

2898
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:16,704
Xavier

2899
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:19,520
Tell me how that works when I was a kid we had a hurricane

2900
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,312
It was a gonna hit our Island

2901
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,408
Very little food on the shelves

2902
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,248
We stocked up and then

2903
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,320
We finally about

2904
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:34,368
That's the one that's a big

2905
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:38,464
Psychological

2906
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,512
Which is

2907
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,816
We will know

2908
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,864
They're a little bit

2909
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,632
Better than

2910
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:51,264
Like that's one of those like that's one of those things where you can go into any

2911
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,032
Play small town

2912
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,056
Andaz

2913
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,616
Well as they get along with each other

2914
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,688
They will you know your family will thing

2915
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,760
Yeah we're good people

2916
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,088
We don't know what those other people are going to do

2917
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:11,744
Hannibal Missouri thinks they're better than Mexico Missouri Joplin thinks they're better than her all up

2918
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:12,768
People are

2919
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,072
Mystically people are

2920
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
Kind of

2921
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:16,864
Cool with each

2922
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:19,168
We just don't understand that

2923
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:20,448
Disasters

2924
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:21,984
Situation almost everybody

2925
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,520
Ends up default

2926
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,824
They want to help

2927
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:32,992
The reality of a disaster remind you of the humanity of your comps

2928
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:39,392
Exactly cuz you start to realize how scared you are and you start to respect everybody

2929
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:44,256
All of those all of those posts

2930
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:45,280
Apocalyptic

2931
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,304
Future movies

2932
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:48,608
Like what there should be is

2933
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:51,168
Communities working their ass off

2934
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,472
Like you go to

2935
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:55,008
Go to Puerto Rico

2936
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:55,776
Right now

2937
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,312
They are not being held

2938
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,592
They are not being

2939
02:19:59,104 --> 02:19:59,872
Care of in the way that they

2940
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,432
Because every single one of those people

2941
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:04,736
Every single one of them are American

2942
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,272
And I'll be goddamned

2943
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,040

Everybody help

2945
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:10,368
And yet no one

2946
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:11,392
Eating each other

2947
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:14,208
Weird

2948
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:14,976
Power

2949
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,512
They don't have water

2950
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:17,536
There's no cannibalism in

2951
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:18,816
Nope

2952
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
Weird

2953
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,120
Everybody's just trying to fuc

2954
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:21,888
Can get through it

2955
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,192
We finally get to

2956
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:24,960
Caller

2957
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,264

White

2961
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:33,920
But the rest of it

2962
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:35,712
Play on Broadway

2963
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:36,736
My kind of collar

2964
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:43,392

Unlimited money

2972
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:18,208
Most worlds already in Civil War

02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,120
Good

2983
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:57,888
Question

2984
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:00,704
I guess I probably have to do it politely or else out

2985
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:05,824
But the question being you

2986
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,384
Which

2987
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:14,016
Over the course of our history doing this show and read to jump back

2988
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,040
2014

2989
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:15,808
2015

2990
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,088
2012

2991
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:23,488
We just 2001-2004 maybe he saw it

2992
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:29,888
2008, I'm just going to allow that and ignore it

2993
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:30,656
Like we just

2994
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:31,680
Compton

2995
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:34,240
It's about to go down

2996
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:35,520
And he has these

2997
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:37,312
Janti weird

2998
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:42,944
Very differently motivated Financial experts on

2999
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,224
Yeah it is

3000
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,992
Brighton

3001
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:47,552
So this guy's question is

3002
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:48,576
Is real valid like

3003
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:51,136
To the point where help have a

3004
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,672
That just come

3005
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,440
Bigot

3006
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,512
Bigot bigot

3007
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:02,144
It's like an ingot

3008
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,704
The guy's question is

3009
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,984
They meant leave out

3010
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:09,312
Why should we

3011
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:11,104
When you have for years

3012
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:17,760
Been prophesying a huge under written and broadcasted vehicles

3013
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:18,528
Operation

3014
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:20,832
Why should we

3015
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:22,112
And so they go to commercial

3016
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:23,136
Roman Atwood comes back

3017
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:31,584
All of your past predictions

3018
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:34,144
I like the one we had before

3019
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:39,008
Unlimited

3020
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:49,504
2020

3021
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:59,232
2 years ago

3022
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:03,840
This is all that stuff that we talked about on episode couple months

3023
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,376
Weebly

3024
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:07,424
Misrepresenting all of this

3025
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:11,776
Army.mil

3026
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:19,456
Armored vehicle

3027
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,040
Sure

3028
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,600
We got the secret document

3029
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:35,584
When was beyond one piece of this is that arm

3030
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,120
Me. Mill documents

3031
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,400
Use completely misrepresent

3032
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:40,704
And the other part of it is

3033
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:43,008
Statistics of shounen last

3034
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,800
Since 9/11

3035
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:47,360
Yeah

3036
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,944
The tuna like 70% of domestic terrorism

3037
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:52,480
Events have been White

3038
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:56,320
I'm sure there are some Islamic

3039
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,344
Focus

3040
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,416
Minority comparative Lee

3041
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:04,768
Law enforcement agencies would

3042
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,304
Put out memos weather like

3043
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,888
They keep shooting cop

3044
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:13,216
And stuff like that it's not or the idea that

3045
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:16,032
Is tragic as it is

3046
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:16,800
Cuz I

3047
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:20,384
The perpetrators or victims themselves

3048
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:24,480
The idea of returning veteran being

3049
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:25,760
Shell shocked

3050
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:29,600
Which is not a real thing

3051
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:35,488
Killing their spouses or

3052
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,560
Were they at Shell Shocked they were right

3053
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:44,448
But the idea of Department being aware of that being deaf

3054
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:46,240
The factory

3055
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:48,800
In the Modern Warfare scenario

3056
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,592
They are trained in

3057
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,616
Improvised

3058
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:53,664
Explosives

3059
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:56,224
That doesn't seem that weird to me

3060
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,504
That doesn't seem like

3061
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,784
Biased

3062
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,552
Seems like

3063
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:00,832
Cops being prepared

3064
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:02,112
In general

3065
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:02,880
Tumi

3066
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,672
The way to deal with

3067
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,440
American

3068
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:06,976
Is

3069
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:08,256
First off

3070
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:10,048
If you are hearing about it

3071
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:11,584
That means

3072
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:12,864
Novel

3073
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:14,912
Right

3074
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:16,960
Second

3075
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:17,728
Sexy

3076
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,032
It's fitting a narrative

3077
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:20,800
It's already

3078
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:22,848
Pre-programmed

3079
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,152
So that's why because it's

3080
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:31,808
MSNBC supposedly supposed to be somehow related

3081
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:33,856
2

3082
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:36,928
Picking up the same narrative that you have

3083
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,696
Fox News

3084
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:39,232
Because Fox News

3085
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:42,304
They pick up sexy f****** Meredith

3086
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:44,096
The idea of

3087
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:45,376
White terrorism

3088
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:48,192
That's not really talked about because

3089
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,216
It's not novel

3090
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:55,616
Mary Tyler Moore

3091
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:58,944
Play vava post 9/11 America wherein were terrified of

3092
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:02,528
Write write write those two things going on

3093
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:05,344
Filter every bit of your news through

3094
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,880
If I'm hearing about this

3095
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,928
This is probably not a frequent thing

3096
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,720
And if I'm hearing about this

3097
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:12,512
And it fits in a narrative

3098
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:13,792
Probably not

3099
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,632
That's generally how it works

3100
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,936
I think that's fair

3101
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:23,008
Like everything they don't do anything successful

3102
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,056
Stay inconvenience everybody

3103
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:27,104
Edit the cartel and everybody can go for

3104
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:32,736
I also hear that the TSA is on the road

3105
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,320
Begging 3000

3106
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:42,976
We have one more clip

3107
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:47,840
And

3108
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:51,936
Getting really defensive

3109
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:52,960
About this caller

3110
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:55,520
Who's called why is this any different

3111
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:56,800
If your other collapse

3112
02:27:57,568 --> 02:28:00,128
Any defensive last whip over here

3113
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,152
Lying about

3114
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:03,456
About internment camps

3115
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,992
The cops

3116
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:06,528
Trying to get

3117
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:08,064
Like beat like hey

3118
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,160
White people are as likely or more likely to be

3119
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:13,952
People who

3120
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,768
100

3121
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:17,792
But even that

3122
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,584
Is 7 years old

3123
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:21,120
Like that is not

3124
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:22,144
Current

3125
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,960
Somebody's using these narratives which are lies

3126
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:26,752
That are irrelevant

3127
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:27,776
The topic at hand

3128
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,568
To bolster his like

3129
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:34,944
This time the collapse narrative that I'm pitching is real right when in the course of this

3130
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:35,712
Podcast

3131
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:36,480
The return of

3132
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:37,504
Last year we heard him

3133
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,784
Push back

3134
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,832
Disasters coming this fall

3135
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:42,880
Sorry winter

3136
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:48,000
Over and over again

3137
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:49,536
She's coming on December 9th

3138
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,816
19

3139
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:52,096
Set of December

3140
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,400
I read the prophecy

3141
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:56,192
I'm mixing two points

3142
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:57,728
Sort of intention

3143
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:58,752
Because

3144
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,056
She is as well like

3145
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,592
One point is

3146
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:03,872
He is guilty

3147
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:05,152
He does this all the

3148
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,456
But the other part is

3149
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:09,760
There's a problem that I'm going on is

3150
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:12,832
He's bringing up the relevant other lies

3151
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:15,392
In order to bolster the economic collapse

3152
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:21,024
The economic Lifeline unrelated to the idea of army.mil

3153
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:25,376
Creating the Kentucky Fried Chicken Double Down

3154
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:29,216
And so he has to bring it together and he tries to

3155
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:29,984
With a

3156
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:31,264
Dumb metaphor

3157
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:34,336
And then we find out what is really behind

3158
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,384
Something

3159
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:37,920
You and I

3160
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:39,712
You add pivot me

3161
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:40,480
Swear to God.

3162
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:42,016
I promise you there's no app

3163
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:42,784
But

3164
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:46,880
We already know

3165
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,928
We already know what's

3166
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
Spells it out

3167
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,000
Embarrassing way

3168
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,048
Ted Koppel

3169
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:06,336
So first of all I didn't deposit their butt

3170
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:08,128
I do need to point out that like what

3171
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:08,896
Houston

3172
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:11,456
You know he's going to invade in 1930

3173
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:17,856
Whatever you know it's going to happen eventually

3174
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,904
Kind of mentality

3175
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:20,928
Credible

3176
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:22,208
Cuz it's just like

3177
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:24,256
I'll eventually be right

3178
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:25,792
Like if

3179
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,328
I don't believe

3180
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,864
Wholeheartedly in Bitcoin

3181
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:30,400
Louis talk about this

3182
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,168
A little bit already

3183
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:34,752
Right I think there's a lot of variability to it I don't fully understand

3184
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:36,544
But for me to say

3185
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,848
Bitcoin will collapse

3186
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:40,640
If I keep saying that

3187
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,664
Long enough

3188
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:45,760
Eventually there will be a big falling it right and I could say

3189
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:47,552
I knew it all along

3190
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:48,832
And that's the game Alex

3191
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,600
Is playing now

3192
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:51,136
That's what he's saying like

3193
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:55,488
It's like saying you know it's going to happen eventually and now it happen

3194
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:01,120
Well the speakers Back to the Future

3195
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:02,912
Bitcoin will collapse

3196
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:08,032
But if I told you I knew when it would happen or I knew House part

3197
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:12,896
The summer of Ray

3198
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:15,712
But I can tell you right now

3199
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:17,760
It's not worth what it's worth right now

3200
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:19,808
Everybody's going to find out

3201
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,600
I don't know when

3202
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,904
I don't know how much it's not worth how much

3203
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:27,488
You don't like I don't know anything other than

3204
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,024
Mathematically

3205
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,304
That's how work

3206
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,072
Right right

3207
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:34,400
I just really

3208
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:36,192
Respect the idea of the Ark

3209
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:36,960
You meant that like

3210
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:38,752
You know it

3211
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:39,776
Habit eventually

3212
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:42,336
You know I will be right eventually

3213
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:44,640
Everything

3214
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,944
Especially with any Market

3215
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:49,248
Believe me when white genocide happen

3216
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,016
People are going to

3217
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:51,296
Today Show

3218
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:54,112
Holyshit

3219
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:56,160
Like I could say right now like

3220
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:58,208
Potatoes are overvalued

3221
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:01,536
I just choose a random commodity

3222
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,304
Are you

3223
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:04,352
Find Cabot

3224
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:05,376
We lived

3225
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:07,168
Through that okay cabbage

3226
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:09,216
Alright

3227
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:10,240
Like produce

3228
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:11,264
To be like

3229
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:14,080
Eventually the bottom is going to fall out of this Market

3230
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:16,896
And I just keep saying and then when it goes up

3231
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:17,664
I could be like

3232
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,992
It's over inflated at guys need to understand

3233
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:26,880
If everyone everyone's into cabbage right now but they don't understand the realities of the Cabbage Market

3234
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:29,184
If it's a bulshit game

3235
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,232
You're you're describing the fluctuation

3236
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:32,256
As though something

3237
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,072
Bright

3238
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:39,936
Soros runs around saying Run for the Hills call Addison

3239
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:49,920
Axalta misrepresenting the world

3240
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:56,576
Floating things

3241
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:58,112
Congressman from Georgia stash

3242
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,720
Highway 4

3243
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:05,280
Stop by tectonic

3244
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:06,560
And

3245
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:19,360
Dublin

3246
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:23,456
I'd like to take a step back into save death kind of always the

3247
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,016
It should

3248
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:27,808
Be with love for it not to be

3249
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:29,600
But

3250
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:30,624
Atlee

3251
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,904
International strife

3252
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:33,952
Kind of

3253
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:36,000
Freeway

3254
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:36,768
Everybody would have

3255
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,560
Come together grade 1 worth

3256
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:41,120
Government beta band of capitalism

3257
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:44,960
When go up

3258
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,056
Asher talking about

3259
02:33:49,312 --> 02:33:49,824
I don't know

3260
02:33:50,592 --> 02:33:52,640
2 years ago restaurants in Austin

3261
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,984
Where is it at

3262
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:22,080
Southern up

3263
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:29,760
So

3264
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:31,552
What we get there

3265
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:34,880
Smorgasbord

3266
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:39,744
But did the concrete evidence that Alex has that the economy is a disaster

3267
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:43,072
Is vague ideas about Austin restaurant

3268
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:44,352
Which I take it

3269
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:45,632
Because I don't

3270
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,168
I don't know

3271
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:48,192
What information

3272
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:50,240
And the other being

3273
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:51,520
What is audiences

3274
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:52,544
Tripled in the last

3275
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:54,080
Not true

3276
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:55,104
If it is

3277
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:56,896
Because of Russian Bots

3278
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:59,712
It's the same. Of time

3279
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:02,528
The Russian influence campaign

3280
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:03,552
Started you know what

3281
02:35:04,064 --> 02:35:07,904
I would say he's even lying about that I think his audiences only double

3282
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:10,976
Like the Russians wouldn't even have the gall to Triple is

3283
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:13,792
Go with the triple let's just go with it

3284
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:18,656
Simplicity time influence camp

3285
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:22,496
Started in their summer early summer of 2015

3286
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:24,800
Afraid

3287
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:26,848
His audience has traveled

3288
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:30,176
And is that

3289
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:30,944
You takes

3290
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,248
Economy the disaster

3291
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,784
No one has any more money

3292
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,808
To give me right

3293
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,856
He's basing this

3294
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:39,136
Collapse

3295
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:42,976
They called all the indicators say that the economy is

3296
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:45,024
Stabilizing or doing better

3297
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:51,424
But I have tons of yours and no one's giving me money right that's f***** up that's the only thing he has to go on for this

3298
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,448
Entire episode

3299
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:53,984
Is just all this like

3300
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,520
F*** you there's going to be

3301
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:58,592
Cannibals 15 days from now

3302
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,616
Because

3303
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:01,152
So congratulations Alex

3304
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:01,920
You

3305
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:05,248
Unfortunately prove you are not a Russian agent

3306
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:08,064
By virtue of the fact that you are

3307
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,344
Influence by Russian

3308
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:10,624
Do you

3309
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:12,416
100%

3310
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:15,488
Being bolstered by phakic

3311
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:18,560
His traffic is being inflated artificial

3312
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:21,120
Obviously it by

3313
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:25,216
Amigo listen to any of our other episodes where he

3314
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:29,824
Russian narratives about Syria

3315
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,152
Like it it's just he is a Russian propaganda

3316
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,688
Without being Russian

3317
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:37,248
Fry time so obviously they would want to bolster

3318
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:39,296
For his position

3319
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,064
Is prominence

3320
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:42,368
I do that

3321
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:44,672
And it's clear

3322
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:46,976
It's clear that is where he is like

3323
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,256
Indisputable

3324
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,280
But but but

3325
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:51,328
Here are the two things I want to

3326
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,096
Canvas episode

3327
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:53,888
The first thing is

3328
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:56,192
The intense

3329
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:56,960
To the wicked witch

3330
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:57,984
He thought that

3331
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,008
The economy was

3332
02:36:59,264 --> 02:36:59,776
Collapsing

3333
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:01,056
At the beginning of 20

3334
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,360
That led him to be

3335
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:04,640
We must

3336
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
Support Trump

3337
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,176
Or die

3338
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,224
Is largely based

3339
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:08,992
On Amazon

3340
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,528
Standing but he has

3341
02:37:10,784 --> 02:37:11,552
Of his own number

3342
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:14,880
I think

3343
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:16,160
That there's a chance

3344
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:21,280
Are you know what this is f***** up because you and I go through this thing over and over again

3345
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:22,560
World like there's a chance

3346
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:24,096
Alex could have saved him

3347
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:26,912
I don't like no

3348
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,472
I believe that there's a possibility

3349
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,800
Had the Russian Bots not been inflating his traffic

3350
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:36,640
To think that he's becoming one of the most popular things in the world

3351
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:39,712
There's a chance that Alex could have been moderate

3352
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:40,736
In

3353
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:41,760
His support of Troy

3354
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,808
What is Ben like

3355
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:45,344
But you can't prove it

3356
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:49,184
I can't get right back into it but I think there's a chance

3357
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:53,280
Because at this time even in even in January he

3358
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,048
You still

3359
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:56,352
You know his toes in the water with

3360
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,120
Cruise

3361
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,656
Is how is in the water with

3362
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:03,008
Rampalli which is more of an a******

3363
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:05,056
Sing that he's just going to be amongst

3364
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:06,080
In a

3365
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:08,128
Because

3366
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:09,152
He's been Duke

3367
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:10,432
Right

3368
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:13,504
And I'm not a different mom

3369
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,784
I'm not trying to say

3370
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:19,392
He's a f****** a****** in a racist no matter

3371
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,672
But I think in

3372
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:21,696
In terms of

3373
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:22,464
The interest

3374
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,232
For history

3375
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:24,768
What he has done

3376
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:26,560
Goodway he

3377
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:28,608
Like as a rocket-propelled

3378
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:30,400
Entity

3379
02:38:31,936 --> 02:38:32,704
Supporting Trump

3380
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,496
To the point of being like

3381
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:36,288
We will die if we don't

3382
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:37,056
Support him

3383
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:39,104
I think without that

3384
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:40,384
Tripling of his audience

3385
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:42,688
He wouldn't have been confused

3386
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,992
Like the economy is a disaster

3387
02:38:45,248 --> 02:38:48,064
Halves

3388
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:49,600
Pink

3389
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:52,928
I don't know

3390
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:54,720
I wish for a better way

3391
02:38:58,048 --> 02:39:00,352
Incoming

3392
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,424
Now here's my punchline

3393
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:05,728
This is from

3394
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:08,288
December 5th 2017

3395
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,104
And this relates to

3396
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,128
The knowledge

3397
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,408
Is that we clearly have

3398
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:15,712
That Alex Jones is audience

3399
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:16,992
Supported

3400
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,528
Slated by Rush

3401
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:21,856
No keeping mine

3402
02:39:22,368 --> 02:39:22,880
In March

3403
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:24,416
2017

3404
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:26,464
Adam Schiff

3405
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,488
Suggested that I

3406
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,256
Alex Jones

3407
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:29,536
Was working for Russia

3408
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:33,632
Got really drunk on air and called the c*********

3409
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:35,168
And said I'll beat your ass

3410
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:37,472
You son-of-a-b**** feel your hand that sort of s***

3411
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:38,240
Which

3412
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:40,288
Again still your hand

3413
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
Here's what Alex said on the

3414
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:50,528
Showing it

3415
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:56,416
But telling me

3416
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,208
But pathetic

3417
02:39:58,464 --> 02:39:58,976
There you are

3418
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,512
If I was one

3419
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:01,536
I didn't know it

3420
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,304
Didn't know it

3421
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,072
Great

3422
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:05,120
Please hide behind that math Galaxy

3423
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:10,752
He'll probably keep you from being prosecuted but

3424
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:16,640
For someone who before was like I will beat your ass for saying I had anything to do with Russia

3425
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:21,760
I didn't know

3426
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:24,064
Why would you tell him

3427
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:29,184
If you tell him he's going to tell everybody

3428
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,744
So congratulations Alex I think

3429
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:32,512
You are

3430
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:34,304
Very clearly

3431
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:37,120
Pawn

3432
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,400
Stomach pain

3433
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:40,192
Dum dum game

3434
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:43,264
That took only one

3435
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,800
Yes certainly

3436
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:46,592
But your part in it

3437
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:48,896
Wow

3438
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:52,480
All it took was listening to U2 done Ravel

3439
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:55,296
It's one of those things where

3440
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,672
Kind of wanted to get bad enough

3441
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,440
To where

3442
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:03,232
Affects him to the point where you at

3443
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,584
Like I almost I almost want us

3444
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:10,144
I almost want to be in a homeless shelter

3445
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,960
Next to Alex Jones just so I can hear him

3446
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:15,520
Yeah I wasn't I was like

3447
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,336
I think he

3448
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:22,176
I don't know if he'll ever say that but he will end up

3449
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:23,200
Having to

3450
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,224
Like

3451
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:25,760
Get right with

3452
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:26,528
God.

3453
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,600
But like

3454
02:41:31,136 --> 02:41:32,160
The things that are coming down

3455
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:32,928
Pipe

3456
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
In terms of

3457
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:35,488
The investigation

3458
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:37,280
Bedtime Euler's doing

3459
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:38,816
Right in terms of

3460
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,096
I mean

3461
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:41,632
Outlook

3462
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:44,704
Weeks or so

3463
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,264
We've had two people be indicted

3464
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,032
One of them

3465
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:49,824
We've had

3466
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:56,224
Strong indications

3467
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,272
Unwound eventual

3468
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:00,576
Seems like a total mess

3469
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,344
Is because there's in

3470
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,880
Information that the public doesn't

3471
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:04,672
That the investigators do

3472
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:06,976
And when that invented vet information

3473
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:08,000
Comes public

3474
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:10,048
A lot of it will become much more

3475
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,864
I think it will

3476
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,400
And I think Alex Jones

3477
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:15,680
Recognizes

3478
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:16,448
Is that

3479
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:20,032
In March

3480
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,312
When he was mad

3481
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:23,104
Screaming I will beat your ass

3482
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:24,384
If you call me a Russian

3483
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,944
You didn't have an awareness

3484
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:27,968
F***

3485
02:42:28,736 --> 02:42:29,760
I was probably apart

3486
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:31,808
And now

3487
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:32,832
I think you realize

3488
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,368
Like based on

3489
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,136
That

3490
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:35,904
Sentence

3491
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:36,672
Right

3492
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:40,768
Very clearly I'm saying if I was I didn't know it

3493
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:45,632
Space alien is obviously fax them a Russian Nation

3494
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,192
He would never have said

3495
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:51,776
I think

3496
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,824
What's going to happen is he's going to have

3497
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,360
How to create a new layer of b*******

3498
02:42:56,896 --> 02:42:58,944
And I mean we'll see what that is but I don't think I'll ever

3499
02:42:59,456 --> 02:42:59,968
Is wrong

3500
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:03,808
