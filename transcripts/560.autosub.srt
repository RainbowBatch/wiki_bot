00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
And also

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,936
Disguise Alex Jones

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
That wasn't me to bring attention to that tub

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
Pahrump

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
Jordan

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
What's up

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
I survived

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
An ordeal that would destroy

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
A lesser version

15
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
End of myself

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
I ordered some food

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
Delivery

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
And I went downstairs

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
2

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
To get it

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
And I luck

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Myself out

23
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,400
Locked myself out of the house at about 9:30 in the evening

24
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
And I was too

25
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Terrified

26
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
I do my landlord's not going to come over I don't even know who my landlord is out last night.

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
I can't

28
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Break into my window cuz it

29
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,600
It's not on the bottom floor that I have that kind of Parkour ability

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,720
To scale the building

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Which is never Gray

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Are all dark

33
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,448
Everything is going to hit the buzzer in like week somebody off

34
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
That seems like too much

35
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
So I walked around the side of the building

36
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
And I saw someone's TV on

37
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,248
Exactly they both be at but I was so terrified there's like

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
I've got my food but now I guess I'll be out there

39
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,464
Are the eating and sleeping out on the in the alley tonight

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
It wasn't too bad yeah that's

41
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072
It's true and that might have been part of the reason why I forgot my keys

42
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,400
Cuz it just looked like a

43
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
Sandals

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
How dare you I know you're not a another saying at those Clippers

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Okay.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
Vibrate spot dead is currently as we speak

47
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
Goes the Eurovision song contest

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
I know every year

49
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
What the f*** no you don't know I don't know I've never really even watched it before but this is the first time that I've really

50
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
We decided to dig in and watch some Eurovision

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
And it is

52
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Just

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Universally terrible music

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,640
The Patty Murray is amazing given an airplane Hangar to do whatever they want

55
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
And they create some

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
Ridiculous spectacle from what I understand I don't know too much about Eurovision but from what I understand it's pretty serious

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Country against

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Country

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,256
Most most everybody is

60
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Doing like a

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,912
You know how Americans invented good music they're all doing that

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
But you know through there like her through their own lens

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Tracker

64
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
But some countries

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Their own s*** and it's really really good

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Is garbage nobody has a good

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Slide it's just

68
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Tragic

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
There's like shows everywhere

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
So Jordan

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,071
Speaking of light shows I would like to let you look into my disco balls

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
It is actually a Time

73
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Machine

74
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
We're going back in time

75
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
Beer where we up to today mr. Peabody

76
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,359
Today we are going to May 12th and 13th 2000

77
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
3

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Continuing back in art

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Exploration of Alex Jones

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
2003

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Primarily what he's all about

82
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
What are some similarities what are some differences where's the devil at

83
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
I mean

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Definitely one of the biggest

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Discretion

86
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Does Alex Jones believe he's fighting the devil

87
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
In 2003

88
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
Steve Dennis dreams been a little bit muddled and a secondary element of that question is

89
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Does Alex

90
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,967
Believe he's fighting the devil and actively try to hide that from his presentation

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
In order to be taken more seriously

92
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
At this point in his career

93
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
Start at the beginning of May 2003 we're now you're coming to the middle of the month

94
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
I think it's still an open

95
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Question

96
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
And Bullard a little bit more today

97
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
Call Robert Verdugo

98
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:35,871

108
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199

Ewok names that are

Really that one actually almost hits me in the gut a little bit

113
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
That one that's a little bit like I get off your high horse okay

114
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263

Thanks good

119
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
Jordan in the past

120
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
I should say that something's happening in the present but not just

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
Wright's not just your visit

122
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559

Happy birthday

131
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Throwbacks

132
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Ethan

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,903
Mary sent a message wanted to wish you Happy Birthday over the weekend hope you hope you have a

134
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Happy birthday

135
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,095
We start here on the 12th and it is a slug

136
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
It is a rough time

137
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
The beginning

138
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
Actual news

139
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
And that is where we will jump

140
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
I mean they're really

141
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
So just a quick reminder the LA Times editorial that Alex is talking about did not say that McCarthy was right it was infectious

142
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,919
Steven, condemnation of McCarthy and his tactics and a plea not to throw it all opposition

143
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Communism

144
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Just based on how big a piece

145
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
He's a s*** he was

146
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
So maybe journalistic Outlet Darkness

147
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Pervious Houston

148
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Presenting options based on headlines what you think

149
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,743
Things are then maybe

150
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
Sorry label to find this article that Alex is talking about in the LA Times about textbook

151
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
Hey by Diane ravitch an author whose work is almost

152
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
Exclusively about education related issues

153
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,615
The first thing to point out is that this much like the other article I'll excite is an editorial

154
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Rabbit is writing in the

155
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
The first person

156
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
It's not a piece of straight

157
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Reporting

158
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
Around this time in history rival should just released a book titled the language police how pressure groups were strict with students

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,767
The book was about half beer of the ignited controversy from both left and right wing pressure groups has led to text

160
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
To give students an incomplete View

161
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Subjects like history and literature

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
In her article for the time she says quote

163
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
The textbooks go out of their way to sanitize the very practices and non-western cultures

164
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
That they rightly condemned in RC

165
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Society

166
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
Branstad's every textbook acknowledges that the enslavement of Africans by the West

167
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
With a great crime

168
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
However went

169
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,831
Describing slavery in the Middle East or Africa many claim that is a path to Upward career Mobility or a chance

170
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
To join a new family

171
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Slavery is wrong in any time and place

172
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Contribute recognized as such

173
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
That's a fair enough point but I want to make sure that we illuminate had this criticism is different than that it's Lobby by someone

174
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Unlike Alex

175
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
Alex doesn't want all cultures be represented accurately with proper historical

176
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Contact

177
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
He would want the Middle Eastern or African

178
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
Slavery discuss

179
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,687
But he would also want the textbooks to ignore American slavery where they had to cover it

180
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
The focus should be on how America actually ended

181
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,599
Flavored know it was if it weren't for white people we never would have ended slavery everybody knows this

182
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Ravages pointing out certain textbooks

183
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
That she's read that are lazy

184
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Alex just doesn't want history to make

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Can feel bad

186
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
It would make him sleep

187
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
Specific difference

188
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,495
Yeah yeah you know if you're if you're quoting Thomas Jefferson incorrectly all the time but it's like

189
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,383
Hey I'm Thomas Jefferson I love having slaves it make you free feel like maybe the founding fathers were very smart

190
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
Also I wouldn't like this paragraph in the Times article

191
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
The histories treatment of religion is scandalous

192
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,951
The origin stories of each religion or accounted as if they were documented history rather than religious myths

193
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,279
Many Publishers have Multicultural advisory boards to ensure the text

194
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Books contain only positive facts about religion or ethnic

195
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Snickers

196
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
Suspected Alexandria Duvall articles

197
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Something definitely would not like

198
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
The suggestion that is religious beliefs are a myth

199
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
Also backflip that we listen to music

200
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
1/2 hour AIDS

201
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
The show it

202
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
A real it was walking through molasses

203
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Yeah yeah that's not

204
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Good it was to

205
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Brick 88 bit started up

206
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
A half an hour

207
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Really

208
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Interesting stuff that

209
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
What about

210
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
But going back in time and look

211
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
These episodes

212
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
This is such a good example of like

213
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
Being able to go in different direction

214
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Learning about enter

215
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Interesting stuff

216
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Like this

217
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Murder

218
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
1 mi

219
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Okay

220
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Alright

221
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,639
What's going on here is that Alex's glossing over an amazing story

222
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,991
Just to make it valuable to his worldview when in fact it doesn't really work at all

223
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
The IRA member in question here is a double agent for British intelligence

224
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Codename steak knife

225
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
He denies it

226
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
This is not as cool as you made it sound

227
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,511
No that sucks

228
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
Codenames

229
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Nice

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Cake

231
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
That's even worse I want to be upon whatever

232
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
She denies that any of this is true but is widely understood

233
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
And if his denial isn't the LIE his story is

234
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Bananas

235
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,319
There's a great piece about this by James Harkin in GQ that I'm taking a lot of the background information

236
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
People check out that that are

237
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Okay cool

238
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,047
Apparently in the late 1970s capodieci met an army Sergeant named Peter Jung

239
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
A guy who's so charismatic and his superiors quote

240
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
Allowed him to wear civilian clothes Dona beard and develop his own sources

241
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Zoe was Sergeant Bilko

242
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Somehow through the magic of Charmander

243
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,455
Who's even though Jones work for the British Army and scappaticci was in the ira

244
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
They forged a friendship that resulted in scappaticci becoming a mole

245
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,927
Wow this is a real Romeo and Juliet situation kind of

246
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,023
How do I get to bite this point the IRA to become a slightly smaller organizations

247
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Mission which was where they were spies

248
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Why is trying to infiltrate their ranks

249
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Come snitches

250
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
That sucks they put together a counterintelligence

251
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Which is meant to root out any potential spies

252
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Harkins article

253
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
By the

254
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,943
1980s capodici was the deputy head of internal security and a trusted member of its

255
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
General headquarters stats

256
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
So many goddamn times

257
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
Why are you always putting charge their own investigation

258
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,487
Essentially through unconventional methods

259
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,863
The British government had cultivated a relationship with a double agent was placed internally in a position that it was almost

260
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,679
Comically strategic

261
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
Get the f*** out of here double agent was the guy in the ira who was in charge of finding double agent

262
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,711
Unrealistic

263
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,343
So as is the case with all these artists pie related stories everything is morally questionable

264
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,951
A lot of the story revolves around scappaticci killing or allowing people to be killed

265
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
You could compromise is

266
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Position as a double agent

267
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Or people who are they needed to protect

268
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
In order to pursue goals of like arresting higher-ups

269
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,959
Figure

270
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
It's messy business and no one's hands are clean but depending on Whose version

271
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
The store you believe

272
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
This is all made up

273
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
According scappaticci was responsible for helping disruptive

274
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Multiple terrorist plots

275
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
I don't horrible cough

276
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,391
The accusation that pretty scappaticci with steak Knife came to light in 2000

277
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm 30 and it's became a big story as

278
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
As well it should be

279
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
The important piece to recognize here though is that Alex is missing the forest

280
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
For the trees

281
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
Heater prices audience of learning about this fascinating piece of History

282
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
From learning about the history of the IRA and the troubles

283
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Because the headline works

284
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Different way for him

285
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,407
This is a story about a very well-placed double agent within the IRA but

286
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Alex

287
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
This can prove the MI6

288
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Was running the IRA all along

289
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
And the bombings in the attacks were all just

290
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
False flag

291
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,487
That's an outrageous misuse of the story and by reporting it this way I was actually doing something worse than just

292
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Ignoring the story altogether

293
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
He's creating a fake version of it for Azadi

294
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Easily convinced

295
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Themselves they understand

296
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
He's like Aaron Sorkin

297
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
Even if all the allegations about scappaticci are correct

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
And accurate

299
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
He wasn't the top man in the IRA and he wasn't the one carrying out the bombing

300
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
Alex's embellishing that element of the story because it helps him construct the impression

301
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
That the world is off

302
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
And that everything you hear is a lie

303
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
It's a perversion

304
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Of skepticism and curiosity

305
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,583
It is really a good day I mean as far as storytelling goes it when you

306
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
Reduce it down into this kind of b******* you miss out on a very human story where people are making difficult to

307
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,799
Visions in moral gray areas where they're struggling

308
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Keep from being caught while at the same time

309
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Struggling to shows that they're trying

310
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
The catch themselves

311
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
A really fascinating story

312
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
MI6 already running the IRA is a really boring story actually

313
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
It's much easier

314
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
It explain explanatory power over stuff

315
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
That would be so

316
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
I can take

317
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
Years of study Edward

318
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
You could be a historian

319
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
University

320
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah with tenure

321
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
AMC

322
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Maybe not fully be able to explain it

323
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Except over the course of a semester

324
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
Well I mean it goes back again to how boring it is

325
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Said that your enemy is both

326
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,087
Everywhere running everything and it's also so incompetent that you can defeat them at any and all time

327
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,975
Of course that's a boring story I don't care if Superman can always win and I don't care

328
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
Sure I know it's boring I think

329
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
I think to like

330
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,911
What I was getting at is the like it's very unsatisfying if you are a demagogue

331
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
On the radio

332
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
To be like all right

333
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,311
Buckle down forever

334
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
It's going to require a lot of reading and research on your part

335
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,527
Instead be real became a huge it instead everybody just telling people like

336
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
It's all fake

337
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623
The big Boogeyman is running everything who cares

338
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
These globalized

339
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Cereal dude become a huge

340
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't I don't know

341
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
Nevermind

342
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Also I should tell you this

343
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
2018 Ford Escape

344
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
DG's homeless search

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
As part of an investigation into his role in the ira

346
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Resulting any murder charges

347
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,503
Although he did plead guilty to having at least 329 images of animal p*** on his computer

348
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
According to an article in the Irish Times

349
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,951
Westminster magistrates Court heard scappaticci told police he was not sexually interested in animals

350
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
But preferred women with big breasts

351
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,351
He was ordered to pay a total of 185 lb including court costs

352
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Man

353
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Okay

354
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
This is why

355
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Journalism has a huge hole

356
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
And that is

357
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Very intended

358
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,319
I now need to know what they mean by a********* I can't not know

359
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,927
Pornography featuring animals I don't know what that means

360
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
The animal kingdom is large

361
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
You know what I'm saying is I know I know exactly what you're saying I just don't share your curiosity

362
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
I love you too curiosity.

363
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,383
Okay I'm sorry if we can get those Court files for you

364
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,527
I just want to know all those tickets

365
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
I would like

366
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
I do not want to see it

367
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
I'd like to apologize that

368
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
My research did not go deeper into this

369
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
PostScript on a story

370
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
I'm just saying decency rules keep us

371
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Forgetting a full pic

372
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Picture of the story and it shall continue

373
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
Alex's used this story about the IRA double agent

374
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
In order to justify that lie

375
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Like everything is a false flag

376
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
All of the

377
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Conflict

378
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
In Northern Ireland

379
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Volkswagen

380
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Let's do it all and

381
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
Volkswagen is a British trick although

382
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
It's been picked up by other

383
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
People that Alex might love in the present day

384
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Putin

385
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Moscow

386
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
Brittany

387
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Petersburg

388
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Turned out he was

389
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
3 years of a yelton's

390
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
I got elected with a large

391
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Great

392
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
This is insane

393
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
Alex

394
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
2003 have a lot of reasons why he believes

395
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,752
Yeah we're very much in a mobbed-up

396
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
He's a front man for

397
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,896
Consortium is on the East Coast territory in terms of knowledge of crime

398
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
It's strange because

399
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
Cuz I don't think Alex is expressing like

400
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
I think he did it

401
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
No no no

402
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
These people were arrest

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Did planting the bombs

404
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
To him

405
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Definitive

406
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
And somehow that has changed

407
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Or he's just decided

408
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
I don't care if someone

409
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Swag

410
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Exiled

411
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Because

412
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
I like the way the

413
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
That there

414
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Strong Manning

415
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,104
I mean I guess I guess it's if everybody else is false

416
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,688
False flagging then you know I might as well pick the guy who's doing it

417
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,344
They were doing it in in such a way Prince of my hopeful White

418
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,184
National perhaps he does truly believe that

419
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
It's like

420
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
It's a short

421
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Jump from everything is fake

422
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,400
Do nothing matters very good boy

423
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:35,776
Everybody is false flagging everybody then

424
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,384
The ethical implications of pulling a false flag are really not that high

425
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
Yeah that's true you just what the results

426
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
Right I could see Alex ethically

427
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Being okay with Volkswagen

428
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
In order to serve

429
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Whatever interest

430
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
He's most ishua Airline

431
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
I don't know that to be the case but I could easily see that being

432
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Something that he

433
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Subconsciously

434
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,424
I would I would argue that there is zero possibility but

435
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Alex's life is over

436
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
That he himself does not trying

437
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
And carry out some sort of false

438
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
Sure they're just going to like that's the narrative Arc

439
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
For him

440
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
Season of House

441
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
Etiquette ride motorcycles

442
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,304
I am just saying that

443
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Everything is fake

444
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
World

445
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
And their price

446
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Cabal

447
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
So that doesn't sound like the devil

448
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
No no

449
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
That's one thing that's straight-up global

450
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Anna and secondarily

451
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
Alex seems to be convinced

452
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Literally everything is

453
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
It does seem there are no real terrorist

454
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
The tax there is no real

455
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
That's

456
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Dancing line

457
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
I don't know

458
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
Stand by that today but that makes

459
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah everything is

460
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Lake

461
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,720
If you're if you start from the position of everything is fake

462
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
That leaves you with way more option

463
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Chance to occasionally accept things

464
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
If you start with the position that some things are true for instance

465
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
Putin

466
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,824
Then eventually you're going to have to change your opinion whenever you change your opinion about

467
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
That's no good

468
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
That's no good

469
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Yeah and I say

470
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,504
Alex is so sneaky like

471
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Lenny says like everything is fake there's so many different versions of

472
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Fake videos

473
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,744
Okay well

474
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Because they knew about the

475
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,656
The drugging in advance they would already prepared for Eid was on

476
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
This this clip actually

477
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
You got me into it interesting headspace

478
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Power

479
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
That clip really help me put in

480
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
The context why it's

481
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
So much less

482
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
Painful to listen to Iowa to show in 2000

483
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
3 oz compared

484
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
The present day

485
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Is there's a presentation of Hope

486
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
In 2003 most people Democrats

487
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Tan Republic

488
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
Even people who work in the

489
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
Community or in the White House

490
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Are good people

491
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:19,776
It's just a couple thousand villains who are secretly orchestrating literally every terrorist attack in the world and running all government

492
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Financial system

493
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Is Ludacris

494
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
But from the standpoint of gauging emotion

495
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Channel States

496
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,968
There's a perspective of optimism that you can kind of feel in the program

497
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
Compare that to the modern-day where Alex's shows

498
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
F****** Doom

499
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
In this clip alone you have a reminder that most people are good people and

500
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
And a competent desertion that there's a

501
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
A good chance that the world can be saved

502
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
Both of these are completely foreign concept to Alec

503
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
What's today

504
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
Everyone who disagrees with him is a pedophile who works for Satan

505
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
And even if

506
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,752
The Patriots are successful the globalists are still going to kill almost every

507
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
With a super bio-weapon

508
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Whatever he feels like ranting about that day

509
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,688
Part of the reason it's his show sucks so much in 2021

510
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Is it actively depressed

511
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
Not just in the sense that it's depressing that someone would believe the nonsense

512
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,904
But the way the show is structured in the way information is

513
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Conveyed is a f****** drag

514
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
I don't believe Alex

515
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Fun facts about courage or honesty

516
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
But

517
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
I think that he might respect human life in 2003

518
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Yeah

519
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
I mean

520
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Here's what I would

521
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
Should last

522
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Stronger than Satan

523
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Cuz here's

524
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
This is what happened

525
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
Iron Man

526
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
You're just fighting Obadiah Stane

527
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,880
That's the first movie you're just fighting some other guy it's a real small self-contained story

528
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
20 years later

529
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Half of the universe

530
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,792
Has disappeared just like The Simpsons

531
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
They're still there talkin about family

532
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
And then Ten Years Later is like The Simpsons are going to

533
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
The Moon is like because you're just

534
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Can't keep going

535
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
The same level

536
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,224
Eventually you're going to have to say that everybody's going to die

537
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,088
If you start out with there's a few thousand people twenty years later everybody has to die

538
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
But it's just a yeah I think

539
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
I think that

540
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
You're right

541
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
When it's

542
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,048
I don't I don't know I don't know if it's Universal

543
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
So but narrative fiction does have that way of

544
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
I'm running into a problem of like what we told the story already what other story we can tell

545
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
Is narrative fiction oh that. I agree that that is the

546
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
The same problem that I was

547
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
What does running into how do you keep people excited

548
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
You can have other things like the MacNeil Lehrer our didn't

549
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
Do it.

550
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
I realized Carson was on the air for a while

551
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,744
There's other there's other forms of entertainment

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,584
Have the same escalatory problem

553
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
Vn2000 get out

554
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,472
So here is a nice example of the continuing threat of Alex being

555
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
Wrong in a way that he will soon learn

556
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Is wrong

557
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
Amaya reporting Bass

558
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Therapy

559
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Myra

560
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
So we've got these really consist

561
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Some things

562
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Keep coming up on

563
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
On every show

564
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,608
Like Putin bomb the apartment buildings and they're putting the bath party CIAA

565
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
I empower

566
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
I know it sounds like I'm beating a dead horse

567
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Is here but like

568
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Constant

569
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
It did not like

570
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
He saying it every other minute

571
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,664
These beings are touched

572
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
They're both

573
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Not at all

574
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Well once

575
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
Just an accurate and then the other one is something that is

576
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
Exactly the opposite of what Alex will later believe

577
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
He doesn't know it but we don't know yet

578
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
De-baathification is beginning

579
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Renault

580
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,192
So I believe I believe her another week or so off of when that conversation

581
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
I mean it

582
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,312
Clothes that I believe it's in May or roundabout

583
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Two

584
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
This is one thing that is so frustrating about Alex

585
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Is that on that day

586
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
That he does find out

587
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,064
I would like him to find out on air and I would like him to do

588
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,624
Deflate like a balloon you know somebody to pricum

589
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
And he just goes

590
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:25,280
Like that but he's not going to do that he's just going to included in some other part

591
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,888
They're doing it publicly to get rid of bath to make you forget

592
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
CIA people in there

593
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,640
This is this is this is wild I mean we're on May 12th. I just looked this up and the first

594
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Coalition provisional Authority

595
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Announcement

596
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
That

597
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
Started the process of two-bathroom Acacia

598
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Suzuki 60

599
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,880
So we're four days away

600
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
From

601
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
From this as we look at Alex's

602
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Absolutely Wild

603
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
I guess we'll know pretty soon

604
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Episode will find out

605
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
I don't know

606
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm a little bit older than you

607
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Enzo 2003 hours a adult

608
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Yeah I was not as a dignified

609
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
I remember the conversation

610
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,968
In about Freedom fries

611
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
Forget that one in Freedom tow

612
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Yep

613
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
And I knew that was

614
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Was f****** stupid

615
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
People

616
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Particularly to members

617
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Republicans in the house

618
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
I got mad about

619
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
French fries

620
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
French toast

621
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Being served in the cafeteria

622
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
Because

623
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
Of course France had not agreed to join in with the

624
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
The Invasion

625
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
The Rock and they were cowards

626
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah

627
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
It's never not going to be

628
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
Surprising that we are governed by children

629
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,296
To Alex's credit he also thinks that whole freedom

630
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Fry thing was stupid for him

631
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Mexico

632
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Old war

633
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
You know why they said no they

634
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
Cuz I didn't bother internal population

635
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
That's not

636
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
Great that's not cool I didn't even know there could be a racist reason

637
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Been for that being

638
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Stupid

639
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah it's stupid because

640
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
It doesn't mean anything

641
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
It doesn't mean anything

642
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,280
It's a Belgian waffle even if Belgium doesn't appreciate

643
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,680
It doesn't matter it's stupid on its face because chocolate empty meaningless

644
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Pointless gesture

645
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
It's not somehow because of

646
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,848
Racism how is that possible

647
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
All things

648
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,688
I think I would rather deal with

649
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Freedom fries on freedom toast

650
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
Then someone like Alex is perpetuating the idea that

651
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Did France

652
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,648
Made this geopolitical decision to not get involved

653
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
In the Iraq War at that point

654
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,280
Because they were afraid of Muslim French people

655
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Attacking

656
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
That's so deeply islamophobic

657
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
And terrifying

658
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
At the point in his career

659
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
When

660
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
He has the presentation of

661
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Not being

662
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Anti-muslim

663
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
He certainly not as

664
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Aggressively

665
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Things are there

666
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Diving in Clear Lake

667
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Definitely

668
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
That's that's the level of

669
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
Shyt where you like there's just no way you want

670
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
Take it back to racism

671
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
I'm just like you know I think

672
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
I think I need a new coffee maker

673
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,192
Well that's because of it I don't want to know why it's because of I just

674
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
Just because my other one broke

675
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
There's no other

676
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
There's no other reason

677
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,384
There's no people behind

678
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
The really old and coffee

679
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
There's no reason to be racist about this

680
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
So

681
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
I wish that I had musical ability

682
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Cuz if I did

683
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Long ago

684
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
Yeah I would have made a bumper kind of Sting

685
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Sound

686
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
For the

687
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
Alex telling a story that totally happened

688
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Sure sure

689
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Totally happened

690
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,520
Cuz we get we get them all over the place throughout his career at any point you're going to hear stories

691
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
It definitely happened

692
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Do me right before you play

693
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Right now

694
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
Alix's true story

695
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
I have

696
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Where the

697
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
Bigos

698
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Incredible

699
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
Because we know this is

700
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Steve Steve

701
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,248
Alix's true story crying

702
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
TaylorMade

703
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Bushes and conservative weekend

704
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Alex

705
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Please free us from

706
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
Soviet Union we were raised

707
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
I saw your

708
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Your eyes get a little

709
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:52,192
Confuse me was talking about his laundry and I was a little bit confused as well

710
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
Random thing to do

711
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
The time frame is really what was wearing

712
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
This didn't happen

713
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
So Alex takes a call

714
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
At this point

715
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Michelle and

716
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,672
This was that this was interesting this introduces a large theme

717
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
That will run throughout the neck

718
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Couple days

719
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
One more thing

720
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
Israel today that they're going to be doing about

721
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
15 minutes

722
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Are you disposed

723
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,152
Take place for 5 days and raised the alert level

724
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
I'm told

725
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
The martial law

726
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
I will

727
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,728
This is a bad answer on Alex's bar but I kind of see what

728
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
Alex Methodist drill was apart of

729
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Preparing the public

730
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Look for martial law

731
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
What the color was asking was whether another drill would continue pass

732
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Day 5 and 6

733
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Sunday 7 and so on

734
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
What the drill be how Marshall all literally started

735
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
That was a question that was being a

736
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,464
Essentially telling this guy this drill was the beginning of enslavement

737
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
She's really bad

738
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
It's hard for me to imagine that Alex misunderstood the question

739
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,096
Except in the case that he wasn't listen

740
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
A Tallwood Drive

741
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Totally possible

742
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
So I found the after-action report

743
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
For this drill by released by The Washing

744
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Engine State Department of Health

745
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
This girl was called top off to

746
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,200
And it was meant to simulate a wmd attack simultaneously hitting multiple cities

747
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
It began with a bioterrorist attack in

748
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
In Chicago

749
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
And a dirty bomb going off in

750
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
In Seattle

751
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
In addition

752
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
These challenges quote

753
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
A cyber event

754
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
Affecting the state's communication infrastructure hit the week

755
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Before

756
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,560
The further complicate the situation a hostile takeover of the washing

757
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Hampton State ferry

758
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
And a hostage event

759
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Did Pierce County south of Seattle where included

760
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
That probably seems like Overkill

761
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
But that's the

762
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
As the report

763
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Explicitly says quote

764
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
In all the event was meant to overwhelm local state and federal agencies with a goal of finding ways to improve preparedness response

765
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
What's a recovery capabilities

766
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
The goal was to create a fix

767
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Situation that was too much to handle

768
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,392
You can stress test in a fake situation

769
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Instead of a real one

770
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,256
This buckets not done we're going to fill it full of water to find out where the f****** holes

771
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
This simulation taught the washing

772
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Department of Health a bunch

773
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Important

774
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,472
For instance they learned that their radiological monitoring and Assessment Center had no

775
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Reason to be on site

776
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Sunset quote

777
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Became mired in the response organization

778
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Which limited its ability to fully perform its work

779
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
An off-site areas

780
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,296
That's a pretty important lesson but probably less critical them learning that the infrastructure they hadn't placed a

781
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,880
Was insufficient to handle the needs they

782
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Faced an

783
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,720
Maps and data tables that were critical to

784
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Decision maker

785
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,584
We're not effectively transmitted given their existing set up which is a huge issue

786
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
That they were able to identify from this

787
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Turns out

788
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Turns out using the pony

789
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,080
Express is not going to do it ladies and gentlemen I apologize because up

790
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
Another thing that's important to understand is that this is just

791
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
The after-action report for the washer

792
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Penn State Department of Health

793
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,808
They didn't run the simulation they were just one of the groups

794
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Participating in it

795
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,184
Each entity that took play part they played different roles

796
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,232
Dissimulation in a face different challenges

797
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Each came away with their own lesson

798
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Their own gaps and planning

799
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
That they could resolve

800
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,960
I found the after-action summary for the entire exercise when the Department of Homeland

801
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
Security and the Washington Department of Health is just one

802
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,848
47 state or local agencies that took part in the drill

803
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
Along with 41 federal agencies

804
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,504
A21 agencies from Canada that got involved because that biotech it hit Chicago

805
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Dammit Canada

806
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,416
I was reading over the summary and there's an amazing piece on page

807
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,536
8 where the exercise ended up teaching everyone who participated about the actual definition

808
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Literally Stafford Act

809
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
Which covers have federal assistance

810
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Floyd

811
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
It's an emergency

812
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
I know we were supposed to read it before it clarified

813
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:18,688
Definition cuz they hadn't roll places things

814
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
A terrorist bio attack

815
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,576
Quotes does not clearly fit the existing definition of a disaster by the app

816
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,184
This made it to the president couldn't issue a declaration of a disaster in the drill.

817
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
Instead the Secretary of HHS could only declare a pub

818
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Public Health

819
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
They didn't

820
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Realize this

821
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Forecast

822
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
From the report quote

823
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
These two declaration

824
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,496
Illustrated some of the subtleties of the Stafford act that may not have been

825
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Been fully appreciated before the X

826
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
Sure there's eight

827
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,224
Hannah value in art organizations preparing like this using fake disasters to learn how to respond better to real

828
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552
This exercise was followed by top off three witches

829
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Took place in two

830
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
5 in expanded to

831
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,696
Fully include exercises being run by the Canadian and UK government

832
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
In

833
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
And collaboration

834
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,048
In that scenario they came up with 50

835
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Team scary terrorist ideas

836
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Isn't chose 32 simulator

837
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
There was a terrorist release of anime

838
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Plague in New Jersey

839
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
A mustard-gas IED attack

840
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Connecticut

841
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
And then the events in the UK and Canada which this report.

842
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
Specify

843
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,480
And it really pissed me off because I want to know what games are there

844
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
This was followed by top-off for in 2010

845
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,416
And as of yet this series of scenario planning exercises has not resulted in martial law

846
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:38,304
You would think that if Alex's whole thing about other Global at Susie's exercise to launch their evil plans or something had any Merit

847
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,912
One of these would have resulted in something more nefarious than government employees learning

848
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Fingers

849
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Yeah

850
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
And honestly

851
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
I love

852
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Reading these reports

853
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
It's because it's like

854
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,479
This would be my best day at work if I work if I worked

855
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Areas like it would be so much

856
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,647
Totally it's today it's cool

857
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
It's my favorite day in school

858
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
There was this thing called

859
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:13,119
Casa in Missouri in Columbia is the Columbia aeronautics

860
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Association

861
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
And so what they would do is they would have stood

862
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
,

863
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,871
And we would simulate running spacecraft one of the stations

864
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Was

865
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
I'm at my memories of this are a little bit spotty

866
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
But one of the station's was made to look like

867
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
The actual shuttle

868
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,623
And so you're in there and it has no responsibility

869
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Another one was

870
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,951
Command

871
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Kobayashi Maru

872
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Sure

873
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,863
Remember that being if that's a day that sticks out

874
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
To me and my head from

875
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Like my entire

876
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Elementary School career

877
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,335
Because of just the excitement of going in like role-playing this scenario of like

878
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
Trying to make sure that we

879
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
We're able to communicate

880
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455
Between the email obviously there was

881
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Some curve balls

882
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:09,439
What fun we had a we had a small like 6 ft tall in

883
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Inflatable Planetarium

884
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
You could see the stars

885
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
Not quite as fun

886
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
No

887
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Noah

888
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,495
So I don't know I I got I got really into

889
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Furious that

890
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
The Canadian in

891
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,127
UK scenarios

892
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
Pretty document

893
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
I want to know what they were facing

894
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,551
I kind of want to see if we can orchestrate like a

895
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:40,415
Giant National role-playing game where we just play the exact same thing but where

896
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,719
People inside of the simulation

897
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
And we have to act

898
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Like we're all dying

899
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
One thing that I found

900
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
But I actually kind of took a little bit of a shoe

901
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,215
Was Victor prior to this there was an exercise the original top

902
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
That one was unannounced

903
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
And so people didn't know it was happening

904
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
And I would say learn a lot of lust

905
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,343
It's from top off over the years other ones were announced ahead of time I don't know why they would do it on an hour

906
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Like I mean everyone it was

907
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
Participating new

908
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
Yeah but I mean that happened with the f****** United States Army in Russia during the Cold War there like

909
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,887
Stimulate bombing Russian let's not tell Russia about it

910
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
Dumb people

911
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
It seems like

912
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Not a wise

913
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
It seems like a possibility for

914
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,711
Alex gets another caller in this guy brings up a question about 9/11

915
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
And

916
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
I found this to be trouble

917
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Holy Rollers

918
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Commit suicide

919
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:16,159
This is a great indicator of how seriously Alex take the research into what's supposed to be his primary field of study

920
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
911

921
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
It's a regular talking point in 9/11

922
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
Conspiracy communities that somebody accused hijackers have been

923
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
And found alive

924
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,119
But anyone who looked into this of any depth

925
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
At all could tell you that this is a simple case of me

926
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Mistaken identity

927
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,263
And the investigative process being judged in the middle eyes

928
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
As opposed to edits

929
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Conclusion

930
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:39,455
One of the men listed as a suspected hijacker was Willie doll Shakira

931
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
Released a photo

932
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Made a pretty big effort

933
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Distressed

934
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
They have the wrong guy

935
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,695
He is a pilot in Saudi Arabia and had done flight training at the same school in Daytona Beach or the other

936
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
9/11 hijackers had

937
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,047
But he was definitely alive Georgia Morocco

938
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,839
Hi I did not fly that plane

939
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
On account of I am here

940
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
So what

941
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
This is a simple case of mistaken identity

942
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,567
One of the flight 11 hijackers was named will leave Muhammad Al Shakira

943
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
As the man who was alive

944
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Protected is innocent

945
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,711
The BBC made an error in their initial coverage reporting

946
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,783
But a man listed as one of the hijackers was actually alive

947
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Which route

948
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
Technically accurate gave a different impression from what was actually

949
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
We going on

950
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:23,231
If you just live and die by headlines and never look any deeper in

951
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,583
Two things you could easily think that the person the FBI claimed was on flight 11 was actually alive

952
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
But you'd be wrong

953
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,423
This is super easy thread to untangle if you

954
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Want to know what happened

955
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
It certainly all of this information is fully available

956
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
2003

957
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
There's a couple other people

958
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,663
People who are named as hijackers who initial reports claimed were alive

959
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Actually we're alive

960
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,759
Like Abdul Aziz Al Omari

961
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
Hame Salim alfazema

962
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,831
These two men

963
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
I have something very specific in,

964
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
Which is that at some point in the not-too-distant past

965
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
They had their passports stolen

966
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,047
How has me buy a pickpocket in Cairo

967
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,863
And alomari in a burglary when he was living in Denver

968
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:06,751
Sure is Alex's of supposed anomalies like those are actually instances

969
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,079
Miscommunicated information that he never followed

970
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
Alex

971
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
Reporters worker Spiegel

972
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
We did look into somebody's coincidences to see what happen

973
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
He reached out to John Bradley

974
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,879
Levi managing editor of Arab News where much of the initial reporting originate

975
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
You told them quote

976
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,975
All of this is attributable to the chaos that prevailed during the

977
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
If your first two days following the attack

978
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
What we're dealing with are coincidentally identical

979
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
He also made it clear these articles were being written

980
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,007
After September 14th released a list of names

981
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,287
Disaffected hijacker

982
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,383
There's one area where Alex really needs to be sure he's covering

983
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
Basis it should be 911

984
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Conspiracies

985
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,039
You can see here how sloppy is work is even on this trademarks subject

986
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,111
Even in 2003 even about 9/11

987
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Can't go deeper than

988
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Yeah

989
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Yeah that

990
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
I can't imagine the

991
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,559
Terrible day you would have

992
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
If your passport had been

993
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
Stolen

994
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
And then you woke up the neck

995
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Text Dale

996
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
And it was

997
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Is flying into a

998
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Good beats

999
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
A real bummer of a day for you

1000
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
Men

1001
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Yeah and so there's this

1002
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,343
There's like a combination of a number of different reasons for these mistaken identities there's like identity

1003
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:31,487
Or at least very strongly suspected identity theft

1004
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
Other

1005
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
Memphis misreported

1006
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:39,423
Similar names with the same name as a lot of people in the world some of them have the same name

1007
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Right

1008
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,799
. of time between when the FBI release names and when they release

1009
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
These photos

1010
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
There was a great deal of can

1011
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,383
Confusion and soda

1012
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
The fog of

1013
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Of course

1014
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,735
Unclarity as we see after every grape

1015
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Disaster

1016
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,879
Yeah this one does not go well

1017
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
At all

1018
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
I'm sorry

1019
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
Are you wearing

1020
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Of course I am

1021
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
Has a

1022
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
Recordings from the way back

1023
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
But he has one thing about

1024
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
Ubi

1025
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
About

1026
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
About

1027
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,911
Even before the send it to the trash that it is now like

1028
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,751
You would have 2090 spent all this time yelling about going back to man

1029
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,127
Quickly became the gossip

1030
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,199
A lot of people really like to listen to the gas station

1031
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,295
He was looking more for that has call her and made Alex introspect

1032
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
And

1033
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
Besides

1034
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Well

1035
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,951
The name William Cooper has been revoked on my show

1036
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
I better lie about

1037
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Okay

1038
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
William

1039
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Anybody

1040
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,463
Here is the ears the issue Alex's totally write that Bill Cooper was in

1041
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
Incredibly unstable

1042
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
And I wasn't

1043
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,119
He's lying about the appearance on the show that we didn't

1044
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
An entire episode about how long William Cooper had been

1045
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,519
Unstable for probably a bit longer

1046
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,335
The last few years of his life fool boy is a lot longer

1047
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
It's not I think you did get much worse than Advil

1048
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,039
Yeah we we didn't episode The Covered Bill Cooper's appearance on Alex's show and

1049
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
It does not match up at all with the way that I'll Express

1050
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Nope

1051
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
100

1052
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:17,119
Pretty rich for a guy to criticize somebody getting into aliens later on in life and

1053
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Then later on in life

1054
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,215
Telling me the interdimensional beings are controlling

1055
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,287
The global

1056
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,319
No no

1057
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,047
Oh no

1058
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,527
I don't talk about psychic

1059
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
You know

1060
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
The universe was revealed

1061
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,351
My prediction of 911

1062
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:25,727
I have dreams that are prosthetic in the middle of nowhere

1063
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
What a dick

1064
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,871
What an assault call in this prison of prison labor

1065
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Sure

1066
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
This is this is

1067
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Bizarre

1068
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
Alex's opposition's prison

1069
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:44,671
In labor might not come from the same place that you were yours or Mine by slave labor

1070
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
And I somehow feel like Alex Wood

1071
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Disagree with me on

1072
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
I think he agrees

1073
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
But the reason why

1074
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,655
Is what where we get into a little bit of

1075
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
I saw him

1076
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
Mark schauder

1077
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
Thursday a week ago

1078
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Concerning

1079
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
Prison Industries

1080
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Putting our small

1081
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
They're working

1082
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,471
For our military

1083
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
I think

1084
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,431
The opposition to prison labor

1085
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Be

1086
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
Putting other people how to bathe

1087
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,855
Yeah I would say that Alex is now a union man about 1845

1088
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
Saying that slavery is great

1089
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
But you're competing with our wages

1090
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
It doesn't fly that this

1091
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,839
Kind of thing would be okay

1092
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Worried not

1093
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
To jeopardize the

1094
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Success of other business

1095
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:07,103
Yeah and I think I don't agree with that the way to put it on an equal playing field

1096
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
Is if they're competing with your business where you pay the people say $9 an hour

1097
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
I would

1098
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
You should do

1099
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:20,927
Is convert them into slaves for you and then everybody's on an equal playing field that's Alex

1100
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
Dissolution

1101
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:27,583
I'm not sure if that is his solution think that's what he said but I find I find this to be a nun

1102
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Thought through

1103
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Position

1104
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,519
At least a psychopathic self-involved and beneficial solution

1105
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,335
It is if that is where his opposition to prison

1106
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
Labor

1107
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,199
A system that is in place if that is where it derives from

1108
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
It's shallow

1109
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
Yes it is

1110
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
It has nothing to do with

1111
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
The ACT

1112
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,927
Making people in prison

1113
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
For very low wages

1114
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,047
Just not an industries that compete with American Business

1115
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
I don't like this

1116
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,983
She might like that anyways this caller is heard about a bill

1117
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
Maybe possibly

1118
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,055
Doesn't run with the belt but it did something

1119
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,103
And maybe

1120
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,431
Well I just I wanted to give you the

1121
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
The number of

1122
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,271
HR 1829

1123
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
Did you know to tell you the truth I was waived

1124
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
I didn't

1125
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,887
At Mark Tauscher and now

1126
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
They were trying to reach

1127
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
Affected in some way

1128
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:44,639
Admitted against it

1129
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
They said

1130
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
At their or ready to go

1131
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
The government

1132
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
Building new

1133
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
New buildings

1134
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
Expansion of the plan

1135
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Bright

1136
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
So that color had sort of heard something about a bill but didn't know what it did or really anything about it

1137
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Someone

1138
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,519
She'd heard talk about it kind of was

1139
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
Maybe into it or maybe

1140
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,615
I don't know what was going on there I appreciate

1141
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,407
Is anybody calling into a political

1142
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,807
We'll talk show describing their political views very similarly to my grandma

1143
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:29,439
Drive the movie that you just saw a couple of days ago in it

1144
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
Opposite of informal

1145
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Maybe

1146
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,679
So HR 1829 in the 108th Congress was also known as the

1147
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
Federal prison Industries competition in

1148
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Contracting Act

1149
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
After 2003

1150
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Here's what that was

1151
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
There's a government-owned corporation

1152
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
Tim called federal prison in Des

1153
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,735
Which is used to produce Goods using the labor of incarcerated persons

1154
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,063
I'll redo here from the sea go cost

1155
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Assessment of implement

1156
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Misspell

1157
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
Under current law federal agencies are required to purchase products from fpi if products are available to meet the

1158
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
Agencies

1159
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Amazon

1160
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
I would not exceed current market

1161
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Prices

1162
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,215
Such products include office furniture textiles vehicle tags and fiber up

1163
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,799
Under the proposed legislation this requirement would be reduced

1164
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
Over the next several years

1165
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,431
Have you shared the federal Market that fpi holds for the products and services

1166
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,503
They provide to be limited to 20% and 5%

1167
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Respectively

1168
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,879
If you understand that text properly what this bill would have done is actively reduced

1169
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
The government uses

1170
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
The products created with prison labor

1171
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,999
The bill aims to divert some of this product

1172
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,535
Capacity towards making good

1173
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
That would be donated to nonprofit organizations

1174
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
Instead of being sold

1175
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
The government which honestly still suck

1176
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
Additionally there were provisions

1177
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,263
Thanks for funding of vocational training for incarcerated persons

1178
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,799
And funding for programs

1179
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
To test rehabilitative activities

1180
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
They could be

1181
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Dip towards

1182
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Helping

1183
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,223
This color is no idea what this bill is in

1184
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,015
She's telling Alex about it as if it's something that

1185
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Expensive

1186
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
Open system when in actuality

1187
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,391
It was designed to limit the prophets that are Drive

1188
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
From prison labor

1189
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,231
And fold a fair amount of money towards efforts to help

1190
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
People improve their lives

1191
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
While incarcerated

1192
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
In the house it's

1193
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,887
Wheatley bizarre to see how split

1194
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
The vote on this was and not on party lines

1195
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,495
It got yay votes from

1196
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,263
Steve King

1197
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
Nancy Pelosi and Mike

1198
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Mike Pence

1199
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
What they all love slave

1200
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
Got me votes

1201
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
From Maxine Waters

1202
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,527
And Walter no french fries in my cafeteria Jones

1203
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
Okay one of the guys who did the freedom fries

1204
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,647
I am really struggling with the eye

1205
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
DIA

1206
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,439
Text somebody

1207
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Rode into a

1208
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,743
Bill

1209
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
Look before we've used

1210
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,631
100% slave labor

1211
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
For our stuff

1212
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
But now

1213
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
We want our slaves

1214
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
To make things

1215
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,359
To give to nonprofit organizations

1216
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,919
Not 100% but I get what you're saying

1217
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,807
Can you write that down and think of that as a

1218
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Not

1219
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,879
Airparrot find psychopathy

1220
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
That's why

1221
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
What do you think Ron Paul voted

1222
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,583
I'm going to go with Ron Paul voted

1223
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,399
This would have restricted the amount that

1224
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
The government could have bought from

1225
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Their slaves

1226
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Right yeah

1227
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,567
So I'm going to go with Ron voted for it

1228
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
Because he abstained promoters

1229
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,991
Read cousin screwed with his brain

1230
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,527
But he also wants

1231
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,575
Private businesses

1232
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,159
In the in the time of like polarisation

1233
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,999
Now in the present-day it is really weird to look at this in like

1234
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Received it being pretty

1235
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,655
Mixed in jazz of party at each side

1236
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:56,799
The bill ended up passing the house 352 65 but it died immediately upon being received by the senate in

1237
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
So

1238
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
Government

1239
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,967
Way to do your jobs yeah

1240
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,343
So Alex ends up talking to this guy named Colonel Craig Roberts

1241
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
The same person is Paul Walker

1242
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Craig Roberts

1243
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Is a weirdo

1244
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Guy who wrote

1245
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
This dude is super

1246
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,351
Conspiracies like JFK

1247
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,423
Love's Oklahoma City

1248
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Gotta love the baby

1249
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
The Finders

1250
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,263
They're talking about likes

1251
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
Some child ring

1252
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,335
And stuff back in

1253
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:35,199
2003

1254
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,807
Good he doesn't bring up Epstein so that's that's interesting so we didn't know about Epic

1255
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
He might've

1256
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
It's not proof that he does

1257
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,671
It's not something that comes up

1258
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,951
Immediately

1259
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Although Alex does save

1260
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
In their interview

1261
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Come on

1262
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,407
Your father

1263
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
We know who that is

1264
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
God dammit

1265
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,063
Infuriating

1266
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,623
Still could be a metaphor

1267
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
It's very unsatisfied

1268
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
That's dark

1269
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,511
How dare he say that

1270
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,047
Tippy-toeing around it

1271
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Dip your balls into Jesus

1272
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
That's okay

1273
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,679
Let's go for it talk about Jesus from time to time

1274
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,983
I'm less interested in him being religious

1275
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
Which does exist

1276
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
His extremist

1277
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,359
Andover

1278
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
But

1279
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
The present

1280
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
But he

1281
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
I'm I'm

1282
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
I'm not interested in that

1283
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
I'm interested in specifically

1284
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
The

1285
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:50,207
Literalness is Waging War against the devil

1286
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
Where everything we're doing is

1287
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Is a fight against the literal Christ

1288
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
Devil

1289
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,143
Jodi Craig Robertson Alex

1290
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,983
Have a conversation

1291
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Kind of like

1292
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
Kind of conspiracy Shore topics

1293
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
I am and it's

1294
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
It's

1295
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:14,527
Basis that we've had before interested in a lot of that minutiae

1296
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,575
Because of stuff like that

1297
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Once they they put laws

1298
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
You know that

1299
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
These dudes are being

1300
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Super dishonor

1301
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
About the subject recovering here

1302
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
For one thing this episode is in 2000

1303
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,639
Free over a year before the federal assault weapons

1304
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
Openspan is set to hit at sunset.

1305
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,783
Alex is saying that the band sunset provision had just been ignored which is a lie

1306
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:51,391
And even if he was just saying that they were going to ignore the sunset provision in the future

1307
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
You be wrong

1308
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:58,047
The Patriot Act was not subject to a complete Sunset Clause but various sections of the bill were

1309
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,887
However the Sunset date for that bill was December 31st 2000

1310
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
5 more

1311
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
The two years in the future from the point that Alex's speaker

1312
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Can gear

1313
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,287
In terms of this one it's a little bit more of a complicated

1314
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
Picture I'm not in favor of the Patriot Act

1315
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,175
But I don't think that attacking it from the standpoint of sunset Clause is

1316
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Is particularly affect

1317
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Reproach

1318
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,855
Durban multiple bills over the years that we examined and reauthorized various provisions and amended some of them as well

1319
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Is a common aspect

1320
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
The bills that have Santa Claus's

1321
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,719
No it's not like they have a self-destruct

1322
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Claws

1323
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
The idea is to set a date

1324
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,607
In the future to reassess whether or not the particular bill is worth continuing

1325
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,983
You can take you see with the decision to reauthorize the Patriot Act by pretending it reauthorizing it is somehow

1326
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Cheating

1327
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,775
Is a silly argument

1328
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Yeah that doesn't make a

1329
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,871
Both of these examples that Alex uses to make

1330
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
His point that the bills

1331
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,223
Never go away

1332
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,783
Their bills that haven't reached their Sunset date

1333
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
Is it making this s*** up

1334
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
Now the case of the Brady Bill is actually a little bit more into

1335
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
The bill was first introduced in 1987 in Wisconsin

1336
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,023
Set lien on starter

1337
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
The Reagan Administration

1338
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,351
A all that interested in it

1339
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,167
Progress at a lot of trouble with getting it to a floor vote

1340
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,215
10 to attempt to attach it

1341
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
The larger crime bill

1342
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
Which ended up being a losing strategy

1343
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,895
All this changed when Bill Clinton was elected in 1992

1344
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,943
And voiced support for the Brady Bill

1345
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,735
And indicated that he was willing

1346
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
Design it if it was Pat

1347
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,855
Please change the landscape and Bill made its way through concur

1348
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,487
Part of the negotiation to get the bill through Congress had to do with the mandatory waiting. The bill pudding

1349
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
Place for gun purchase

1350
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,863
With the technology available the time it could take awhile to run a background check

1351
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
Jacksonville 5-day. Was included in the bill

1352
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,983
However gun proponents wanted to strike a deal

1353
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
Their long-standing argument was that provision

1354
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Should exist

1355
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,919
That is waiting. We made Nolan void once the technology existed for an

1356
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Instant check

1357
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
System

1358
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,807
This made some sense given that the waiting. Is largely predicated on the tech

1359
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Logical inability to do that

1360
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
Check quicker

1361
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Instead of this compromise What was decided was at the waiting. Provision the bill would have a sunset Clause that would kick in in 5 years

1362
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
Whether or not there was an a

1363
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Check system

1364
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,959
Dissatisfied both sides of the bill passed the House and Senate in November 1993

1365
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
The Brady Bill

1366
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
Itself didn't have a sunset clause

1367
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
This provision of it

1368
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
The larger bill was permanent

1369
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
And putting plates requirement

1370
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,967
For background checks for gun sales made by federally

1371
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Stone cellar

1372
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:29,599
In 1998 the mics system was developed in that kind of made this whole question

1373
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Kamut

1374
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,463
The sunset Clause came and went and now there is no federal waiting. Required for

1375
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Sing a gun

1376
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:40,095
Each state has the right to make their own rules on that and according to a recent article from ABC News

1377
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,679
10 states and the District of Columbia have waiting periods where it's most

1378
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,263
Alex and Craig Roberts are covering the subject from

1379
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
Completely dishonest person

1380
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,847
How to just making stuff up

1381
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,919
Craig is pretending that the entire Brady Bill was set to Sunset

1382
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,455
What in fact it was just this

1383
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
Provision which did in fact go away

1384
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,343
I understand that their staunch opponent of any kind of gun regulation

1385
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,415
Recovering the material this in accurately feels like it's

1386
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
It's a disservice

1387
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,231
Do sincere people who care about gun rights

1388
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
And it leads me not to take

1389
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,863
Stop they're saying all that seriously about any other issues

1390
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
That's

1391
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
That's very

1392
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
I don't like it

1393
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,519
I like it also I don't like that though waiting. Expired

1394
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
Oh my God stupid

1395
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,615
At the very least at the very least

1396
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Here's what we should have

1397
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,199
No bad days waiting.

1398
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,015
You can't have a bad day and then go buy a

1399
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,343
You got to wait at least until your bad day is over

1400
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
You know I'm saying like I do I

1401
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
Understand that position

1402
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
And I think of it

1403
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
States

1404
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
That decides

1405
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:45,887
To pass those things are well within their rights of not having a federal mandated waiting

1406
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,935
. doesn't seem that weird to

1407
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:52,543
As long as the background check system is it does work

1408
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Effective

1409
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Not positive

1410
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,895
It's fully operational

1411
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,175
And does

1412
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Does a perfect job

1413
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,527
Yeah I know I can I can see both sides of it

1414
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
On a state level at

1415
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Static

1416
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,463
It's fine for that to be where that little more sure I see that

1417
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,791
Colton do breakfast of champions law

1418
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:18,143
You can't have a sudden outbreak of a syphilitic breakdown

1419
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
And buy a gun on the same

1420
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
I think that's fine

1421
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,799
Yeah it'll in a perfect world I would be all right with

1422
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,335
Okay good we have come

1423
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Optimizer

1424
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,687
It's time for you to play the theme song

1425
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
M4r

1426
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Our new Sigma

1427
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:32,991
Alright

1428
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
Alix's true story

1429
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
And I don't know

1430
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,463
I don't believe Alex's

1431
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,535
Version of the story or that it happen

1432
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
But

1433
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
Even if you take Alex at his word

1434
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,655
M2003

1435
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,983
You'd only been threatened watch

1436
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,359
I just don't I just don't like that I know for a fact that they've been doing

1437
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:37,759
TV interviews with voice modulators and everything

1438
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
Alex

1439
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:47,231
Only the government has that capability. No one else has a voice box

1440
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,375
There was a f****** vocoder really high-tech stuff

1441
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
Alright

1442
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
Only the Fed

1443
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Have that

1444
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,007
So he's talkin Oz

1445
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Craig Roberts

1446
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
And

1447
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
This this this clip

1448
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Really

1449
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,407
Really was a big problem

1450
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,815
Underground movement

1451
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,775
Oh yeah here's the first real in

1452
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
Indication that I've seen that maybe Alex

1453
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:38,175
What does think he's up against the literal devil at this early stage in his career

1454
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
It's still not nearly as overt as he is now but it

1455
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Kitten clothes

1456
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Being disturbed

1457
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,927
Bijou that I run into is the baseball announcer saying he could very well thanks

1458
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,487
He's fighting the minions of

1459
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
The literal Christian devil

1460
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
He could just think

1461
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
50-state mr. idiot

1462
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
It's doing dark pointless rituals to a nonexistent deity

1463
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,727
So I regret to inform you that this is not conclusive enough for me to call this

1464
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,751
This case closed

1465
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:07,359
If I was interested in the idea that Chandra Levy Viet was involved in a satanic

1466
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Sex quotes

1467
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
This was news to me so I decided

1468
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
The Poke around

1469
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
And see what Alex is talking about

1470
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
This was not a story

1471
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,855
The broken the mainstream news and the reason people stop talking

1472
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,439
Much about Levy and Gary Condit was cuz 9/11 happen

1473
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:26,559
It wasn't like a medium was worried that people would learn of a secret satanic sex cult so they bury the story

1474
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
9/11 happen

1475
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,911
I was well I mean that was

1476
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Look

1477
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
That happened in the morning

1478
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,263
Otherwise it was a slow news day

1479
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,871
I'd I would imagine that not a lot of rank

1480
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
After

1481
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Yeah I could see that

1482
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:47,807
Confusing

1483
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,831
On the website

1484
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,111
A guy named techsmartt

1485
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,671
This is upsetting for a number of reasons

1486
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,231
Did one of them actually dovetails with this stupid

1487
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
Conspiracy that I was Raising gear

1488
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
This episode

1489
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,351
Text Mars died in 2019

1490
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
Credibly prolific

1491
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,935
A conspiracy theorist

1492
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
An extremist

1493
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,775
Speaker

1494
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
Perhaps one of the most

1495
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,591
Distinctive traits

1496
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,615
Of his though

1497
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Is a very clear

1498
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
Very deep

1499
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
And very consistent Auntie summer

1500
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
Text still has a website running

1501
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
And if you go there

1502
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,855
You can purchase audio tapes

1503
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
Or maybe they're preaching I don't know

1504
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,511
Let me to read some of the titles

1505
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
Oh no you can buy

1506
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:34,143
But I'm not going to give this a****** or his estate

1507
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,935
Who killed Jesus

1508
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:42,079
How cowardly lukewarm Christians are abandoning the truth and ripping passages out of the Bible in a futile attempt to appease the

1509
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,407
The Jews was that a sequel to who framed Rodger rabbit

1510
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Nope

1511
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,783
Jewish Master race

1512
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,343
I think that sounds weirdly positive Ana

1513
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,159
Here's a little snippet of the description of that want Hellcat

1514
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:02,559
Quote First the Romans asserted their superiority then came the Nazis and their exalted Aryan race

1515
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Now now it's

1516
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:10,495
The Jews who claimed to be the master race exposes those would be Gods on Earth for what they are

1517
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:15,103
Arrogant power grubbing people opposing God's truth

1518
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
One click

1519
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,455
Another one

1520
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,319
Quote Obama tells Jews no more the president finally stands up to the world

1521
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
Tormentors

1522
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
What a weird

1523
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,927
Staying to support Obama

1524
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,559
This one was apparently about Rahm Emanuel even Meeting Street

1525
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
One of them is called

1526
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
Famous anti-semites admire

1527
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,567
Interesting Lee Ron Paul

1528
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,455
That ship BuzzFeed f*** you

1529
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,759
Is that one guy called quote

1530
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,367
Chimeras monsters pizzagate and the satanic Hoodwink of America in the world

1531
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
That's that sounds like a

1532
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
Pretty regular TED Talk

1533
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,975
To be honest description includes quote

1534
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,583
Jewish scientists are working on DNA that will be inserted into the mind of every person at Birth

1535
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,935
Anti-Semitism forever in creating new races that will love Jews

1536
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,519
That's almost a legitimate possible solution

1537
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
For Jews I think they should try that one

1538
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,383
One more is called quote should Christians burn the Jewish talmud

1539
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
No

1540
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,503
Now I don't want to order listen to this one but I'm guessing the answer text comes to his

1541
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,319
Description end

1542
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:35,231
If text Mars where did the Claret International burn the town mood day would you be there to help him toss these trashy devil volumes

1543
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
To the bonfire

1544
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:45,983
Also I should do the people burning holy books think they're the good guys

1545
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:50,079
Text point out that his website also sell the bunch

1546
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,127
Books about how the Holocaust didn't happen

1547
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,455
Including one by a guy named Brian a Lewis Cheryl

1548
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:01,087
That middle name probably a coincidence right probably

1549
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,623
Things to do with it

1550
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,159
Mars is a giant

1551
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
Pile of s*** in one of the things those cost

1552
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,535
Theme of his is the Judaism is synonymous

1553
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
With satanism

1554
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,375
It's something that constantly comes up in his lecture title

1555
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
What is just called

1556
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,823
Inventors of evil things how the Jews created Freemasonry illuminism communism Satanism witchcraft

1557
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,639
Have a New Age movement and what they're up to now

1558
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,943
The description of that tape includes this

1559
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,991
Quote Jesus said of the Jews

1560
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,807
You are the out your father the devil and he spoke

1561
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
Absolute truth

1562
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
Historical record is clear

1563
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
Wow good work Bible

1564
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
The earlier when Alex

1565
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Excused

1566
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,047
You know you are out of your father

1567
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
Little bit of

1568
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,887
Making some crumbling parallels

1569
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,935
Nothing to do with that or someone like text

1570
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,263
Tomorrow is all roads lead back to Jewish people being behind the

1571
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Conspiracies that he promote

1572
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
His brand is Auntie Summit

1573
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:58,943
It's just impossible to engage with his material and not understand that so if Alex

1574
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Taking this

1575
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,783
Chandra Levy being involved in satanic

1576
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Sex cults

1577
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,903
Seriously

1578
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
That's an indication of

1579
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
Very serious

1580
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,767
Towards a content on Alex

1581
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,791
Cuz part

1582
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
.

1583
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:21,215
Text Road at least two columns about Chandra Levy's disappearance and murder and thankfully these are not behind a paywall so I can read

1584
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,031
They're f****** ridiculous

1585
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,103
Okay what attempts to make the argument that Levy was

1586
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
A secret Mossad

1587
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,919
Okay

1588
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,967
An accumulation of evidence indicates that

1589
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,551
The 24-year old Levy was a youthful recruit in the Israeli Mossad

1590
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
That nation's Premier spy age

1591
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,159
In that capacity she had served as an intern as the

1592
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,975
Executive offices of California governor Gray Davis

1593
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
An Illuminati initiate

1594
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
Where maybe where she first met mister

1595
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,119
Seconded also a little and Illuminati server

1596
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,423
Falls just short of being

1597
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Is that a no

1598
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,983
Accumulation of evidence

1599
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Sore just like

1600
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Yeah okay

1601
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Text Babe

1602
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:03,455
Are literally no evidence other than his imagination decides that as a Mossad agent

1603
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,479
Gary condit's life

1604
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,783
Baby used him to get herself access to

1605
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Did the CIA headquarters

1606
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,927
Bear she learned of The Illuminati's plan to use fake Islamic Islamic terrorists

1607
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,951
To do 9/11

1608
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,743
And that she had to be killed so she could

1609
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Don't Spill the Beans

1610
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
Wow she's good

1611
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Text Butch

1612
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Bestway

1613
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,655
As horrifying as a question maybe one must now come to

1614
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:27,519
Complete the mind-numbing possibility that Chandra Levy very well may have been

1615
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,079
Do a Darkly vicious satanic Force

1616
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
My response

1617
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
This is must one

1618
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:39,551
I don't think one must contemplate a possibility

1619
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
42 text

1620
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,647
These Darkly vicious satanic forces are they work of quote

1621
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,671
DCs

1622
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,463
Exclusive satanic Brotherhood

1623
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,791
Do what you claimed literally all members of Congress have

1624
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,351
Be apart not that exclusive

1625
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:58,239
When text Mars is discussing these satanic forces you have to be a Monumental idiot to not understand he's demonizing

1626
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
Some Jewish people

1627
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,799
It's really f****** obvious

1628
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,335
If you know anything about his

1629
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,895
You can just check out his lecture titled

1630
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,223
Quote the Jews are preparing a grave for America

1631
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
Which war

1632
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,575
Powerful Jewish interest have a Stranglehold on America

1633
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,367
Can government the economy in our culture

1634
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,951
We are in grave danger about that

1635
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
On the one hand

1636
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,535
And it's kind of intriguing to have this first step towards

1637
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,119
Alex take his feelings about the devil and Satanism

1638
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
3

1639
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,935
But on the other in much more serious and

1640
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:33,311
And it's a real problem when you pull the thread of what he's talking about and it leads back to another Austin

1641
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,383
Austin-based conspiracy theory who believe the Satanism is a

1642
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,455
The plot of the Jews it would be hard to believe that

1643
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,527
Living in Austin simultaneously

1644
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
No one

1645
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,087
Brought him up to Alex

1646
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
No one brought this guy up so Alex has no idea this is and this is all coming from his old 390 the text

1647
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,791
Has been on Alex's show before

1648
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,095
I know that although I don't

1649
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,679
I think that he plays as much of a role in later times

1650
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,983
I know that the name was, but one of the problems

1651
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
There's another guy

1652
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,311
Who's the conspiracy theorist named Jim Marrs

1653
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
So like

1654
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,663
I know he was on Alex's show a lot

1655
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,967
And I think the text Mars had a

1656
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,735
Lesser

1657
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,551
But definitely they still existing presence

1658
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
Right

1659
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
And they both

1660
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,135
Created Eminem's together

1661
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
Good joke

1662
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
Sorry

1663
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
I was jetty

1664
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,519
I'm really

1665
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
I'm really trying

1666
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
I did not expect

1667
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
51st

1668
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Like soda

1669
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,479
Fuller Overture towards

1670
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Talkin about

1671
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
Satanic

1672
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
Forces and what have you

1673
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,599
Would be in the context

1674
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,439
Of a story that was widely disseminated primarily by text

1675
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
It's Mars yeah who has a tendency

1676
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
C towards

1677
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Satanism

1678
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
And stop being coded ways for him to be after you submit

1679
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,167
Yeah that leads me to be very worried

1680
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
About

1681
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
How much more in

1682
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,775
These meticalica Shield may have been in

1683
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,151
Yeah it does seem like that I need to when I'm looking at these

1684
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Past episodes

1685
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
I need to be a little bit more

1686
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
Cognizant of that

1687
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
Cuz

1688
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
The question

1689
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
Could be raised like

1690
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
With the global

1691
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
Is he stealing

1692
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,767
Obviously effective anti-semitic propaganda

1693
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,327
In order to Rebrand it and use what is

1694
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
A very effective way

1695
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
To make his own money

1696
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
Or is he anti-Semitic

1697
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
And he's just

1698
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
Camouflaging

1699
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
That same

1700
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,567
Propaganda

1701
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,591
Under the terms

1702
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
God bless

1703
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,687
Yeah yo it's it's that kind of appropriation.

1704
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,735
Never really been able to

1705
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,039
To find definitive answers

1706
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:55,135
But it still seemed like I

1707
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,927
Because I don't believe

1708
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
That anybody

1709
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Anybody

1710
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,535
Could engage with the work

1711
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Architect Martha

1712
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,911
Puts out and not be aware of the particular character of anti-semitism

1713
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
280 Catholic

1714
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
He's that you just ate a lot of pee

1715
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,336
I don't think that you could

1716
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,872
For Alex to

1717
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Do you know

1718
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Seem to take

1719
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Information from his wife

1720
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,016
Seriously

1721
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
It makes you worried about what other stuff you might

1722
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
Yeah that's not good

1723
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,440
We we now jump to the 13th

1724
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,000
Because this sad that they have such a good time

1725
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
Dragon Alex

1726
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
That they just take calls

1727
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Chewy

1728
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
Oregon

1729
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,656
And overnight

1730
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,424
There was a bomb

1731
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,472
Megan Saudi Arabia there's a series of vomit

1732
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
Sure

1733
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,408
Give me the list of suspects

1734
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
It really could be

1735
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
So that keeps going

1736
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,568
Again

1737
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
It is a

1738
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:25,504
Really great example of a false-flag effectively turning a man into a dictator

1739
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
So there's that

1740
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
You suspect

1741
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
For this bombing

1742
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
And

1743
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
It's just based on

1744
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
Like he has nothing

1745
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
ITube demonstrate or prove

1746
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,840
This was an anyway anything other than suicide bombing

1747
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,936
Feels like maybe it's the CIA or Mossad

1748
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Feels like a cat

1749
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,824
So one of the things we've heard Alex say in various.

1750
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
The time is

1751
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,688
Conditional

1752
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Acceptance

1753
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:01,600
Of Wars of regime change

1754
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,304
Patrolling our borders

1755
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:18,496
But you know what can't really argue with

1756
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Again this

1757
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,720
This is the same thing as

1758
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,512
The thing about prison labor

1759
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Hits

1760
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,120
It's somebody who has the same position as you being opposed

1761
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,424
Go to prison labor being opposed to the war in Iraq

1762
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
But the reason

1763
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
Arnot

1764
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
The same

1765
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
And that's bad

1766
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:59,456
Yep cuz I was conditionally fine with regime-change Wars is on the table just leave him alone

1767
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,224
Arthritis bad

1768
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Sometime

1769
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:07,392
That's not good to know because if you solve the wrong problem

1770
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:13,792
Then the bigger problem is okay

1771
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,584
We can't have a dictator in the

1772
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:25,056
I don't mind as long as they leave me alone haha

1773
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,616
I tell people how to live now I should tell

1774
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,200
You I have studied everything about you

1775
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:36,064
Probably the only person who really understands it it is a voice against all foreign

1776
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,024
Cuz they cuz if you do my dictatorship you'll never have another dictator

1777
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Indicative

1778
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,376
Of the shallowness of Alex's opposite

1779
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,424
And the shallowness of his belief

1780
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
At least around the issues

1781
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,032
He presented himself as being

1782
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
On the Marquee

1783
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Certain

1784
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,176
It's really troubling me

1785
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Since I can't really get

1786
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Past is like

1787
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,296
How obvious it is

1788
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
Listening to this

1789
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,368
The even if you

1790
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,952
You didn't know that Alex turned into the biggest piece of s*** in the world

1791
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
If I heard him say that

1792
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,816
Back then I'll be like wait

1793
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,936
Wait a second you would be fine with this war if you didn't have your guns

1794
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,496
Hypothetically meeting to be registered

1795
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
I don't know

1796
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,872
You know that's one of those and I think what it is not so much

1797
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:38,528
That is as it is like I think about going back and watching a movie from the 90s now

1798
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
And stuff pops up in your leg

1799
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:45,952
I remember this movie is being one thing and now I saw this and I'm like no

1800
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:52,352
That's definitely true. You're going to win

1801
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
End up missing early like

1802
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,912
Skipping over in your brain

1803
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
Just stuff and be like

1804
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,984
He wasn't really thinking about that

1805
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,776
He's on the radio he's just talking

1806
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,800
You know like that kind

1807
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,152
I guess I guess that's true you can also you can account

1808
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
For like

1809
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,968
How differently you engage with things

1810
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,504
Based on the time

1811
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,576
Can I watch some of Eli

1812
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,624
Like Attitude Era wrestling

1813
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,464
Not too long ago couple years back and I was watching it

1814
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,024
Horrified

1815
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,816
Wow did not realize

1816
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,352
You go back in here like

1817
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Jesus

1818
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,496
Yeah so Alex has been

1819
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:34,336
The story the story of the episode is

1820
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
The bomb

1821
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
Saudi Arabia

1822
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
Not there is no

1823
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Real actual.

1824
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Discussion of it

1825
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
There's no

1826
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:47,136
I mean there's discussion of it but there's no information that he provides there's nothing

1827
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,952
Did you discuss that at the false-flag every information that you get

1828
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,768
False information Dan so you just got a

1829
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Speculum

1830
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,608
Right there's a lot of speculation and then also this

1831
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,888
This is what I think is the most

1832
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
Important thing

1833
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,872
Moron

1834
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,560
I have to save is a pretty desperate attempt to grasp

1835
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
Put straws on Alex's Park

1836
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,400
In order for his theories to make any sense

1837
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,704
Terrorist attacks have to match up with a drill

1838
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,800
And you can see here because he's already covered the top off Grill

1839
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,848
You accept any event as connect

1840
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,640
Regardless of how weak the Arkham

1841
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,504
I want to believe about the whole drill thing is that the globalist use Grill so they can have

1842
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,040
Plausible deniability

1843
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,136
In case one of their plans goes wrong or you know someone involved in the attack

1844
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Gets caught

1845
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,280
Princeton spell Runner bombing grow when they plan to carry out a bombing because that way they can plan out the details of

1846
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
The bombing

1847
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
You can say it's for the

1848
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,912
They're also ideas but have the globalist temp

1849
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:06,752
To tell you what they're doing before they do it according to some dumb intergalactic

1850
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,776
Contract law

1851
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
But generally speaking this concept

1852
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
The drills are used as cover

1853
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,872
Precentral to why the

1854
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,920
The connection between drilling event means any

1855
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:20,064
Alex's theories about the London 77 bombing rely on a misunderstanding about news reports about

1856
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,368
Consultant giving a brainstorming presentation

1857
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
Do business executives

1858
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,440
Where he had a scenario plan

1859
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,232
The closely mirrored the actual events

1860
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
The bombing

1861
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,560
That's a thin connection to draw but at least

1862
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:34,400
Is the subject matter of the scenario and the attack were similar enough

1863
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,192
They could see what Alex is trying

1864
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,496
In this instance

1865
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:44,128
There were a number of suicide bombings in residential compound in Riyadh that were generally known to be

1866
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
Occupied by foreigners

1867
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,432
Particularly West

1868
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
Meanwhile in

1869
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,320
Chicago in Seattle there was an inter-agency exercise going on that simulated

1870
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,904
A simultaneous biological attack in one city in a dirty bomb

1871
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Another

1872
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,000
These two situations lack the primary piece of the hole drill

1873
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Conspiracy puzzle

1874
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
Which is that they're abused

1875
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:06,144
The plan the attacks

1876
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:11,008
This is sloppy s*** and I'm kind of shocked that out to his listeners wouldn't realize this

1877
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,568
I can kind of understand buying a hole drilled

1878
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
Conspiracy when there's overlap

1879
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
Between the drill in the ocean

1880
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,480
And even pretty when you accept this nonsense like now Alex expect

1881
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,504
Like you to believe like a

1882
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,808
This extends this far

1883
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
Like these

1884
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,648
Completely unrelated and not even

1885
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,440
Thematically connected

1886
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,976
Scenarios

1887
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,792
Seattle and Chicago are somehow

1888
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
Related

1889
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
2

1890
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,632
Bombings in Riyadh

1891
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
Like when

1892
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,240
Like I'd very unpopular War

1893
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
Yeah happening

1894
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,056
Yeah in the rock

1895
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,616
That is that is probably one of the benefits

1896
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,896
It's for him of having

1897
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,688
Constant Global News

1898
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,736
Is at all times because something is always

1899
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Something else that he

1900
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,904
You know this is

1901
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,464
This is so it's weak s***

1902
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
It is weak tea

1903
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
It's

1904
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,328
It's always off

1905
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,912
I wouldn't if I were Alex I wouldn't even try this

1906
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:20,128
He's a young guy. He's an experienced he's really given you got to find your boundaries

1907
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
The only way to find your boundaries

1908
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
Is to Step Beyond

1909
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Implied

1910
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:29,088
Alex talked about this a little bit more and my only note on this is that this is unreal

1911
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,224
So now the bombings themselves arment

1912
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,576
To give credibility to the exercises that are being run in Seattle and

1913
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
What the f***

1914
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,672
No I'm very tired

1915
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
That exhaust

1916
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:11,840
You cannot eat your own tail at me

1917
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Yeah yeah

1918
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,960
It's not it's not fair it's not fair either these exercises are used to

1919
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
To provide cover and

1920
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,776
I'm planning for the globalist

1921
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,544
Sprite

1922
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,104
Or they're part of contract law

1923
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
Or

1924
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,152
There

1925
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:31,552
Not actually what time's the terrorist attack is actually about the exercise it's actually reverse

1926
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Twisted around so now that the

1927
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
Now the terrorist attack

1928
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
Is providing

1929
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,744
Cover for the drills

1930
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
It said of the drills I mean

1931
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,608
I guess the reality is they when anything is fake

1932
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
It doesn't matter

1933
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,192
And if you believe

1934
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
Like your editorial line for these narratives is

1935
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,544
They all this stuff is fake

1936
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:58,432
It's no longer disrespectful to take something like this because

1937
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:01,504
Okay. Position is just Expedia

1938
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,552
Whatever is

1939
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:10,976
I don't know if anybody is ever really truly made a career out of taking the path of least resistance

1940
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
Quite like Alex

1941
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
It's just like

1942
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
I'm just

1943
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:19,168
You know he's almost Reach This Then position of just flowing through the river

1944
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,984
Bulshit comes out of his mouth

1945
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:26,592
Ride along it behind his self-sustaining

1946
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:33,248
I have become one with the wind

1947
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,344
Alex pics

1948
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
Calls

1949
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,928
And he gets a call from a guy who

1950
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,976
It's pretty religious with him sure

1951
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,256
And it's interesting how

1952
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
On the scalp

1953
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,352
But I also spend my life

1954
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
Also in description

1955
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,192
And what's amazing to me

1956
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
Tokens

1957
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,520
Belly B Tires

1958
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,568
Yourself that there's a few others like

1959
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
You out there

1960
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:00,640
Description

1961
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,760
Call Dante

1962
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,536
Like you're in the Bible

1963
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,072
IMO calling

1964
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,352
To say that you're a prophet

1965
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,680
Listen I don't have that kind of stuff on my show cut up to

1966
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,336
Play 2 Chainz

1967
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,384
God damn that is fast

1968
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
So Alex

1969
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:38,272
Altima 2003 one of his primary

1970
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,040
Positions

1971
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,064
I am free

1972
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Strategies

1973
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
Birthdays anti-police

1974
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,256
Brutality and anti-police

1975
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
Easy way to look

1976
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,072
Above the left-right paradigm

1977
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,704
Infowars.com right now

1978
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,168
Parking ticket

1979
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,728
Obviously this is not something I'm okay with

1980
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,056
We should never behave this way and I think we can all agree on the

1981
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,456
I just find it interesting that Alex ends up taking almost an entire segment on the show to rant about this story which is

1982
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,736
Honestly tragic

1983
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:45,344
But definitely doesn't seem like something that needs to be front-and-center of the show's news that day

1984
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,416
Just makes me really sad to see him spending like 10 minutes

1985
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,952
Decrying the evils of the police

1986
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,976
Killing two dogs

1987
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,536
20 Ms later career he rationalized that

1988
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
Sometimes police are right when they shoot unarmed black people

1989
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,448
Personally I'm opposed to all active police violence but I don't

1990
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,800
Think like a story like this actually ranks is important news for a number of reasons

1991
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:09,664
The first is that even from Alex's headline you can tell that the city council person is

1992
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,688
Upset about this event

1993
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,992
To take appropriate steps to address

1994
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,552
The issue

1995
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,576
Instant you

1996
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,136
Can see on acceptable behavior from the police

1997
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
But you can also

1998
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,000
Almost be certain that the victim is going to win a civil suit and have some kind of rest

1999
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:24,768
Katusha

2000
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,048
And that's exactly what

2001
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
Did end up happening

2002
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,608
When they settle the claim against

2003
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:31,168
The cops who shot their dogs for $320,000

2004
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,496
Monica never make up for the loss of a love Pat but

2005
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,800
Me what can you do after the fact

2006
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,360
Hold people responsible and

2007
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,384
Pay the victor

2008
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,944
Even the story that came out in

2009
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,968
In the morning call

2010
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
About this shooting

2011
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,808
Prior to this episode that Alex's recording

2012
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,600
Quote another cop Who quote

2013
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:55,232
Said he wanted the family to know the constables carry up to $500,000 in liability insurance

2014
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,816
Quote we're walking cash cows for a good lawyer he said

2015
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,144
Even other cops in the department where they hang

2016
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,240
That they needed to do what needs to be done to make things right

2017
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:09,824
Cop reminds me so much of that Kyle Kinane bed

2018
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:15,712
Where is like you know you meet somebody you meet enough you live in interesting enough life you made it plenty of cops

2019
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:19,296
What should your day and every now and again you find what and who's just like

2020
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:25,696
For the grace of God go I was like I could have been working at a gas station or I can hang out being a cop

2021
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Play Starbucks better

2022
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
So

2023
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:33,632
Oh man that's great that cop just being like a man stupid s*** out of it

2024
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,936
A lot of insurance

2025
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
So we have one last clip

2026
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,776
Hear it it's another story that Alec

2027
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,592
It's a sort of touching on

2028
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
Really know the details

2029
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,640
Quarterback

2030
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,176
Orders

2031
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696
What they're talking about

2032
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,360
I don't know how

2033
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,664
How you doing

2034
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
Seems like if it's this kind of story is probably should have

2035
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,632
So what happened here is that there

2036
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,960
Look into taking control of the Texas legislature in the most recent election

2037
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,800
And I did include it harsh spending cuts

2038
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
Andre District

2039
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:23,712
How funny is it that we no longer live in a world where I can assume after you say the tech

2040
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,480
Texas Republic

2041
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,528
Control of the legislature

2042
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,552
That it would end in

2043
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
In an Alexa

2044
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,952
The Quorum of at least 100 of their members actually meet

2045
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,720
Vote on things

2046
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,536
So 58 of the Democrats in office decided

2047
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,560
Just an option

2048
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:42,656
That's a boy copy agenda that they were essentially powerless to stop in a vote

2049
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
This is something that

2050
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:48,032
And in response the house Speaker has the authority to send

2051
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,824
The Texas Rangers out to find them

2052
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,360
And bring them into vote

2053
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,896
It's basically hide-and-seek

2054
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
But with the government

2055
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:56,480
52 the lawmakers decided to

2056
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,248
Get out of the state

2057
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,064
In order to avoid being arrested so the speaker

2058
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,344
Acid help from other states

2059
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,136
To get them back into chamber

2060
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,976
An Associated Press article includes an amazingly did she respond

2061
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
That's from New Mexico attorney general Patricia Madrid

2062
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
Who said that she had quote

2063
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,888
No authority to arrest lawmakers who show up there

2064
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,424
But went on to say

2065
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:22,080
Nevertheless I have put out an all-points bulletin for law enforcement to be on the lookout for politicians in favor of healthcare for the needy

2066
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,640
And against tax cuts for the wealthy

2067
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:27,968
Goddamn

2068
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,808
Roast battle

2069
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:34,880
Goddamn return to the time had elapsed

2070
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,904
For the Bell but it didn't

2071
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,208
Matter Governor Rick Perry held repeated

2072
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:38,976
Special session

2073
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,768
To push through the redistricting plan

2074
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,048
Eventually got a pass

2075
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:46,400
Thereby gerrymandering the hell out of the State House districts and giving a very strong

2076
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
Republicans

2077
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,448
To remain in power

2078
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,568
How to pretending that this is an instance of power-mad folks having their political opponents arrested

2079
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,848
Sent to the hole

2080
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,128
But the reality is it

2081
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
Part of political maneuvering it's on

2082
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Common

2083
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,224
But it's not really outside of the

2084
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,760
The standard rules set forth by the time

2085
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
Texas house

2086
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,184
It's power-mad politicians so corrupt that they're willing to destroy their entire stay in order

2087
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,464
Ensure

2088
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:16,096
That right-wing politics rules the day but it has nothing to do with putting your political enemies

2089
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:23,264
The gerrymandering and the redistricting stuff is the real issue conversation

2090
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,592
Texas Rangers

2091
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,128
Put people back to vote

2092
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,944
Is a silly portion of

2093
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,736
The rules of

2094
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,600
Assertive government

2095
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,624
Procedure

2096
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,488
Yeah there's it there is that like I understand that we have those rules but

2097
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:51,424
Like how you have to say like a good shrub New Hampshire

2098
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,216
I don't need this b*******

2099
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,824
How we reach the end of this boring episode 13th

2100
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,640
I got to say

2101
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,920
Talk about that bombing

2102
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,456
Not a lot of

2103
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,480
Actual information

2104
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,784
But I think that we

2105
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,064
We stumbled upon something

2106
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:08,832
Fairly import

2107
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:12,160
Here and this is living underneath

2108
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
DC swallowing

2109
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
The blood of our children

2110
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,280
The way that this is

2111
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
Is characterized

2112
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
The way

2113
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Disorder

2114
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,144
I have a little bit of a clue

2115
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,192
Leading back to text Mars

2116
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,216
Is a b

2117
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,496
Troubling

2118
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,568
And I'm worried about what we're actually going

2119
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
Find

2120
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,896
Through this fanciful

2121
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
And seemingly

2122
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:40,832
Fun investigation that you when Alex started

2123
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
This to

2124
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,904
All rooted in

2125
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,720
Appropriated or

2126
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,256
Exploited

2127
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,280
Cosmetic ideas

2128
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:55,936
It's not what I would have liked does feel a lot like that day

2129
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,216
Kerry Cassidy

2130
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:00,288
Kind of an anti-semite

2131
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:03,104
Crumbled down and you like f*** all fun things

2132
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Just wind up with anti

2133
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:04,896
Semitism

2134
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,664
The bottom

2135
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
Brutal

2136
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Does

2137
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,760
Seems that this might be another into

2138
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,576
Another example of a

2139
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,648
We will see we will check back in

2140
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:19,232
