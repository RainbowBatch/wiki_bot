00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
With him which seems like a Fool's exercise quit

112
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Your heart is in the right place I don't know if it is but if I have to

113
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439

Nustep I'm positive

116
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
She did go cuz she spends about 5 minutes

117
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
Was told that her outfit wasn't appropriate

118
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
Okay fair enough you can't make that s*** I was like I'm not allowed to wear high heels because that's considered a weapon

119
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
I get inside and I see other people in high heels

120
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Maybe she's a higher standard of security

121
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,959
Seen you talk to this guy and other times

122
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519

00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
But you

124
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591

00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999

00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
She's allowed to use recorder when she goes an interview

142
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Please mark she's allowed to sometimes

143
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
She writes

144
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
Bizarre stupid questions

145
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479

I worried that we wouldn't be able to do an episode

150
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
When I was listening

151
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
To this

152
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Yeah

153
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Earlier

154
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Kinda is boring is she

155
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
Little bit boring

156
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,775
I listened back to it again

157
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
Was just my first

158
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,455
You know sometimes you read a book first-time through doesn't grab

159
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
To realize some of the nuances

160
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
Literally everyone feels about a separate

161
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
I don't know anything about it

162
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
I can tell you

00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351

New Theory

165
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Alright

166
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
The prison itself

167
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,543
0 limitations on what sort of recording devices that you are allowed

168
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Okay

169
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Mark Richards

170
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Is f****** with

171
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
And he is convinced a few of the guards

172
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
To go along with

173
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
I'm not sure I did actually find

174
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
It's not specified either way or not you can have a pen

175
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
It's not lip pencils and pens are not listed in

176
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Approved

177
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,911
Material but it's also not listed in like

178
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
I don't know I can't say either way

179
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
How do I

180
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,359
Restart this episode as we start every Project Camelot episode with introduction

181
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895

Song of the Dutchman and I believe in this

186
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,263
His grandfather would have

187
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,639
Now I understand it'll light not have listened to our Pact

188
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175

With Mark Richards

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Before she gets into

191
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
Carrie gives a little bit of a breakdown of

192
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
The relevant information you need to know

193
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
About

194
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751
Recently went to interview Captain Mark Richards who has been involved in the secret space program since he was a young

195
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Child actually

196
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,407
And his father was also involved as well as his grandfather if I understand

197
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
And his father was known as the Dutchman he was

198
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
Quite famous in those

199
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Save the world

200
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
Multiple database program circles if you want to call it that the military

201
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
As well as in the British in Britain with the British and so

202
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
Has a long history as I say with regard to the secret space program

203
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
He

204
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Basically grew up in

205
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
Basically grew up and he's like a Jonathan Taylor Thomas

206
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
Why is that the only child actor idea why that happened he grew up in Show Business

207
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:41,599
Jonathan Taylor Thomas

208
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
Absolutely awesome career

209
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Odd Squad

210
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,055
Carrie sort of really understanding this Richards has been involved

211
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Space Program

212
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
The kid

213
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
He also had like we reference

214
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
B of A sentient spaceship named Minerva

215
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Can fly around it

216
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
He is married to a lady named Joanne Richards

217
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
It goes around again

218
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Peaches on his behalf

219
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
An actual real person

220
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
A human being and not part of the grand mythology

221
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,959
Photo married to Minerva in

222
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Confirm is the Cheese's

223
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
PA

224
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
The rest of the stuff is I think she's being tricked by her husband

225
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Is she

226
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
No idea

227
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Never find

228
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
We need to hire her

229
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Mythology

230
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,791
To know is that it

231
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Because

232
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Was

233
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
The orchestrated the murder of a guy who

234
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
He got

235
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,263
Do kids who worked at tire shop I believe

236
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Something along those lines

237
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
Sea-Doo from that you offered them $5,000 in

238
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,271
A car a car Pursuit

239
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,367
When the murder was committed

240
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
And I date

241
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
So

242
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Seems like

243
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Cost more than that and yet it never does

244
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
You know

245
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
AAA

246
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Really cheap

247
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
You know

248
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Of the job

249
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Needs to be done

250
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
Is it function of the desperateness of the

251
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,943
Your lawn mowed for like $200 by a profession

252
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
No crew or

253
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
$3 to

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
To the neighbor kid

255
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
A meme for $200

256
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Can convince the neighbor kids

257
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,999
To kill the professional long possible I take over the business

258
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
From living in reality that Mark Richards

259
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Straight up did that s***

260
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
As far as I'm concerned he's one of the best

261
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Whistleblowers out there

262
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,919
The fact that he is in prison and has been for over 30 years

263
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Is what the

264
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Powers that be considered to be

265
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
Sufficient enough to discredit him

266
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
So that he will not be believed

267
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,791
So he is at Liberty to tell me quite a bit of information that you can't get anywhere else

268
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,631
This is how we work the sort of rationale

269
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
He's in prison

270
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
He's been discredited so much that it doesn't

271
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Matter who tells the truth

272
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
No one's going to believe him cuz he's

273
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Murderer

274
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,199
So the powers-that-be are like whatever you want big guy

275
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Have fun there another

276
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
Even if he had murdered zero

277
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
And we're free

278
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
I would say so I mean

279
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
There's a little bar for Carrie

280
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
Episodes with Carrie talk

281
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,799
I have a hard time believing they are not

282
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Eligible for

283
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,407
Do you know what I mean like if anybody really wanted to look into it

284
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Every single item probably of tax crimes in there in the past

285
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
The delowe

286
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Low-level

287
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
Almost all of them I would say

288
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Have

289
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,607
Maybe a civil fraud case

290
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Go to prison

291
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,543
They all should be sued by somebody

292
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
So anyway Marcus guilty of this

293
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
You're being orchestrated murder but turns out

294
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
She is innocent of the crime

295
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:00,671
Infor and as I say spent over 30 years paying for a crime he didn't commit

296
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255
And he is

297
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
You've been in prison

298
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Like

299
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,447
Two months shorter than I've been alive

300
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
He was 19 years into his presence

301
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
Let's

302
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Said to be the Mastermind

303
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Two other people who actually committed the murder

304
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
One of them got out off

305
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
I guess bye

306
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
The other one

307
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
He cut a deal because he was like oh my God I'm going to be in prison for the rest of my life

308
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
I will cut a deal

309
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Very common

310
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
As well as Mark

311
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,823
And now this guy whose name is cross and David

312
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Uber

313
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Apparently is

314
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Talking to a journalist too

315
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,319
A radio talk show host in Britain who has decided to make a documentary

316
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Supporting

317
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
The murderer

318
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Against Mark Richards

319
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
I was promised them that they would be nice if

320
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
After

321
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,615
Is the murderer ended up taking over Marin County

322
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,807
It's amazing I can't wait for

323
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,695
I would love to hear what you told these kids perspective

324
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Viking what they

325
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Experian

326
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,119
Girl no

327
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
Throwing caution to the wind

328
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
To be fair

329
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,127
It is in the next clip carry will explain that Mark can't talk about his legal issues

330
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
And

331
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Kind

332
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
Mark Richards has been working with the lawyer

333
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Which is long overdue

334
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
And this

335
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,167
Happening on the side is is not a good thing obviously

336
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
A documentary that is supposed to

337
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Being negative influence I guess on the public

338
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,223
Attitude towards Mark but nonetheless

339
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,855
What's happening now is that they are not able to talk to anyone about the

340
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
Simply because they are involved in

341
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,255
Guy with a lawyer in getting a commutation of his son

342
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Hopefully that will happen

343
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Doubt it

344
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,287
Call Richard you better have the lawyers

345
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
He has life without parole

346
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,175
From what I understand the guy

347
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Committed the murder

348
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Has the possibility of

349
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Parole

350
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
So I would say

351
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
The f****** psycho

352
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeah I think the facts

353
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
The case bore out in such a wave

354
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,815
Who's the most dangerous here who has the potential for rehabilitation

355
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,191
It's scarier that the kid would actually was the one who did the murder

356
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
That's scary

357
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
You would think that

358
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Come with a heavier set

359
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,639
At the same time

360
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
I think that is probably

361
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,295
Pretty reasonable at this point 30 years later 34 years later

362
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Affect

363
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Kid now

364
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
An adult has

365
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Rehabilitated

366
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
He's not going

367
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Commit another murder unless another Mark Richard Getz

368
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
So like

369
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,471
The idea that that kid could get out and Mark can't

370
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
I'm fine with

371
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
So I belittle

372
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Knows so much more about

373
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Cakewalk prison

374
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
I bet it's

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
And may our story I could find was from a couple years

376
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
It was like a big fight

377
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
Broke out in the prison in the aftermath

378
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
A guy

379
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Who was cut in half

380
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
Totally specials

381
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,648
The whole process what is totally

382
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:52,000
Guy in half and stuffed in like somebody

383
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Disposal

384
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
Well that's right to hide the bodies in the investigation they found a couple of his organs were missing

385
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
From the articles I could find anywhere so I didn't.

386
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,736
Didn't look too deeply into this I'm sure there's a resolution somewhere put the stories that I really like

387
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
No one knows what happened what

388
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Alright

389
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Here's our plan

390
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
We're going to sell a liver

391
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
Why not

392
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
40 feet of

393
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
But we got to start a huge prison fight

394
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
This is Ocean's 11 but it was one

395
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,088
Fairmount of like lockup

396
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
This story was like

397
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,464
What the f*** I think I want to learn more about the

398
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,072
Related to work I'm supposed to be doing

399
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Get I kind of get wanting to

400
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Pretended imagine

401
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,664
Fantasize about the ID

402
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
Commuted though you're living in that sort of a

403
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,808
Mark was at

404
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
But that's terrifying

405
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Who did it

406
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
I don't know

407
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
The f****** lieutenant

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
No no Mark Richards best because

409
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Minerva

410
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
He's off of Oregon

411
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
She needs a few organs and he was like listen I can get my hands all over

412
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
You got to cut a guy in have I was

413
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Praying

414
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Not praying

415
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Make me happy but

416
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
I was kind of interested

417
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Recognize any

418
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,256
Players in this article

419
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
Like the guy who died

420
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
Related to Mark Richard

421
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
I'm more interested now in like being called

422
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
To deposition

423
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Commutation

424
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
We have brought in

425
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
2 random ass guy

426
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Do you guys feel like

427
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
I suppose we have to have a

428
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
WYD

429
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,592
All right there wouldn't be a commutation hearing because there's no

430
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Hearing it's Justin

431
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Governor Whitmer

432
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Or something like that

433
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Commuted

434
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Because Carrie knows something

435
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
Terry knows something she's gotten some information

436
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
About the future of Mark rich

437
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,144
For those of you that know that I interviewed Simon parkes

438
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
Many times and recently used to be a council person and

439
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,688
You carry who would like two or three times a year would leave and have sex with

440
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,856
By far the most heroic character on Project Camelot

441
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
And more than once he has said that Mark Richards

442
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
Will likely be pardoned very soon

443
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
As a result

444
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
After what

445
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,960
What is basically the indictments that are going through right now

446
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,800
So the indictments are being pursued there something like 40,000

447
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
50000

448
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,896
According to Simon parkes once those

449
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Mike Richards will be

450
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
So

451
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
Alright

452
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Is it

453
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
Hunan's conspiracy in the

454
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
Excited

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
About it is

456
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
The part of the narrative is

457
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Is that the justice department

458
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Filed 4050

459
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
3000

460
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Sealed indictments

461
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Shoulder just ready to go

462
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,616
And that's why they keep making all these stories up about like Hillary Clinton

463
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
Leaving the country before these

464
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,040
Indictments get on co2 cuz you know she's going away forever once I do

465
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Shirt so that's

466
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
That's a big big

467
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Piece of the Q10

468
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Non-Stop

469
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
These indictments are going to come down they're going to roll up all the

470
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,400
Evil forces and government

471
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
Part of that Trump is going to

472
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Mark Richards

473
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
For some reason why not because he knows about the

474
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,504
Trump knows that's why he's doing space force as f****** Mark rich is going to be the head

475
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Alright

476
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
One thing I don't care

477
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
Now that I know a guy's been cut in half

478
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
I kind of am fine with the no pens or pencils kuleto's

479
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
Crayons

480
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,336
Totally reasonable

481
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,152
Unreasonable to think that Tycoon on stuff is

482
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Is true and if somehow it's going to

483
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Intersect with Mark Richard

484
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Still going on people are still into it

485
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
Cuz

486
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
People get tricked and so there is like a there's a ego aspect

487
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
And later is like

488
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,176
I got tricked by Bosa

489
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
There's also a pack

490
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
Republican party is it like lost time fallacy

491
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
A year into studying this qanon stuff

492
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
That time is now decide its all full of s***

493
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
So I think that a lot of people who should be the light

494
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
And be like this is all nonsense

495
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
Walt because those forces

496
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,920
That's a music

497
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,296
A28

498
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
2018

499
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,696
Reimagining of nunsense okay alright

500
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632
Just got a direct sequel It's just nonsense but it's all about

501
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
These sealed indictment

502
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Saying it's

503
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
The Calm before the storm

504
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
Alright I see I see a little bit of Mamma Mia

505
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
No no

506
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Jerome corsi

507
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
No but he's an interesting

508
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Conduit

509
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
Tell the story

510
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,560
I bet it turned against him

511
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
So if you'll be an interesting protagonist

512
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,936
He's the only person who has a

513
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:38,944
This point

514
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
Oh my God

515
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,768
I was just trying to harmonize I thought you're going to go for another line

516
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
Carrie went to prison

517
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Go talk to Mark but you should know

518
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Did this wasn't the only interview that

519
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Did she had plan

520
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
It's also important that people realize

521
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Where are where

522
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:11,200
That I went to interview someone else this time as well on my way

523
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,296
We had originally been

524
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Interested in doing an interview with me

525
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Suddenly

526
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
And what happened

527
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
I think he must have been intimidated

528
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
Nope she suddenly acted as though he barely knew me and so that works

529
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,800
Affinity he was no longer available and on top of it she said he

530
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,712
Knows nothing about the secret space program even if they did it would be a felony

531
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
To divulge anything about it it's real

532
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
No it's not

533
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
Basically

534
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,512
So but that he's no longer able to talk

535
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:02,144
He said this is not the time for in-person interviews

536
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
4in person discussion

537
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
And

538
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
So this is what

539
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
With going on

540
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,664
So it's very interesting because this is a very

541
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
Tents time

542
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
It's quite an exciting time

543
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
A time when the

544
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,208
Trump Administration the people that are backing him basically the military

545
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
These indictments are coming through there's 40

546
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
40000 to 50,000

547
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,216
A hiver actually pursuing them as I speak

548
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Inferior

549
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
In reality

550
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,384
She's just sort of combining ethology with Cuba

551
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,248
About the military being

552
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
I meant throwing in the qanon sealed indictments s***

553
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,672
It is time to be alive when you're into this stuff

554
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,768
A year from now it's not going to be that exciting your parotid hasn't

555
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Revolve the doll

556
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,144
2012 credibly exciting

557
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Sure you have to hold

558
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,032
You could do the whole thing and maybe 2013

559
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Top there's a hangover

560
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
Got a little bit of onion

561
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
We got to start

562
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,248
Do the whole thing all over again

563
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
So carry thinking that she's going to go interview someone in the guy being like no

564
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
.

565
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
No I'm pretty sure that confirms everything that Mark Richard says his trip

566
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
Rubber back on that episode where she was interviewing the guy who works at a bus station take pictures of the moon

567
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,384
Thought that you confirm the time of the interview and then got on airs like I don't know where

568
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,504
Sure I'm talking about the professionalism of setting up the interviews

569
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Confirm the time

570
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
There's a load up

571
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
It's somebody's play sounds like this

572
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,048
What do her lack of professionalism

573
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,376
Aziz Aziz interview

574
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
Yeah we didn't agree on a f****** time lady don't show up in my goddamn house

575
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
Children who think I'm normal

576
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Possibility

577
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
And none of them in the real world are

578
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
This guy is f****** scared cuz

579
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
We're talkin

580
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
The only way I the only way I could think that

581
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
She has any kind of option

582
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
As if it was another guy in the same

583
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,608
Prison

584
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Listen I'm not authorized

585
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
It's to talk to you

586
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,728
I'm not good at Improv

587
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
My eyebrow Waggles suggesting that whatever it is you said was true is not up to par

588
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Exactly

589
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Because my response is going to be like

590
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Come on man

591
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
So there is a fundamental problem

592
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
With carries energy

593
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
But she does with Mark today

594
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,000
She's at the end of that life either crazy time

595
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,352
Yes question reduces the idea that the times are so crazy

596
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
The mark Maybe

597
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Talk about summer

598
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,752
Because it's such a height and time

599
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
She was not able to

600
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,128
Talk about certain things with me he has been instructed

601
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
On what to say and what not to say

602
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,784
He does not have a working with the military

603
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
In the secret space program

604
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
And she is

605
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,280
No longer reporting cooperate he says

606
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,864
Bobby Ray and Menace no longer involved is how we put it

607
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
He is now

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,776
I'd like to say that I think that's code for someone called Bobby Ray

609
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
According to a different

610
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
Sector of the US military a division that he's not at Liberty to disclose

611
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
He said one of the reasons

612
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:09,696
She is able to talk obviously and other people may be more hesitant to do so is that

613
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,536
She is in prison and obviously has this disclaimer

614
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Which is an

615
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Fasten sort of

616
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
Credibility issue

617
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
No s*** is

618
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
Well first of

619
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
No I fully I

620
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Really

621
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Finally come to

622
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Conclusion that none of this

623
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Because

624
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,296
Well, I've had a long day

625
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Bitter rivalry

626
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
They have been playing

627
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:45,280
Space football games every year and 8

628
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,680
This makes me think of you know Howard Kramer

629
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Power climber who loves

630
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
The ocean

631
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,600
Program loggerheads

632
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,928
Mark Richardson

633
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Synthesizer

634
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
Attacked by an octopus

635
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
You just punched

636
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Godot

637
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
I love first of all time

638
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
I think that

639
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,056
He has needed to get the specifics out of some of

640
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
Story

641
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
People look into them

642
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,712
Military organization

643
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
Which is good that should have been the case all along

644
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
Because this is a load of hot b*******

645
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,536
Carry that must have been like the best mom

646
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
If you don't give

647
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Specifics I don't have

648
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
The defendant

649
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
Is it so much easier

650
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,544
Right right

651
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
How many can look it up

652
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
Video game

653
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
Your military organization

654
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,040
Mothership is from this

655
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Now I've got it

656
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:19,232
Baker's know about media you making this so complicated

657
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm carry the curator okay

658
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Canelo Jordan

659
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
I know that we come from a position

660
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Of assuming that Mark

661
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Because he is

662
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,336
You should know

663
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
But you should know something about it

664
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:43,552
He basically told me he would always tell me the truth if there were ongoing operations that were being conducted

665
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
By his side

666
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,672
Or the side that involves the Raptors and the military

667
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
Is she reports to

668
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
He would obviously not be revealing things that could endanger

669
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
Their operations and he wanted me to know that

670
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
You better know

671
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,960
Know that information

672
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
The jeopardizes the precious Raptor Force

673
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,872
How dare you assume I'm going to lie to you if it

674
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,712
Reality winner

675
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,088
We can't be doing that to the Raptor Raptor or not reality winner did not deserve

676
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,184
The mark Richards would agree with me on that

677
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
What's that

678
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
What what

679
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Is the sentence

680
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Could do it

681
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352
You know Sadie Kerry Cassidy

682
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
I will never lie to

683
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Right

684
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Disqualified

685
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,616
Continue continue with I will never lie to you

686
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,712
I will not divulge information regarding the

687
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:50,368
Sensitive receptor operations that are ongoing people who make

688
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
Unnecessary

689
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Just sort of

690
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
Out of nowhere black

691
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,376
Usually you're overcompensating a little bitty baby

692
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
Yeah I don't know that's just something I felt

693
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
I don't know maybe Mark Richards is trying to

694
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,992
That's what I feel a hundred percent

695
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Trying to send that nice Edge

696
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
Her on a laser level

697
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Eddie would never bother

698
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Payment there

699
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
Thrill of the hunt I'm like a serial killer part of

700
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
Thing is I want

701
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
To be caught kill a rabbit

702
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
They can't hurt you

703
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,592
You could kill sucking

704
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Tiger

705
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Bright

706
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
Excitement

707
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Yeah yeah

708
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
You going to

709
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Like Icarus is flying

710
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
Too close to the Sun

711
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
I never f****** love you

712
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
But there's a new documentary

713
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
This guy who

714
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Free climbs

715
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,680
I don't see that s*** all

716
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,568
Memories everybody on the like

717
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
He's free climbing this incredibly

718
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
Play Moore's

719
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:27,136
No safety harnesses are at all bro on

720
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,464
Sing about the movie though it's like

721
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
The camera crew

722
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Are we

723
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,120
Is it okay for us to film a guide

724
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
You might fall and die

725
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:45,056
Is that okay

726
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
Share any fault

727
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Does a GoPro on

728
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Cuz that's going to be whether or not I

729
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
Because I

730
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,880
I've seen those videos of them like climbing up buildings

731
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
And stuff like that

732
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,560
Hundreds of feet in the air floors in the area

733
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
I feel it in my teeth

734
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,472
So f****** uncomfortable Turner on fire in a way that you can't comprehend

735
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
Triggers

736
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Passed I passed on

737
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
GoPro I will I will tell you this right now

738
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
You shouldn't

739
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
Slightest bit

740
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Seen and read about it

741
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
It's like

742
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,024
Hey have you ever had your balls drop later in life

743
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
That's what he feels

744
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
I'll let you be excited about that

745
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Memory and I will

746
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Continue to be

747
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:48,544
Coming out on

748
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,640
Super Nintendo

749
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
I love that Louis making so much

750
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
Mario

751
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
And put into a painting

752
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
That makes more sense

753
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
Anyway

754
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Yes

755
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,311
We find one of the first instances of Mark having something

756
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
You can't talk

757
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,663
The Carrie brings up

758
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
The yarn about it

759
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,503
Guess what this is one of those things that I can actually tell you

760
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
The other end of this play

761
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:38,719
We talked about then the Sun and he said this was the an area he could not talk to me

762
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Me about

763
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
Or couldn't say much about

764
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
We did talk about the next the New Mexico Observatory that has been

765
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,311
Close is very well known at this point

766
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:58,943
A lot of misleading stuff in the in the mainstream media and also and they alter

767
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
Lot of people not getting the real story behind it

768
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,623
I have had some very excellent source material on this

769
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Coming from a secret Witness

770
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
Do you say infiltrated that

771
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
Channel chatter

772
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
Going on at the observatory there were seven others around the world that were also tells down

773
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
Is not hold water

774
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,151
The FBI was certainly we're simply that they sort of

775
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,503
Pony show that you were supposed to be misled by

776
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
What the information I got was

777
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
From this soda Secret store

778
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,279
Marc's

779
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,167
Trading of information more-is-more to the point of what really goes on when I talk tomorrow

780
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,543
Brittany Ray weather observatory in New Mexico

781
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
And the other Observatory

782
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,175
They were attempting to use a kind of superluminal

783
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
Technology which is called

784
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,831
Possibly based on quantum mechanics

785
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
So

786
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Come on

787
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
Jurassic technology

788
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
You got to jump to quantum computer

789
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
Vanguard

790
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
Distance right now

791
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
You can't say

792
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
Possibly based on quantum mechanics

793
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
What the f*** you mean she doesn't have an explanation

794
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
That's where her explanation visit

795
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,831
Yeah possibly

796
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,415
Like she started this ends by saying there's this technology

797
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,975
It was being used that's called

798
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
It might use quantum mechanics

799
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
There's this theory about

800
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Strings

801
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,959
So

802
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,775
He's brought up in a couple of

803
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,639
There was a

804
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
New Mexico.

805
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Do you know about that

806
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
Because they finally found the Sun

807
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
No more need for this

808
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,487
It's up there

809
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
It's

810
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,375
So curious version of the story

811
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Scary version of the story is at the national

812
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
Close down

813
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
Along with many others

814
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Yes you brought up there and they clips

815
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
To do with an unnamed and unexplained

816
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
Curious technology that may or may not involve quantum mechanics

817
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,575
I just pretty much always the case I'll project Campbell

818
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,879
Gary's reality is far more fun

819
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Show me actual real

820
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
From The Washington Post

821
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,255
What triggered the observatory

822
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:57,119
Complete shutdown was it

823
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Distribute child pronography

824
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,471
According to court documents

825
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
Kinder was Distributing c****************

826
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:15,295
No no no no no idea that this Nationals

827
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
Solar Observatory was closed

828
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
B

829
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
Community online

830
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Explained

831
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
The closure of the

832
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
This place but in reality when all the dust settles

833
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
The details were

834
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
Distributing c**************** on their Wi-Fi

835
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
Well there's more to it

836
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Okay

837
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,687
002

838
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Yep

839
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
This is according

840
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
Newly unsealed court docket

841
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
In July FBI agents investigating child sexual exploitation trace the location of several IP addresses

842
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
Pornography

843
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,679
Interview with Federal authorities on August 21st of this year

844
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Facilities chief

845
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,519
Observers said that he was found on a number of occasions

846
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
The same laptops

847
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
And running in various seldom-used offices around the observatory

848
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
He described the contents of the laptop as quote

849
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
Not good

850
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,759
According to court documents

851
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Let's

852
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
Really sums it up yeah. Good look at that.

853
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:34,143
Good if you're investigating child pronography and you're

854
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,543
Gnosis is not good I can assume that in my world that's the single worst thing that could possibly happen

855
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,615
Understand why the chief Observer of this

856
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,711
The place might not want

857
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Potter sucks

858
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,039
Or something like that

859
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
I can understand someone using

860
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Colloquialism

861
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
Authorities Authority

862
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,535
Yeah

863
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,447
Okay Vision only

864
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,311
Please note

865
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,431
Take it away from my eyes forever please

866
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Chief Observer when

867
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
I spoke to they adore

868
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
Yeah federal agent was dispatched to investigate

869
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
Taking that laptop

870
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,207
And it was founded

871
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:40,703
The day after allegedly seen by the chief Observer leaving the office

872
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,543
The chief Observer interaction to Federal

873
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
Anyone that entered the office

874
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
Because the cleaning supplies he had left there were missing

875
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:55,551
Later the janitor claim courts Observatory late night in order to steal the wireless internet service

876
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,879
And express concerns about lack security Court

877
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Report

878
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
What you see here very clearly

879
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
That guy wasn't even f****** try

880
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,567
He's trying to cover his tracks

881
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,639
This turns into outright

882
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Again from the washing

883
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
You can post

884
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,063
The janitors actions allegedly became even more bizarre

885
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Become worried about their own safety

886
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
Feverishly search the facility

887
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Did the quote

888
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,071
It's only a matter of time before the facility got hit

889
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,167
I believe there was a serial killer in the area

890
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
The killer might enter the

891
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
Annex

892
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Acute somebody

893
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,311
Because of his erratic behavior and his references

894
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,175
To the potential murder someone at the facility

895
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Facility down

896
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,503
And evacuate their employees

897
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
The FBI did not make that decision

898
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:04,415
And it's against their interests as they were still engaged in active investigation

899
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
Everyone online misrepresented

900
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,791
Misreported the event is the FBI's shutting down

901
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
Because it was an actor

902
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Give investigation

903
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,191
No one in the know with willing to officially comment on it until much later

904
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,007
Basically until mid-september

905
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,407
Reality is

906
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Guy shut down the observatory because he was like

907
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,135
Not just him

908
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,471
Hey people are going to get murdered if we don't know if I can deal with it and the FBI

909
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
You don't know that for sure

910
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,895
You can't take risk and that's a situation

911
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
Using bootlegged Wi-Fi in order

912
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
To distribute c****************

913
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
They start acting super radically when it's clear that there The Jig Is up about the pasta

914
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Ability

915
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Did someone

916
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
To be murdered

917
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:16,351
Because of the killer in the area that's going to break someone has been breaking in at night

918
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,311
Get it like there wasn't me it was someone else to broken now he's using that someone's going to break in and kill people

919
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Is not

920
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
Super crazy to think

921
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Only like if they left it open

922
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:45,023
Call Bev hanging in the act

923
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
Probably enough

924
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
Information

925
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,631
Evidence in order to

926
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
But at the same time

927
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
It would be much easier

928
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
Controlled environment

929
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,055
To allow him

930
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Be under surveillance

931
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
And commit the crime

932
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
He was already

933
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
In order to make a

934
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
That much easier

935
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Arizona

936
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
No New Mexico

937
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
New Mexico

938
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,343
Not far away from the

939
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
You should have just bail

940
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
Photos

941
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,255
From when

942
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
You just can't

943
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
You can't stop yourself from

944
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Expressing

945
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,823
Decent whether it's for villains or Heroes

946
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,431
I should be a consultant

947
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Amoral

948
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,783
Consult

949
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
I'm from when of the

950
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,439
People in charge of the solar Observatory shutdown

951
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,767
And the time when

952
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
And the story started to come out

953
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
When

954
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
The FBI had enough

955
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,679
Evidence at their disposal they could talk about

956
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
Hey people we're getting the

957
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Clearance

958
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
Comment

959
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
Observer

960
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,943
Credible sources

961
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,247
Internet bullshiter started

962
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,855
That the FBI shut down the place because they had spotted real alien

963
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
And this was a he

964
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Huge cover-up

965
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,535
Even Outlets like zero just got in on the ACT reporting about the closure as if it was somehow suspicious

966
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
Along the way was pointed out that

967
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
A bunch of other webcam

968
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Reservatory

969
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,423
Offline around this thing

970
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
Time

971
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
Took it must be a smattering of solar Observer

972
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
Rotary closure

973
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:37,407
Probably because they thought of giant Sunspot that was going to destroy the world

974
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
And they didn't want that info getting out

975
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,759
Kind of

976
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
And her

977
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,111
Siri when she's bringing up all these other places that

978
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
She's not willing to be so

979
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Specific

980
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
That's fine

981
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
The online conspiracies were

982
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:57,119
It primarily initially about the idea to take it sound real alien and then secondarily

983
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
Unclear if there were a bunch

984
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Other webcams that were down

985
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Other Observers

986
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
Runaway from being jumped

987
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
And then it became

988
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,151
About the ideas found

989
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,455
World-destroying event

990
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
That was

991
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
Yeah exactly

992
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
So

993
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
Whoever pointed this out

994
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,439
The observation

995
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,303
Yeah on the front page of the Soul

996
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Heliosphere

997
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,143
Observatory website where you find all of the

998
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
These webcam

999
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
There's an announcement prominently displayed

1000
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,871
We are updating the code infrastructure that provides access to srrho data

1001
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,919
We expect the work to take several

1002
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,319
Their website and does access to streaming app for webcam

1003
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,135
Temporarily

1004
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
Completely unrelated

1005
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
The situation

1006
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
So what you have there is

1007
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
Influence of

1008
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
Again it's all intention

1009
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Understanding

1010
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,375
Of information

1011
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,959
Immediately in the aftermath of

1012
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
New Mexico

1013
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Trattoria being closed

1014
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,151
Kept really tight

1015
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
Think about what you could roll up

1016
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Who are you in

1017
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Business

1018
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,575
Yeah I know there is a possibility of absolutely

1019
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
I think it's

1020
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
A Dangerous Game

1021
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,975
Play because you don't know what kind of Rogue variable this guy is

1022
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,535
If you're law enforcement

1023
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
I get it

1024
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
No one's going to be able to talk about that

1025
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,911
That's so.

1026
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
The world

1027
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Carrie Reichert

1028
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
People online start

1029
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,615
They find all these webcam they don't know how to read

1030
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,711
So they don't see the warning that says we're updating the website for take bunch of weed

1031
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,831
Will take about a week

1032
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,879
Goddamn

1033
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
These pages

1034
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
At all possible

1035
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,775
Carrie is still in Wellington

1036
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,079
If if her version

1037
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
Then there are so many people

1038
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Who has

1039
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Willingly perjured themselves for

1040
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
For no reason

1041
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
Like all of the people swore affidavits

1042
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
About this janitor

1043
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
All of the law enforcement

1044
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
Who wrote These warrants

1045
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
The people who made these

1046
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
He's 39 page

1047
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,279
Decorations

1048
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
Like all of them

1049
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:40,959
R32 50,000 indictments are coming down Dan you think those people are involved I guess if you believe

1050
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Give that thing

1051
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Amazing

1052
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
How escalation actually works

1053
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
In this circumstance

1054
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,063
Because like when we're dealing with Alex Jones they were talking about

1055
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,111
The conspiracy is always there

1056
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
Covering up pedophile

1057
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
But in this case tonight cuz they were actually covering up but they were covering

1058
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Whittier

1059
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
I think I accidentally

1060
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,471
Realizes

1061
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
Epicure Non-Stop

1062
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
Yeah I call a lot of these

1063
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Sealed indictment

1064
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:24,479
Weird globalist pedophile network operations

1065
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Both

1066
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
All this is

1067
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
Coming down the pike

1068
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
You just got it

1069
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
You got a trust

1070
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Trust the process

1071
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Going on

1072
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
It's all going to come to light

1073
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Indicted already they don't know it

1074
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,959
Meanwhile we have a situation here

1075
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,775
We have a situation here

1076
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Dude

1077
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Who is

1078
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
Distributing c****************

1079
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,895
In a government

1080
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
Building

1081
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
Angela

1082
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,063
Cover up that's just a cover story

1083
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,951
Macabre story

1084
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:13,375
You know ahead of the solar Observatory

1085
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,959
Cornelia

1086
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,519
Movies they love

1087
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
Storiesig

1088
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Overarching fiction

1089
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
One of those ways

1090
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,319
Be very easy to do this would be a great episode Law & Order

1091
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
Because of the

1092
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,183
Great Gatsby

1093
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
Alright are you make this work

1094
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,095
Alright

1095
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
Observatory

1096
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Who looks at

1097
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,287
There's all these kids out there looking at the sun

1098
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
That's how they

1099
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
Call solar Gleaners

1100
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
I don't know if that wasn't

1101
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,039
But a way to make the story more compelling for Carrie if she wanted to like actually look at

1102
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,831
The reality of it

1103
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
You could go down

1104
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Organic

1105
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,207
My time

1106
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
But the gender was there

1107
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
Because his parents

1108
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,071
Contract

1109
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
With a bunch of places

1110
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
So there is

1111
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
So there actually is a conspiracy theory story to be told Eric I mean if you want to stretch for it really far yet

1112
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,127
That's one of the reasons that you felt so protected

1113
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,991
And yeah career there and maybe one of the reasons why you didn't

1114
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
He's working there under the office

1115
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Powerful contract

1116
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Company

1117
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
With a bunch

1118
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Other love

1119
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Probably a number of

1120
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Stuff like that

1121
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Working at this

1122
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
Seefeldt

1123
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Entitled and Celta Bulletproof

1124
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Something like that

1125
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
I think that would be far too much for us to

1126
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,567
Yeah

1127
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,431
She should go

1128
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,527
A cover-up of something because it's a lot of bulshit

1129
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
From Mark

1130
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
Consulting firm

1131
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,159
This is going to be like

1132
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
The first

1133
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
First rule

1134
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,255
Underrated option

1135
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,303
Bail and run

1136
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
You know

1137
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:23,679
Like there's so many times if you would just really committed to bailing and running

1138
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
Probably would have been fine

1139
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
I would say won't be rule number one but it will be in the handbook

1140
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
Run it's like

1141
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,223
I didn't say just run I said it's an underrated

1142
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
It's not even that it's an underrated option

1143
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,063
It is an option

1144
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
Available to you

1145
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
For a while that will not available eventually

1146
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:52,607
Malaysian Teton running you need to be aware of it

1147
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,143
There's always

1148
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,775
There's always account

1149
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
You can

1150
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
Freelee

1151
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
But there'll be a time

1152
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
You can run

1153
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,463
You might have to like you're not going to go anyway

1154
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,863
Your car over a barricade or something to run and then a little bit

1155
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Beware of that

1156
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
Villain

1157
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
I guess

1158
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
Alright

1159
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,455
God we got to get rid of our morals are holding us back

1160
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
Oh well I'm okay with that

1161
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,295
So in this next clip

1162
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
I think

1163
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,135
Not positive but I think I've done a pretty good job

1164
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
And now I carry has some

1165
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,303
Talking a little bit more about the Sun

1166
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,631
Simon parkes also had information about this

1167
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,983
In addition my source and Simon parkes is sources

1168
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,799
And you can watch my interview with Simon parkes that

1169
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
Happened in

1170
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,871
Jalisco in September

1171
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,407
You want to get this straight

1172
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
You know the story straight from him

1173
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,039
As to what his sources were saying and what my sources were saying

1174
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
And how that

1175
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
Basically the Carrabba's

1176
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Corroborate the data

1177
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,695
That there was

1178
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
Also some ships close to the Sun

1179
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,351
We're being seen by the solar observatories there cameras

1180
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
That artwork

1181
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:34,495
Acting the frequency and or possibly according to mark

1182
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,311
Attempting to trigger what might be

1183
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,847
A solar event

1184
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
And this is also something that my source was

1185
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,479
Alluding to

1186
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Oh no

1187
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
Solar event

1188
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:52,927
Look at this look at it

1189
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
So when it went to solar events

1190
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
Quinceanera

1191
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,327
Quinceanera

1192
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
Set event

1193
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,887
Usually celebrated

1194
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,447
I don't know they're talking about

1195
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Trigger a masquerade

1196
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,479
Right that's right

1197
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Can harness the power of the sun 2

1198
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:24,671
Create a Coronavirus

1199
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:31,071
Destroyer or productive

1200
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,167
Look if you have the power to launch a nuclear weapon somebody

1201
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:40,543
You probably have the power to not launch a nuclear weapon but still do enough damage

1202
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Targeted way

1203
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,639
Instead of like a destroy the Earth

1204
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,271
That level of achievement it's sort of implied

1205
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,551
100-percent always

1206
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,855
But if you have

1207
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Reached

1208
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:00,255
Category of attack there's other things you have other options

1209
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:08,191
That level of the pyramid

1210
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,127
So

1211
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
She had Simon parkes coming

1212
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
More or less

1213
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,015
Confirming stuff that a secret source

1214
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Wink

1215
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Eyebrow waggle

1216
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,231
Confirmation

1217
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
She's like

1218
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
I've got

1219
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
Are you f****** Liars all on the same page

1220
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,703
So something is going on with the Sun

1221
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,495
You better believe it

1222
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,103
I think you can reach the conclusion there's definitely something going on with the Sun

1223
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,663
That they don't want us to see

1224
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:55,295
One of the things that they were trying to step down the frequency

1225
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,623
He actually said the good guys were trying to do this

1226
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:02,975
Because the Sun affect the Consciousness on planet Earth

1227
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:09,887
It is a rising too quickly apparently estimation and

1228
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,287
It's right

1229
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,127
And so they are trying to interfere with that

1230
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
Temporarily I'm told

1231
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
Sun is rising

1232
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Alright

1233
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
Hold On by Jordan

1234
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Good

1235
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
What

1236
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
What

1237
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,791
The sun is rising too frequently

1238
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,839
None of the frequency is rising

1239
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
Too quickly

1240
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
Because the frequency of the sun affects

1241
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,215
The consciousness of people on earth

1242
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
Which I guess is a

1243
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,567
Some sort of dumb space poetic way of discussing

1244
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,103
Seasonal affective

1245
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,527
The frequency with which you gets done

1246
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:04,927
No that's not what they're talkin about electromagnetic band

1247
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Frequency butt

1248
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,863
Who liked support life

1249
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887
Something along those lines

1250
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Fair

1251
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Come on

1252
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
What are you talking about

1253
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
Are you hurt

1254
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,647
Reaction

1255
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
Maybe there's factions

1256
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
Do you sure

1257
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Just trying to make some

1258
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,983
Remnants of

1259
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
Trying to make slime

1260
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
Of this

1261
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,847
Bulshit story about the

1262
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,199
The closing of the solar Observatory along with these webcam

1263
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Down

1264
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
Narrative

1265
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Which is what

1266
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
The business of doing

1267
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
Is what Mark Richards

1268
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Is thrilled to do

1269
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
24-karat

1270
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
With these Quest

1271
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,559
Karaoke

1272
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
Confused there are only

1273
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
2 ways to

1274
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,447
Which is either go to prison

1275
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,751
Because

1276
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:31,711
A lot of this stuff it like when you're confused by her hearing her stuff

1277
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
A lot of it stuff could

1278
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
Easily be

1279
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
Ironed out if you just

1280
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,999
We get to another little bit of a

1281
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
Bulshit story

1282
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:48,863
Carrie's been going on about for quite a while this is another one of her big

1283
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
Herbig go through

1284
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Spaceman

1285
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
Then unfortunately

1286
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Okay

1287
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:02,431
There is a relationship to the recently lost satellite and there were several

1288
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,015
That were lost that we lost our contact with

1289
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
They weren't

1290
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
You know

1291
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
They weren't demolished

1292
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,183
They were simply they went offline so to speak

1293
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,791
And there seemed to be a sort of war with the satellites going on in which

1294
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,863
Some satellites Wii game controller

1295
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,911
And some weight loss control up

1296
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,775
Related

1297
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,871
Do this shutting down

1298
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,199
That's somehow involved with the

1299
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Satellite

1300
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,807
Wow

1301
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,903
All right. We lost contact with multiple satellites

1302
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,183
Some sort of weird

1303
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,559
But the reality different

1304
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
The first instance

1305
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,935
I know the first instance

1306
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
That is Ventura

1307
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,055
Is what we covered back on the air

1308
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
There are strong indications that Russia

1309
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,871
The space program was engaging

1310
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,455
That they were maneuvering their satellites

1311
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
Restricted areas

1312
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,527
Drop on other countries.

1313
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,599
This is a piece of news closely matches up

1314
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
But the timeline

1315
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Conversation

1316
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
But interesting

1317
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,511
News

1318
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,303
I think might be misrepresenting

1319
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Firstly

1320
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
On April 28th

1321
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:30,495
India lost contact with one of their Satellites after something went wrong with the engines

1322
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,799
Meant to raise it to a higher orbit

1323
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
Most likely this is

1324
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
Result of something

1325
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,735
As it was the second satellite related failure since 2017 for the

1326
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Space Program

1327
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,831
Which by the way is Loki an awesome

1328
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,695
Space Program 2017

1329
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,511
The orbit from a single rocket with 104

1330
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
Pretty f****** cool set the world record India

1331
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,799
How high and eventually come back

1332
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
So there's that

1333
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
They also won the Indians

1334
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,783
In 2014 for a ridiculously cheap 73 million-dollar

1335
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,087
Compared to NASA

1336
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,647
671

1337
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
But them

1338
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:23,231
Wow Indian has a really great

1339
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,535
But they have

1340
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
Lost a couple

1341
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,007
Something about 104 in ones

1342
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
There's the

1343
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,103
Here's the name of the

1344
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
It's

1345
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
The acronym is

1346
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,551
The immature for to Aurora Global exploration

1347
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
Satellite

1348
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
T-shirt

1349
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,743
It's called image for short

1350
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
Image was launched in 2000

1351
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,607
Magnetics

1352
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
That quite well 45 years

1353
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Before NASA completely lost it

1354
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:09,567
They have no idea where it went until they tried their best they couldn't reestablish contact

1355
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
With this

1356
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,615
This image satellite

1357
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
A shout-out

1358
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Then

1359
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
In January 2018

1360
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,015
An amateur astronomer named

1361
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
Without looking

1362
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,831
Sky searching for other satellites

1363
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:24,671
But the transmission from image

1364
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,999
The satellite that have been missing for 13 years

1365
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:36,703
Now I assume by this place

1366
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,543
Like it became that dude friend and they started talking back and forth it was like

1367
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,871
I'm really lonely up here man

1368
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,967
Pixar's next movie

1369
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:52,831
NASA

1370
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,111
2005 quotes

1371
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:58,975
Solid State power controller which Powers the transponder

1372
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,023
It uses to communicate with ground can

1373
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:05,631
Filled with a sense of hope that maybe they could Salvage you win from the jaws of defeat

1374
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,935
NASA scientist course by Major Tom

1375
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,031
NASA scientist started trying to reconnect with image

1376
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,567
Collect data that it would have been

1377
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
Collecting

1378
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,919
Unfortunately though they were able to get Little Pigs back and forth

1379
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,735
Yeah you weren't able to get it 2X

1380
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
Respond to commands

1381
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
Appropriately because

1382
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
As usual

1383
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
Let's power controller

1384
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,999
He's what powers do much of the functionality of the spacecraft

1385
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
Grown Apart like it's tough

1386
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Forever

1387
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,263
It's so it unfortunately it ended up not working

1388
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,615
And at the end of August 2018 around the time that carry

1389
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,687
Eddie Maine

1390
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,015
They're barely receiving a signal at all from this image

1391
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,343
Satellite and they announced that it's probably lost

1392
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,439
Greg so we have a situation here where there's an actual satellite

1393
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,999
Was lost for 13 years

1394
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,559
That some guy was able to find

1395
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,631
And then they reestablished contact with

1396
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:16,031
But then went away it's possible that that's the story that they're basing a lot of this we lost contact with this satellite

1397
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
Not mentioning that we had lost contact with

1398
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,711
A 12 to 13 years before that

1399
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
That is but it had a programming in it

1400
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
He was going to go

1401
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:34,975
Eclipse was just going to automatically shut off while it was inside that eclipse

1402
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,767
How to predict whether or not it would

1403
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,887
Because they had lost contact with him but when it came out of that eclipse

1404
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
It turned out a dick

1405
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
Self back on

1406
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,495
So that's probably why Scott

1407
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
Rediscovery

1408
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,823
And nobody was looking

1409
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,223
That is so f****** fun it's amazing I love

1410
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,807
It's another great like mini-documentary like a 30

1411
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:05,183
4:30 but this guy accidentally rediscovering the satellite has been lost for over a decade

1412
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,255
Attorneys I mean far more explanation

1413
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,327
Before I'm willing to accept that this guy just like

1414
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
Email NASA was like

1415
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,263
Hey you guys been looking for a satellite I found it up the back of my truck from what I understand is he started to get rough

1416
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
Sort of

1417
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,615
Transmission

1418
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,431
From the satellite that he didn't quite understand

1419
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
I'm so he reached out

1420
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
Dakota

1421
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,719
The people who were working on it

1422
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,191
Satellite

1423
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:53,311
Also Jordan listen satellite

1424
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,383
Losing contact with satellite

1425
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
Credibly common

1426
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:04,831
This is disgusting

1427
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
Article you can look up

1428
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:11,487
It's surprisingly easy to lose a satellite worth millions

1429
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,167
Every year they're stories about a bunch of satellites

1430
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,471
Just lost contact with

1431
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
And not just the other countries

1432
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,847
Like I said earlier in the year India had that satellite the 2nd of

1433
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,407
Lost

1434
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
Russia lost contact

1435
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,991
A couple of satellites earlier this year

1436
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
Suez

1437
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
Satellites

1438
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,623
It does happen

1439
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:43,743
I don't want it like nobody wants

1440
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,303
NASA to come out in like an ounce every

1441
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
Satellite that they've lost

1442
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
Because then you're going to be like Wednesday so I can lose satellite all the time it'll be in space or the Smithsonian

1443
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,335
Explanation

1444
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:04,735
What happened second Rock misfired

1445
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
Interviewing the head of NASA

1446
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,087
How did you guys lose this million-dollar satellite

1447
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
F****** hard

1448
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,327
And this is

1449
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,887
Expensive because so much of the sunk cost

1450
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Exactly

1451
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
You just know sometimes is

1452
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:34,431
Level that you could never ever ever comprehend

1453
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,831
Who is on a level higher than we can comprehend and we can comprehend some

1454
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
Dude

1455
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,903
Completely uncontrolled

1456
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,975
So anyway is what happened

1457
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
With satellite

1458
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,535
I can find no evidence

1459
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
But that doesn't matter

1460
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:59,519
Inevitably wind up

1461
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
Something is rotten

1462
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:09,759
In space

1463
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,599
We did have the help of the pleiadian to help

1464
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,415
Give us the code to take the satellite back

1465
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,719
The ones we were able to take control of

1466
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,559
Is something that coincides with the Eddie

1467
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
Page information

1468
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:28,191
As well as Simon parkes information so we have three

1469
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,239
Confirming

1470
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,543
That information

1471
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
At this time

1472
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,895
Is Nazi a return of

1473
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:40,223
Biru he does not CS

1474
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,807
Upcoming invasion of Draco in the near future

1475
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,855
What's Cointreau to the predictions of

1476
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,535
So

1477
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
Ouch

1478
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,127
I'm going to figure out that quote one of these days

1479
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Trouble in Paradise

1480
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,319
America's Paradise Mark Richard

1481
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,623
Do not see eye-to-eye

1482
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,927
Mark Richards

1483
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Might

1484
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,311
But you know what I think that I look I say the n-word all the time

1485
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,943
Sprouts

1486
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,807
South suburbs of Chicago

1487
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Look

1488
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,951
Mark Richards is probably a little bit worried about his place as the

1489
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
Throne

1490
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,559
At the brown project

1491
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,351
That's not the only thing you have to

1492
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
What's he's got trouble

1493
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,823
He does say we're in a very bad position at this time too for a number of reasons

1494
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,639
A great deal and that his

1495
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:18,271
I don't know if it's his daughter his granddaughter and I wasn't unable to confirm which person

1496
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,575
But someone in his family was

1497
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,647
Recently diagnosed with a brain tumor

1498
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,439
Jewish families having a very hard

1499
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
Time right now

1500
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,535
I mean that sucks but don't try and pretend that someone messing

1501
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,887
She started presented as like someone gave this person the brain

1502
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
That's awful

1503
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
Himself

1504
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
Like that seems like only I'd be willing to

1505
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
You just brought it up

1506
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,503
In the vault

1507
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:53,855
Hey you made it let's cut let's cut out this whole bulshit for just a second

1508
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
And I want to make

1509
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
A real human

1510
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
My family is a

1511
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Experiencing

1512
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:05,631
My daughter has a brain injury

1513
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Open with Joanne

1514
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:13,055
Is it possible that Joanne gave her that information

1515
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
You know that Carrie has called

1516
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:20,992
And she has said is that her Bell's Palsy with a scalar

1517
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,320
Within her worldview

1518
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,088
Information

1519
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,184
He's created that narrative

1520
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,536
They're trying to attack me by giving my daughter or granddaughter

1521
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,840
First moment that I have ever thought

1522
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,632
It has an

1523
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
Yeah I didn't realize that either

1524
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,288
Right I didn't realize that he had reproduce

1525
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,336
I mean I guess

1526
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,384
He was out of prison

1527
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Like 20-something when he went

1528
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,200
Went to prison

1529
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:57,600
Also conjugal visits a good attitude while he's

1530
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,464
Conjugal visit

1531
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,816
Oh yeah actually when I was looking up the rules for visitation and stuff like that there's like

1532
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,960
Oh no that wasn't married

1533
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,520
Is even possible for a like you to have a family,

1534
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
For 48 hours

1535
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,848
And stay with you have like a holiday

1536
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
More like various holidays

1537
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
I don't know

1538
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:26,528
I don't know I don't know if that's true for prison

1539
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
But they do have a program where

1540
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,136
You get approval and everything

1541
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:35,744
Obviously not in yourself 48 hours

1542
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,768
You celebrate a holiday

1543
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,096
That's really good

1544
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,144
So much wrong

1545
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,032
So what's wrong but I like that I got.

1546
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:53,920
First thought is abolishment and then my next thought is

1547
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,480
I don't know

1548
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
How do you figure it out

1549
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:04,160
Don't need you my first thought is Legend

1550
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:04,928
After that is

1551
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Well if we do

1552
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
Do that then what do we do and

1553
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
If we do that then what else

1554
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,984
If you get off track

1555
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:23,616
Humane Pre-K

1556
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,408
Because it's so different for every different

1557
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,224
A person like what is valuable and what means

1558
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
You might not be the same as it may

1559
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,832
Tumi

1560
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
Environment for everybody

1561
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,928
What would be considered humane

1562
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
To you wouldn't probably be the same as

1563
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,256
Is 2 mi be a very

1564
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,792
Predilections and corks

1565
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
There are things that are super important

1566
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
Like for me

1567
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,192
I think it'd be awful to be a prisoner not be able to take a bath

1568
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
But yeah now that was kill you for 30 years

1569
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,288
Yeah

1570
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,080
Alone

1571
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
For 30 years

1572
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
Book

1573
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
I wouldn't be happy about it

1574
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,504
I obviously would probably be there if I did something to deserve

1575
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,648
I think you'll be inhumane baby shower that whole time I look at that incredibly difficult

1576
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
You probably would

1577
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
I wouldn't even

1578
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
Pop up

1579
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
I mean I would think about it

1580
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
Time to time but it wouldn't

1581
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:24,032
To what extent is prison isolation versus

1582
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,176
You know like you have a sec

1583
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
Like

1584
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
How is it that

1585
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,320
Infinitely better living situation

1586
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
Third time for weed possession

1587
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Can you know

1588
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,464
Also about Ender's brother

1589
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,072
No

1590
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,864
Has anybody caught him now

1591
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,912
Glenn Beck

1592
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,080
In the aftermath of the attack

1593
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,968
He referred to

1594
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,552
Victims of his attack at that camp as being like

1595
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Hitler Youth

1596
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,160
Because it was a political unit

1597
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
It was very

1598
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
Very disgraceful

1599
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,280
So hey there's an intersection without

1600
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
Alright

1601
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,376
Alright let's get back on track Jordan

1602
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:24,448
Accu back on

1603
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:29,824
Appears to be unimpressed with Eddie page

1604
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,176
Not a piece of s*** about the

1605
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:40,576
Draconian is racism on that tip tube

1606
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
But come on

1607
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,392
So he's on impressed

1608
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,160
Was that

1609
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:48,000
In the sex Club carry brings up another one of her

1610
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,816
Newer sources I guess

1611
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,424
I did talk to Mark briefly about scientific

1612
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,728
Paper that Paul Price Road

1613
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,920
Or he's going to have to mail me more

1614
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
Information

1615
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:13,344
Cuz we didn't have time to go into it in detail smartphones respond saying

1616
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
That it did not contain enough

1617
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,464
Specific equations in the formula was too General

1618
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,072
He did said say he would send me a better analysis villamil

1619
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
Ouch

1620
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:32,288
Mark Richards fired shots fired on this

1621
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
Cool

1622
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
He's probably

1623
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,272
Enough courtesy

1624
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
The world

1625
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,648
Through is a valid criticism

1626
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:54,048
Into everything that any of them have ever said but I like this is Carrie's met some new weirdos

1627
01:25:54,304 --> 01:26:00,448
Mark is not

1628
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,288
Retelling of real Liars

1629
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,616
Now that would be fun

1630
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
A place of light

1631
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
These guys

1632
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,712
Call Mike confidence

1633
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,992
Missile

1634
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,808
Yeah it's almost like a state

1635
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,832
Alpha Behavior

1636
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,624
Nmd like a pickup artist

1637
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
Bright

1638
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
Suck it

1639
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
To all your

1640
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:36,288
Real dad baby tell you about the warp drive

1641
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
Not enough

1642
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,736
Page Six

1643
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:51,648
He's got more information about your in a little bit

1644
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,184
Realized

1645
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,048
To the prison where she has met

1646
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,328
His roommate

1647
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,848
Analysis of this is like

1648
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
Soaking

1649
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,736
Okay she does have a cellmate at this time who is

1650
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:21,600
A relatively young man who has a scientific background parently

1651
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,160
And he is also very tall

1652
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
Cuz I saw him in person

1653
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
I wish I fall

1654
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:32,352
Sound very interesting

1655
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,544
I'm not sure I don't want to pee

1656
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,384
Course not

1657
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,408
Same time

1658
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,712
Being told

1659
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,528
He's an alien because he's

1660
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:53,088
Nope but here's the thing that I think she was trying

1661
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,648
Express but did so super poorly

1662
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,464
CID video scientific

1663
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
Check background

1664
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
He's Barrel

1665
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
I found that very interesting

1666
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Based on

1667
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,216
English pronoun reference is referring to the fact that he's tall

1668
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,496
Not the fact that

1669
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,080
The other thing that you mentioned earlier that is a scientific fact

1670
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:22,016
And then settings.

1671
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,296
And he's tall

1672
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,856
Humans don't do that

1673
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:29,440
Imprison his

1674
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,464
Pacific background

1675
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,256
I find that very interesting

1676
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:37,120
Also he's called expressions for being like

1677
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,192
She has a roommate in prison who has a scientific background

1678
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
He's tall

1679
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
Such a person

1680
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
Being his bunk mate is

1681
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,968
Interesting to me

1682
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:58,368
Who's 100 ways to express that you chose 31 along the way that makes it sound like the only thing I wanted

1683
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
I didn't

1684
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,536
Or something like that

1685
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:15,008
He has the sexual version of a Napoleon complex

1686
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
Napoleon

1687
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,592
You only goes with a squat

1688
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,408
I don't know I don't know the way she's expressing

1689
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Very

1690
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,480
Very confusing

1691
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
However

1692
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
She's doing it unless she's doing it the way that

1693
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
You saying she's doing

1694
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,904
She doesn't ever clarify at all

1695
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,696
That you just mentioned that

1696
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,280
He's warp-drive Converse All Star

1697
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
You got to do it

1698
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,376
We get one of those rare glimpses

1699
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
He's going to have to like

1700
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
Take them up to a higher level

1701
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,496
On the wall

1702
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,520
Private

1703
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
Stop

1704
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
Can't even reach

1705
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,152
The level

1706
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,432
To put those at eye level

1707
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,968
Here's what we're not talking about

1708
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,808
He's 84

1709
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:12,608
He's one of the Giants of the Old Testament

1710
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,960
Maybe is also the tallest human being ever recorded

1711
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,664
So this next clip Jordan

1712
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,200
Is one of those rare

1713
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
A couple of Clips was head event

1714
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
One of these days

1715
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
Kerry bringing up something

1716
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
About her space bulshit

1717
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
Branch of

1718
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
What is the rare bulshit

1719
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
In these

1720
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Mark Richard

1721
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936
Interviews

1722
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
That she does

1723
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,496
Where something is said

1724
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,776
Diddy's clearly

1725
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,544
Code

1726
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,592
They relate to all real world

1727
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,176
They're just talking about the real world but

1728
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Using a lie

1729
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Mike down for this Steve

1730
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
If you can

1731
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
The code

1732
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,856
I think I want you to scream right now

1733
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,184
Also talked about the Grays house

1734
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,792
Report to the highest bidder and that there is a

1735
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,864
A selling out many of the

1736
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,912
Journalist out there right now are

1737
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:25,568
Human hybrids and have been influenced by the greys and so they are obeying the Deep state

1738
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,616
And The Darkside

1739
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,736
Because they are basically kind of Solace and or

1740
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,040
Emotional

1741
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,600
Feeling so they don't connect with Humanity

1742
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
For you are you're a you're a push away from

1743
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,536
You're real close

1744
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,072
To this

1745
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,144
What we doing

1746
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,960
All the Press are grey aliens

1747
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
That's doing

1748
01:31:55,776 --> 01:32:00,128
Oh man we don't get a lot of news in here but I'll tell you right now

1749
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,688
Love it when Saudi Arabia murdered the journalist

1750
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Before that so

1751
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,160
Like 5 days

1752
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,976
Overweight

1753
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:17,280
Yeah I know but the the reports were

1754
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,072
Initially that he was missing

1755
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
Know their brother

1756
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:27,264
Okay I suppose that the reports were initially that he was missing

1757
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,896
If you recall if you recall on our first episode missing I was like

1758
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,456
Arabians murdered this guy

1759
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,016
It's not a conclusion

1760
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,832
Cuz they're all about murdering people that they don't

1761
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
Querida

1762
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,416
Caribou

1763
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,256
All journalists are grey aliens

1764
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,888
I mean it's just an old England

1765
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
Yeah buddy

1766
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
It's not like he hasn't

1767
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Intimate relation

1768
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,032
Breaking news service

1769
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:05,152
This is any more closer relationship with

1770
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,200
Good point

1771
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:13,600
You have brought up a pickup at I cannot ignore and imprisoned

1772
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,904
On the media

1773
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
If there's one thing I know about me enough

1774
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,000
The Free Press

1775
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,024
Top of the list

1776
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,072
I've been very like so long ago

1777
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:28,448
Dwight and no other voices are allowed to be very resistant

1778
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,496
Like talk about the idea

1779
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Possibly

1780
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
Falling in with

1781
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:38,176
You'll not be grabbing some stuff like that when I was looking into it

1782
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:42,272
Found that like a guy just texted organs missing

1783
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,552
Astoria like

1784
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,208
Prison

1785
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,256
Years or in that prison in other

1786
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,584
Wright has become acclimated

1787
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,960
Like we like to imagine

1788
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,288
He's just some sort of weird.

1789
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
Crazy

1790
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,872
That lives in prison

1791
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:14,016
I meant that are very generous

1792
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,552
Comes up with his

1793
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,368
Narrative bulshit

1794
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
Or whenever Carey

1795
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,672
Or someone else comes in

1796
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:25,024
We can tell them about it

1797
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,072
Incorporated with

1798
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,352
Some

1799
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,680
F****** bad dude

1800
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,776
We hear Carrie coming in and talk to him about the

1801
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,544
Media

1802
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
And he's a

1803
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Expressing

1804
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,872
It's all gravy alien

1805
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:45,760
They've all sold out they don't even have souls

1806
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,672
It's really tough to hear that and not think about other historical parallels I'm not going to

1807
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,464
I know every journalist

1808
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,744
Is a grey alien

1809
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,584
If you gave me like a roster in picture format of

1810
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,400
Let's call it journalist from

1811
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,984
Right and have all their pictures and kind of a situation

1812
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
I would be able to drop

1813
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,544
Bullseye's

1814
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,848
Over certain members

1815
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:17,248
Those organizations

1816
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,784
There might be like

1817
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,600
Single unifying thing that they might have in it

1818
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:25,952
It's cuz usually media but that's only because

1819
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,792
But all Jews are bad

1820
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:35,424
I mean to me when I hear that clip that is so clearly

1821
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
Adjust the David Icke

1822
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,056
Kind of thing

1823
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,336
Aliens

1824
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:45,664
What he's talking about

1825
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
Veterinary Clinic

1826
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,480
Is very

1827
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Clearly

1828
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Entrenched

1829
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
With MP7

1830
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
Now I don't know if that's Mark's whole bag

1831
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,904
But that's what he saying

1832
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
Find out why

1833
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
He does not believe

1834
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
80 Pages Mary

1835
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,840
It is a draco invasion

1836
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:04,864
Yeah

1837
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,704
He said the war on and off planet Earth is intensifying

1838
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Our allies

1839
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,056
Recently destroyed a moon of the

1840
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,480
Several races right now are given the Draco a very hard time in the Orion sector

1841
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,272
Galaxy

1842
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,064
If that were true that would

1843
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
Bestow

1844
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,672
Beetlejuice is one of the biggest stars in

1845
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
The Orion

1846
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
And it turns out that if

1847
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,864
That did go supernova and blow up

1848
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,656
Yeah it really wouldn't affect us.

1849
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,264
It's far far away enough that it wouldn't affect us

1850
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,104
Cuz I was thinking like okay they blow up this Moon we would f****** coz

1851
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,712
Johnny Carson

1852
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Consolation

1853
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,272
Like you know you never

1854
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,552
Usdan

1855
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,344
How many light-years away

1856
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,744
But I'll be able to see if they were giving them a hard time as we speak

1857
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:08,352
We would not know for another 15 to 20 hit read probably

1858
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,888
No like way longer

1859
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,936
Cute I would weep

1860
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:17,056
You and I would be dead so all of this implies that they have faster-than-light communication

1861
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
First

1862
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:30,880
It's taken as read

1863
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,416
No concept of this

1864
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,208
Until after you and I were long.

1865
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,024
Yeah it's alright 140

1866
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
3

1867
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,704
1360 light years away

1868
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,800
A lot of trouble right now and we're going to experience

1869
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:55,712
I'm going to take this one on the you're totally right you're totally right

1870
01:37:55,968 --> 01:38:02,112
Lightyear tracker

1871
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
For it to become

1872
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
Fine

1873
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,072
They may be blew up that dub I got it

1874
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,704
Of all the things that I decided to take a stand.

1875
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:23,104
This is one where I'm going to eat crow I'm going to eat crow on this we cannot confirm nor deny

1876
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,920
Blown up one of the Drano Max

1877
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:32,320
Enter Ian will know.

1878
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,856
Because he can remote view every

1879
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:38,464
You can go to revolt Riverview restaurant

1880
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Astral travel

1881
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,304
Who cares

1882
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,704
11

1883
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,008
Little bit more

1884
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:56,896
So in this next clip again we that we we have that last clip where

1885
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,040
Exactly the same thing of like

1886
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,320
Before you

1887
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
Journalist

1888
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,208
Kind of hear what you're talking about

1889
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,256
There's another

1890
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
Weird

1891
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,328
Thing where you talkin about the real world

1892
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,376
He said

1893
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,960
There's an interesting bit of information about

1894
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
Aliens who have been

1895
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:30,688
More or less given free rein in South America and Africa working now to expand their territory

1896
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,712
The other part

1897
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:34,016
And especially North America

1898
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:40,672
As they have eaten so many humans

1899
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,696
2

1900
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,256
Expand their hunting

1901
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,280
Is it called

1902
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,704
Alright alright come on come on hide it a little bit better than a little bit

1903
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,240
Better than that

1904
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
To hear that

1905
01:39:57,056 --> 01:40:00,384
Specific regions of

1906
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,944
Talking points about like immigrant

1907
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,992
Invasion in Southlake

1908
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:07,808
These aliens have been allowed to hunt

1909
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:13,440
Helium kill and eat all humans down there and now they want in on white territory

1910
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,512
To hear the exact same

1911
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,536
You hear out of Alex

1912
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Robinson

1913
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
Out of all the

1914
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
Canary right it's right there

1915
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,936
Give me a gist

1916
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
Give me

1917
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,752
Atlas say two examples

1918
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
14

1919
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
South Africa

1920
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,848
And one from South America

1921
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,688
Where the right-wing has very public talking

1922
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,992
About how white people are under

1923
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
Just give me

1924
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,040
Two examples

1925
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,832
I don't even need a lot then

1926
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
I'm sure there's no way

1927
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,416
You could find any examples

1928
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:47,488
One-to-one comparison

1929
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
Between right-wing talk

1930
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,328
Aliens that he is

1931
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,888
Describing here Dan this is a complete

1932
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,752
It's right

1933
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:03,104
He believes all of the alien narratives that he's

1934
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
Nothing it's just

1935
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,016
That would be crazy

1936
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:13,088
It would be crazy what's less crazy

1937
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
He has kind of

1938
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,416
Who's in prison

1939
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
Also a little

1940
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,512
Express himself

1941
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,328
Walkthrough little bit of Flowery narrative language

1942
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,144
Explain things

1943
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
How to say

1944
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Or any

1945
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,032
Any other slurs

1946
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
Show me

1947
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
Is there whatever it is

1948
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,992
Reptile

1949
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,624
I don't know how I feel about all that

1950
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:54,816
Not much just racism

1951
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,984
How's the weather for Saturday

1952
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,056
Conflicted about how to integrate that into the

1953
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,872
The bigger picture of a lot of stuff like it does become

1954
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,664
It becomes difficult to

1955
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
To look at

1956
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,224
The bigger picture of Mark Richard

1957
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
Quote-unquote philosophy

1958
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
And worldview

1959
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,880
We keep seeing little glimpses

1960
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,160
Right

1961
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:20,928
And it's not

1962
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
It's not super

1963
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,488
Covert but if you know the truth

1964
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,256
There there

1965
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,048
It does it does really

1966
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
Raise the question of

1967
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,120
How much of this

1968
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,424
Is part how much is

1969
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Do you know he's play

1970
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Bistro

1971
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:38,848
So that's the part that I'm conflicted this is a huge question that I cannot believe I have never asked you

1972
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,200
Mark Richards went to jail

1973
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,248
Story

1974
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
In 84

1975
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:46,784
Yeah

1976
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,552
Right

1977
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,368
There has to have been an interview with his

1978
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,488
Can you give me a comment

1979
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:56,768
Right

1980
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,048
He went to the trial

1981
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:04,448
Or maybe you did maybe just maybe

1982
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:08,032
First level comment that the Dutchman

1983
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,152
Truth chance

1984
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
I mean

1985
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:14,944
Uno's

1986
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,480
There also is a chance that he was mad

1987
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:23,136
Dad didn't know him we don't know I don't know enough about Mark Richards actual real life

1988
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,184
It is possible that he was

1989
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,488
Is that right

1990
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:32,864
For his story and working backwards chances are strong father figure

1991
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
Thoroughly

1992
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
Positive

1993
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:40,800
It's even possible that his dad was on the

1994
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
Open what-have-you

1995
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
Ivory

1996
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:51,040
News organization that wanted a comment

1997
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,672
If at that point years of

1998
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
Like a

1999
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,512
Deteriorating relationship between the two

2000
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,560
And things not going well then

2001
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
Murder

2002
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,608
You don't want to

2003
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,888
Play out in the news

2004
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
I tried to help him

2005
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
Yeah why

2006
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,520
You want to live your life especially not if you are part

2007
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,568
Absolutely

2008
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:20,224
There's a real world version

2009
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,504
Of his dad

2010
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
Would not appear

2011
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,880
Frigid frigid then there's also the

2012
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
The Dutchman

2013
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,952
Who also wouldn't appear in any text

2014
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,512
Showboat

2015
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,584
Both both no matter what the evidence to

2016
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,120
It could prove either

2017
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:37,888
So

2018
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
Fair enough

2019
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,984
So if it's like swept Jordan

2020
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,776
Bubba Bubba

2021
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:44,800
He hates Eddie

2022
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,640
But it turns out

2023
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
Are you done work yet

2024
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,224
It's not just

2025
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,248
80 Pages sayings

2026
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,784
Go invasion

2027
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,088
Turns out

2028
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
Empirical evidence is what you see

2029
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:05,024
Regarding Eddie page he made a special point after I left

2030
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:08,864
To contact me to let me know that

2031
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
She had

2032
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,984
Either he had or read that he's a very good remote viewer

2033
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,104
Took a look at any page or he got information about him

2034
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,664
He says that he is heavily programmed

2035
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:26,016
He also said that if we spent 10 minutes with him he could tell

2036
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,320
If he was truly ugly alien

2037
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,880
Mark was married to obsidian

2038
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,928
A lot of people don't know that

2039
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,280
But it is in the history of the interviews I've done with Mark in the past

2040
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,096
She can go back and look that up that is

2041
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:46,496
True back and look that up because I was like is married to that Rancho princess

2042
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:51,872
Turns out he was banging around with that Raptor princess he was married to

2043
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,688
So that that checks out

2044
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
Remember that one for some reason

2045
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,232
You got you guys could ferment your story

2046
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
Bridget

2047
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Oh my God this is

2048
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,704
What else is he lying about

2049
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,728
I'm going to go in

2050
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Everything

2051
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,080
He's been truthful about everything

2052
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:22,848
Except for

2053
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:25,152
The fact that there were real Raptors

2054
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,688
Dinosaurs

2055
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,504
And address

2056
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,832
6park

2057
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,136
Does Raptors

2058
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,488
Spielberg

2059
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
Perhaps better than the

2060
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,048
The real ones

2061
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:43,840

I found out all this

2066
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,360
I love the idea that

2067
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
Put me in a room

2068
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688

2077
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,704
Piece of my show in the future

Right

2082
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
That has to be the next

2083
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,200
As part of our consulting firm

2084
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:38,112
NFL run at this point you just got it

2085
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,160

Look it escalates

2088
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
The feud

2089
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,304
Escalated Feud

2090
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:52,704
What do you mean what do you mean are you we already know

2091
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
We already talked about this

2092
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,520
What is anorexia

2093
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,312
Your ass to become the devil

2094
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,592
He has to become like

2095
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:04,992
Yes absolutely Marcus right I am not who I pretend

2096
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:09,344
Interviewed

2097
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,928
Greatclips.com

2098
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,952
I have some

2099
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,976
Demonic information

2100
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
M4u

2101
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,072
Work

2102
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
There's no real

2103
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,168
No you're right

2104
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:23,936
Affirm

2105
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,008
Still based in the real world

2106
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:32,896
I forgot that we were hoping for situation

2107
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,664
Where

2108
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,432
Mark

2109
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:35,968
Would be on the same

2110
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
Ego-driven

2111
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,624
They each want

2112
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
To be Alphas

2113
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,160
Oh yeah

2114
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah I can't

2115
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:48,256
Each other

2116
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
Counterbalancing

2117
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,560
Eddie is

2118
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,608
Evil dark brother

2119
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,376
Mark Richards

2120
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
Degrees of him

2121
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:56,192
He is risen

2122
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,008
Use the noble one who is doing 30

2123
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,032
Years in prison

2124
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:03,360
And we'll be back for restless leg

2125
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
Because he is so good

2126
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:06,944
That sort of thing

2127
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Has committed so many crimes

2128
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,600
Sure

2129
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
Probably

2130
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,232
Skip this next week cuz it's just carry talkin about

2131
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:23,072
The devil

2132
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
Galaxy

2133
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:28,192
Very superficial normal not important

2134
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,264
And they always do what she's like

2135
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,288
She's on with the literal.

2136
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,360
Avista Corp Georgia

2137
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,176
We running to sort of issue

2138
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Where

2139
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:42,528
Here is the beginning of the episode of said that Mark is still a captain

2140
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,064
GM secrets

2141
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Should have gotten

2142
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,464
Yeah at least sergeant-at-arms

2143
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,792
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

2144
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,376
It's a difficult question to answer

2145
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
Astilbe

2146
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,680
Active member of

2147
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,984
Ambien prison

2148
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,544
But thankfully Carey

2149
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,872
Odyssey

2150
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:17,600
Mark is in a rather delicate position because even though he is

2151
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,368
Trusted

2152
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:22,208
A certain group of the secret space program

2153
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,048
He is very close to the Raptors and this

2154
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,888
Keeps him in sort of this gray area of Suspicion

2155
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:33,216
Simply because of his relationship and

2156
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:37,056
In a certain sense control of the Raptors

2157
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,872
Which makes him a real force to be reckoned with

2158
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:45,504
Who is the Raptors

2159
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,552
No I don't understand how that makes sense

2160
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,600
He controls the Raptors

2161
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:57,280
We didn't know that before this week you'd still controls the rapture

2162
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
Okay

2163
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Let's just play

2164
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,960
Like

2165
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,496
I would like you also

2166
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:10,336
Like start of the bottom

2167
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,896
Alright

2168
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
So

2169
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,200
Raptors

2170
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:21,600
We're still saying that the Raptors are good even though by association with Mark record Mark Richards

2171
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,184
That suggests that they are in fact that I'm at the reptoids are good

2172
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:29,536
If we

2173
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,840
Look at what 0%

2174
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,400
Mark and the Raptors are good

2175
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:40,800
So that's alright for now

2176
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
Princess

2177
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:46,432
I think so

2178
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:52,832
Series

2179
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,368
You're f****** alien

2180
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:04,096
It's standard operating procedure allegiances

2181
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,888
Alien

2182
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,192
All the sudden you guys were

2183
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:13,312
So now he exists in some parts of the secret

2184
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,336
Space Program

2185
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,640
Except that this man is trustworthy

2186
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:23,040
We can believe in him but other parts of the secret space program

2187
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
Earlier with

2188
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,624
From the last 30 years he's been

2189
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,160
Prison baby

2190
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:34,560
Terminated by the Demonic forces within the thirty-year-old guy

2191
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,352
Richard

2192
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:40,704
And then you're going to tell me that Mark Richards controls the

2193
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:45,056
Building up for f****** chocolate

2194
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:47,616
Wicked pictures of the good guys

2195
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,152
So you're telling me

2196
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,688
The even though

2197
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,320
Who Now controls

2198
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:02,720
We doubt he does controller everything every single time

2199
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,280
Raptor eats chocolate

2200
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,816
That's what they consent

2201
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:10,912
It's a demonstration of failure at leader

2202
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:17,312
What if

2203
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:23,200
He ordered the hit it could be the kinky Boys in line

2204
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:26,016
He's got a very Lacks

2205
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:30,368
It's like it's like he's Erik Prince he's the Erik Prince of the Raptors

2206
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,000
Not good intelligent commit war crimes

2207
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
Baby

2208
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,048
We're going to be fine

2209
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,096
It's interesting because

2210
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:42,656
I have sort of a mercenary space situation

2211
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:43,936
To talk

2212
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,984
I'm going to go with Mark Richards

2213
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,520
Has abandoned

2214
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:51,360
Addison said going into private

2215
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,152
Private Contracting

2216
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,200
Much like a brisket

2217
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:55,968
Using his

2218
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,992
Relationship

2219
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,528
With the Raptors

2220
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,624
He's back up and that's the only thing

2221
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,904
Bring him from

2222
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:09,536
The hypothetical threat of referee

2223
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
I ran into

2224
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,192
Wife

2225
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960

2226
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,544
Have fun

2227
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,824
Have fun buddy

2228
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
You

2229
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,360
Far

2230
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:30,784
Wherever is not harsh

2231
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
Terminator

2232
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
Yeah man it's weird it's

2233
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
Super 8

2234
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024
Terms of like

2235
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,072
Universal politics

2236
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:45,120
Park Record

2237
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,656
Controls the Raptor

2238
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,192
And that's why

2239
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:52,288
Is here on Earth does he control Raptors

2240
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,128
Program has like a like a

2241
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Restraint

2242
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,456
Respect

2243
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,272
Because this other alien race

2244
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,832
He's on board of them to in

2245
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
Buc-ee's

2246
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:08,928
He controls all of them

2247
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,208
Much like

2248
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:15,072
I don't know did relationship he has with them is

2249
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
Is similar to

2250
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,704
Star Wars parallel

2251
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,288
Now I'm the only one

2252
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,080
Techui you're like that

2253
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,872
It's not

2254
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,920
Eventually

2255
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
I don't like those move

2256
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,736
Dario

2257
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,832
Everybody can

2258
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,368
Not everybody can

2259
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,000
C-3PO Campbell

2260
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:53,216
Yeah that is spelled

2261
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
Correct that I apologize

2262
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
It was

2263
01:55:56,544 --> 01:56:01,664
Never made it clear what she was trying to say I want subtitles

2264
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,992
How about you go to Kashyyyk

2265
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,272
I'm learning the language

2266
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,296
Dance

2267
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,880
In this next clip Carrie has

2268
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:16,256
Yeah and that is like

2269
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,168
The answer is no

2270
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:29,056
I asked him if the generals around Trump know who Mark is and if they are red in

2271
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:31,616
And he said some are some aren't

2272
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,920
He said General Dunford

2273
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,712
The chairman of the joint

2274
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:40,064
Is in the know and by the way Simon parkes also referred

2275
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,088
The General

2276
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:44,672
Saying that he was instrumental in

2277
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,256
Backing up and

2278
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,048
And making

2279
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,840
Trump's Administration possible

2280
01:56:54,656 --> 01:57:00,800
Some of the generals around Trump really don't know anything about the secret spot coffee and they don't know who

2281
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:04,640
I said tomorrow

2282
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
And Mark

2283
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,200
Krispy Kreme

2284
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,368
You know what

2285
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,952
I'm going to go back to

2286
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,488
Don't agree

2287
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:25,888
Say that you don't know

2288
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:32,288
Cover Under Wraps if all of the generals know about

2289
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:41,504
Exactly if you only want the guys were empowered

2290
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,624
And Joseph

2291
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:51,744
Necessarily know if this is a thing that reflects negatively on me

2292
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,304
Leon the world we live in

2293
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,632
He's still the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

2294
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
Okay

2295
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:04,032
You can understand why why you not because

2296
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,824
How many different

2297
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,432
Chiefs of Staff

2298
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,504
Like it's it's reasonable to not be sure

2299
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,320
If you know anybody in a cabinet-level

2300
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:19,136
Yeah yeah for sure he's been

2301
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,672
As long as

2302
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,720
We've been talked about people who reference

2303
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
The entire time

2304
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,656
Doing this podcast

2305
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,192
But every time

2306
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:35,008
Chief of Staff has come up

2307
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,288
He is been

2308
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,312
And

2309
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,152
Is even in my memory

2310
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,688
There was that time that

2311
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,968
Alex

2312
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:48,320
Come up with John

2313
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:52,928
That's why I haven't come up with the name

2314
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:54,976
Well

2315
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,768
Am I even

2316
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:02,144
That can't even come up with me

2317
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,168
Greatest prop

2318
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,704
Annette like toolbox

2319
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,776
Basically

2320
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,056
Is thankfully Terry

2321
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,360
Sodas

2322
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:14,176
Mark. OK Google

2323
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,200
Bang

2324
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,992
You can find Dunford on Bang

2325

How to tame a c

2326
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,976
Clips

2327
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,840
Alright

2328
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,608
We have

2329
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,656
We disagree with

2330
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:35,936
Science

2331
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Evidence

2332
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,008
Those sorts of

2333
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,288
Tell me those things

2334
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,080
Though we can only know

2335
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,640
Roughly 100 to 1000

2336
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,712
Yes

2337
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:50,272
But the rest of this kind of like asses bulshit

2338
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,344
At this point

2339
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,624
Kind of tickets

2340
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,160
Into a situation where

2341
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,696
Now the narratives

2342
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,976
Just going to be this like

2343
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,512
I don't even know

2344
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,304
This

2345
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,328
I know that

2346
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
It's what Mark is

2347
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,120
Telling you

2348
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
But

2349
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:10,496
Regarding Elon Musk she's been a daughter

2350
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:13,568
Recently as you may know and

2351
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,848
Apparently

2352
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:16,640
Mark Zuckerberg

2353
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,736
The rocket deals

2354
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,576
That

2355
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,184
The rocket deals that were part of Elon Musk

2356
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
Stop

2357
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
That's not great

2358
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,536
What

2359
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,328
Is that how that works

2360
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:41,216
Mark Zuckerberg now that Elon Musk has been indicted by the SEC and Tesla still exist

2361
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:48,384
Now that he's on work has been indicted Mark Zuckerberg who has not a rocket company to his name

2362
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:55,296
You now get to the rocket deals that were apart of Elon Musk

2363
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,344
Stuff

2364
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,624
All right you are

2365
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,928
You create a company

2366
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,976
Built on

2367
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,768
Perhaps the Sham idea

2368
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:11,168
Futuristic technology

2369
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:17,568
You haven't been doing your heart

2370
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:21,152
Now

2371
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,688
At the most

2372
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,992
A slap-on-the-wrist we can't do this

2373
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:31,392
Bridgeview anymore

2374
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,184
Fraud

2375
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:39,584
Lost a lot of people a lot of money

2376
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,424
That's a crime in the world that we live in that's a crime

2377
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:46,752
It's a real shity thing however in the world we live in also

2378
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
You're rich

2379
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:49,568
So nobody's going to bother you

2380
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,872
But we can't trust you with these Rockets

2381
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:55,712
Does rockets go to Mark Zuckerberg

2382
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,760
He's working to give these Rockets

2383
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:03,648
The guy from The Social Network by Aaron Sorkin

2384
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:07,232
A real fictional movie

2385
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,536
I'm going to need you cuz I'm slightly fix

2386
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:15,680
Dialogue look I love everybody masturbating to his liberal bulshit dialog but

2387
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:20,544
I'm going to be honest with you doesn't sound like the way real people talk

2388
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,592
Conspiracy

2389
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,432
Version of Mark Zuckerberg

2390
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,224
Rockets

2391
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,528
Set versus not involve rocket

2392
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,600
Infrastructure that is

2393
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:36,416
Required

2394
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:39,488
What do you mean are you saying that the Facebook campus is Art building rock

2395
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,512
No

2396
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,840
For business what Mark Zuckerberg is

2397
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
Feeling

2398
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,400
Information installing it

2399
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,424
To the highest bidder

2400
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,216
That is not the same business

2401
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:49,984
That is it

2402
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,520
Involved with actual

2403
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,544
Like

2404
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,568
To build a rocket

2405
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,384
It stopped you need a lot of different departments

2406
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,152
You need

2407
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:58,688
A lot of specialized

2408
02:02:59,200 --> 02:02:59,712
Scientist

2409
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:01,760
He's not in my bed

02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,088
Mark Richard

He's out of the

2416
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,912
Picture which is not

2417
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:20,448

Irregardless of how you made your money you are also Scorpios evil Superman

2422
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
I also like the idea of

2423
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,304
No matter what

2424
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,096
If you're one of these people that were taught

2425
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:48,864
To be afraid of

2426
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,424
These these figureheads of businesses

2427
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
You are

2428
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:58,848

You know how to build a rocket

2435
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,120
That's science

2436
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,472
Science magazine

2437
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:27,264
That's about science

2438
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
That's crazy

2439
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,152
You really said that

2440
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:37,248
You really said that Elon Musk because he was indicted

2441
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,088
All of his contract now went to Zuckerberg

2442
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,112
Is Rocky

2443
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
And then let's hear the end of this road

2444
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:49,792
Bears hearing

2445
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,096
Heaters out

2446
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:59,520
The rocket deals that were part of Elon Musk

2447
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:09,504
Couldn't even come up with portfolio

2448
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,320
Better than

2449
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,112
You know it's just

2450
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,904
Zuckerberg gets his stuff

2451
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:22,304
I wish I could

2452
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,120
Chicago voices

2453
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,288
We all know

2454
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,056
That

2455
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,080
Marc rich

2456
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
Remote view that ipe

2457
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:39,200
Right and that he could smell

2458
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,224
Pleiadian

2459
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,552
If you be able to tell for sure

2460
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,320
Kind of races

2461
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,136
Now youse married

2462
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:50,208
Which is also

2463
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:04,800
Basically we get this

2464
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:07,104
Mark is trying to

2465
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,408
Really invalidating page

2466
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,480
Through like

2467
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,064
He's using language

2468
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:16,832
Which is sort of like

2469
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,184
He's trying

2470
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,720
Do an if Aven

2471
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,256
Beavan see

2472
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,560
Is really picking up on the Scylla

2473
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:31,936
Sad because he was married to pleiadian he knows quite a bit about them

2474
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,216
Does not believe

2475
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,264
Play Dance can be mine Patrol

2476
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,080
Eddie's Casey said

2477
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:41,408
She thought they could be mine control if they allow it

2478
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:48,576
Okay when does wonder why athlean would allow themselves to be mind-controlled by humans

2479
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:51,136
Does opened

2480
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:53,696
The question as to which races are

2481
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,024
Does does open

2482
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:59,840
The only possibilities are what

2483
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
Exactly

2484
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,912
That Eddie page is a

2485
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,704
He is chosen

2486
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,008
To become brain what's going undercover

2487
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,032
Probably

2488
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,080
He's lying about

2489
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:10,848
Pleiadian

2490
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,872
Because he is mine

2491
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,152
That's established

2492
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Used

2493
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:16,736
He is my control

2494
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:23,904
If that's only corroborating evidence

2495
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:24,928
He is mine

2496
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:27,744
So we have both

2497
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,512
Avenues

2498
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,608
And both are Eddie page

2499
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,400
Suspect

2500
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:36,192
I don't trust

2501
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
Britches

2502
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:37,984
Obviously

2503
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,008
Super 8

2504
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:39,776
Advantageous

2505
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:40,800
Because like

2506
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,568
I'm protecting my

2507
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,872
It's also super

2508
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,152
Sports

2509
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,688
Because

2510
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
Page

2511
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:48,992
He's become too much

2512
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:53,600
I would much

2513
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:57,440
I would much rather have my

2514
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,976
Narrative with

2515
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,536
The greatest whistleblower in the world who's in prison

2516
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:04,352
That I can completely control the narrative

2517
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
I can just

2518
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:10,240
Whitewashing

2519
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:14,848
It's so close

2520
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,224
The two peoples

2521
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,992
Pinterest

2522
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:23,552
Better best Servite invalidating

2523
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,344
Are Kerry Cassidy

2524
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:30,976
Mark Richards could have expedited this visit

2525
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:35,072
This secondary

2526
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,608
He started to smell bad

2527
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,424
You could have done that

2528
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,472
Like this siren

2529
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:42,496
Yeah

2530
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,800
You hear someone saying that they're an alien

2531
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,736
So in this next clip because you

2532
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:53,504
He was married to

2533
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:55,808
Right Mark Richard

2534
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:56,832
Heisman watch

2535
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,416
Tell who is Apple

2536
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,440
His dick

2537
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,720
Summerville

2538
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:04,512
Very reminiscent

2539
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,304
Other care

2540
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,936
Did Mark did say that helps you tell

2541
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:14,496
Creating is that they don't like to look

2542
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:16,288
You directly in the eyes

2543
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:18,848
They have trouble responding

2544
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,128
Two everyday chat with

2545
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,152
Appropriate

2546
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:25,504
Micro expressions and they tend to copy or imitate are micros

2547
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,808
Expressions during conversation

2548
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:30,112
Consciously

2549
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
Any used an example

2550
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,464
That humans lick their lips

2551
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,256
Involuntarily

2552
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:40,352
Even during the conversation or something but that's something that

2553
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
And that

2554
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,704
Adopt

2555
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,984
That behavior

2556
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,800
Purposely and so it would look quite odd

2557
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:54,944
And so this kind of visiting a giveaway giveaway on

2558
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:03,392
I mean I guess that's better than where I thought it was going like they're probably

2559
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:06,208
You can never trust anybody on the artistic

2560
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:06,976
Spectrum

2561
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,536
As opposed to where I thought he was going which is like

2562
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,584
They

2563
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:18,752
Swim and they like watermelon and fried chicken like I would have been better off know you better off thinking I don't know why

2564
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,128
Good

2565
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:24,896
Okay

2566
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:27,456
He's not saying anything negative about the

2567
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:29,248
Weird

2568
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:37,440
Characterization

2569
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
Asperger's Spectrum

2570
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,256
The autism

2571
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:43,584
People were reversed

2572
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,864
Do I contact

2573
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,888
Social cues

2574
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,912
Jews being

2575
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,216
Misunderstood

2576
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,008
What he's described

2577
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,384
I think he read an article on on that sort of thing

2578
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:00,736
Pretty good about

2579
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:01,760
Because the

2580
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:02,528
The Palladium

2581
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,832
In that world

2582
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
To the fact that

2583
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,136
It's not like taking

2584
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:08,672
Neuro

2585
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
Group

2586
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,048
He's there

2587
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:14,816
To tell

2588
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:15,584
Who are the

2589
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,984
The good Among Us I mean at the same time though.

2590
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:29,664
That that gets into the end of The Stereotype game

2591
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:39,136
Racist towards Asian people

2592
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,416
No

2593
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:47,328
You are a great you're pressing it as a positive connotation but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not being

2594
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,096
A complete

2595
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,680
Like he's he's definitely like

2596
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,032
This movie

2597
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:58,080
And I'm going to tell you right

2598
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
He

2599
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:00,896
This guy this

2600
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:01,664
Pleiadian

2601
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,456
He kept saying

2602
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:04,736
Is crazy

2603
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,016
Like

2604
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,808
You're right it is like

2605
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,624
But for the bar that we

2606
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:19,072
It's better than the other

2607
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:19,840
Yeah yeah

2608
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:24,960
Autism

2609
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:27,776
And applied

2610
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:28,800
Get to a negative

2611
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:29,824
Evil alien

2612
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,176
It's not great

2613
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,712
But

2614
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,480
We got a wreck

2615
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,248
Recognized

2616
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,040
Justin

2617
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,856
I'm not a fan of

Workout through

2625
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:56,448
Interviews

Pure Express

The Raptors

2630
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:07,200
Kill people

2631
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,784
Has been brought up by Carrie and Mark

2632
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,416
I think that you're foolish

2633
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:19,232
You think that is

2634
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,512
Not to trust

2635
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:21,792
Is it

2636
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:22,560
If explained

2637
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:29,728
One thing he said was an interesting comment he said the Raptors mantid played in

2638
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:33,568
Ionians are loyal to us just like in WWII

2639
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848
Sure

2640
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:39,456
And he says that we're allies especially in deep space of really stepped up

2641
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,736
I'm taking up the fight

2642
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:41,504
Draco

2643
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:46,112
And he has never been double-crossed by a Raptor

2644
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
And

2645
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:53,536
Even she used to be suspicious of them because they used to eat people but now he feels they're totally

2646
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:56,096
So calm down

2647
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,376
They used to eat

2648
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,912
Mark Richards

2649
02:13:59,424 --> 02:13:59,936
She wasn't

2650
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,240
Grown

2651
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,776
Through it and now it's Jordan

2652
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:05,568
Jordanelle

2653
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:07,616
Headshave

2654
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:10,944
No back in the Pathmark Richards was just like

2655
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:12,224
He heard

2656
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,040
And he was like

2657
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:17,344
No not cool not cool

2658
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
But he's

2659
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,392
Track record

2660
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:20,928
They've their loyal

2661
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,720
Just like in World War II

2662
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,256
Yeah they got our back

2663
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:25,280
Raptors

2664
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:27,584
Now they

2665
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,888
Admittedly eight people for chocolate

2666
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,472
We all have a lot of straw

2667
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:37,056
We won

2668
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:39,872
At one of them is

2669
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:40,896
Miami

2670
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:44,480
Of course

2671
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,112
Super contagious

2672
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,648
Free to be like look I know that

2673
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:54,208
Spanx

2674
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,512
Just blew up a

2675
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:57,536
Draco

2676
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:05,472
Hey are you going to sneeze on that we never would have stopped Napoleon if the Russians hadn't had a lot of land

2677
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:07,008
Or World War

2678
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,080
Yeah we never would have stopped to Hitler The Rush

2679
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,616
Had a lot of

2680
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:19,040
I don't know

2681
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,832
Entering

2682
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,368
What I will say is

2683
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:23,648
That the new

2684
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:24,672
Mark Richard

2685
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:27,232
Game

2686
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:29,792
Quite frankly project

2687
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:31,584
I know

2688
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,400
Did every single time you do an episode

2689
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,936
There will be

2690
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,728
Race of alien

2691
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:41,824
That comes up

2692
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,640
I like this game

2693
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:47,200
Will introduce

2694
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:50,784
To come in

2695
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:53,088
What do you

2696
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:57,184
You think that racism

2697
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,720
I will tell you

2698
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:00,512
Did I will answer 5 questions

2699
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:04,608
You cannot make a guess

2700
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:07,424
Before you ask those five questions

2701
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:10,240
Is it a mammalian species

2702
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:11,520
Alright

2703
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,056
Is it a repeat

2704
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,616
I actually can't say

2705
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:20,992
You can ask you can ask me any question

2706
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,528
That's not one of your foot alright

2707
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,320
It is considered

2708
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,600
Reptilian species

2709
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,648
But the name would not leave

2710
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,672
You think that it is

2711
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:32,768
The name is not a reptile

2712
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:39,168
But the people as reptilian using graders that you have ever said

2713
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:39,936
Alright

2714
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:44,288
What sector

2715
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:46,848
Space

2716
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,640
Not clear

2717
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:52,992
That is even if I answered that it would.

2718
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:56,832
Okay, three

2719
02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:02,208
Alright you need to really just start asking questions

2720
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:05,280
Are they

2721
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,048
Evil

2722
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:11,680
Number three

2723
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,496
Non-mammalian

2724
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:17,568
Reptilian species that you mix

2725
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:23,712
To be reptilians is not reptilia

2726
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,528
Alright so we got that established

2727
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:32,928
Narrow is a what

2728
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:41,120
I honestly don't know the answer

2729
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:43,424
The question but I will say based on.

2730
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,216
The name no

2731
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:49,824
Okay?

2732
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,664
You should have

2733
02:17:54,688 --> 02:18:00,320
Different question obviously that's why we aren't doing yourself

2734
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:04,928
Last question Georgia

2735
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:09,280
That you would not immediately assume as reptilian based upon their name

2736
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,448
Certain

2737
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,216
Continents

2738
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:19,776
And if so what kind

2739
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,824
If further so

2740
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:28,480
Is that an island continent that could be explained away as evolutionary

2741
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:32,832
Is a three-part question that I get away

2742
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:33,856
How can I help you

2743
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:40,256
Alright I'm going to go with

2744
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:41,792
Campy dragons

2745
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,072
Something to go with Salomon

2746
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:47,680
So I also ask Mark about the Dragon

2747
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:52,288
Because I wondered if they were attacking the Draco as well

2748
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:56,384
Reptilian

2749
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,920
Corso

2750
02:18:58,176 --> 02:19:01,760
It's interesting you want more about the dragon moth

2751
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:07,648
Ashiana Dean Voyager books go into this race as well as others

2752
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:10,208
Highly recommended

2753
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:16,096
Are they and Mark is aware of the Dragon moth said he did not know what their involvement is

2754
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:27,872
He knows that they're in play but he doesn't know what they're up to

2755
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:30,688
He said I know about them I don't feel like they're part of this

2756
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,224
It's pretty crazy that you were like

2757
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,760
You did say drag

2758
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,784
Being right before like

2759
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:39,136
The dragon moth

2760
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:44,256
Also that was a very misleading answer

2761
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:51,168
He's everything a reptilian species that

2762
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:52,960
I didn't I play the tape back

2763
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,544
They are considered

2764
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,592
To be a reptilian species

2765
02:19:58,848 --> 02:19:59,616
Space

2766
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:00,384
Research

2767
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,176
Looking into it

2768
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:08,576
Dragon boss is not a reptile

2769
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:16,000
Like if you are at now that makes sense

2770
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,560
Cuz if you ever

2771
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:21,888
It is

2772
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:25,728
Confusion is venmo

2773
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,288
My creation

2774
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,824
Dean book

2775
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,872
The Voyager books I looked into

2776
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:33,152
These books

2777
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:39,040
A little fun fact

2778
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,832
You can buy

2779
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:41,856
Copy of

2780
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:42,624
The paperback

2781
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,416
Check for $75

2782
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,256
On Amazon

2783
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:50,816
Must be great

2784
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:54,912
I've been in print

2785
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:58,496
So many people on them

2786
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:03,872
Dragon Ball

2787
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,528
Fairy Mothra Style

2788
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:12,832
Is that actually

2789
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:14,112
Tickled me so much

2790
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:15,648
Hey it's like

2791
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,184
Gary gygax

2792
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:23,328
There's a Hooter lien

2793
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,608
He's a reptilian

2794
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,632
The boots

2795
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:30,496
Well that's that teams at the at the very least that's Direct

2796
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:32,032
There's also blue

2797
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,080
Just blue people

2798
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:35,872
Cutelaba

2799
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:40,736
It Came Upon whatever

2800
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:43,296
Bingo

2801
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:49,696
The Appalachian

2802
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:53,536
Literally like

2803
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:56,096
I like the Third Reich

2804
02:21:58,144 --> 02:22:01,216
We got reptilian a tractor

2805
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:05,568
We got Dragon bolts now

2806
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:07,616
This world bugs

2807
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:08,640
Is just

2808
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:11,200
Increasing it's not it's never not bug

2809
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:14,016
I don't always understand

2810
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:19,648
Ants aren't number one on the alien species

2811
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:24,000
I feel like they're in there though when you talked to like Halo worth

2812
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:25,536
Definitely talk about

2813
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:30,912
Makes more sense to me than any of this other

2814
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,960
If there was a hollow Earth

2815
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:35,264
I would assume

2816
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:38,336
Of course they did a lot

2817
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:44,992
Congratulations

2818
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:48,576
Dragon moth you are now part of our

02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:56,256
I should tell you that

2824
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:57,280
Cassidy

2825
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
Episode

2826
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,608
In this next

2827
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:03,936
Keenly aware

2828
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,704
How much

2829
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,728
Probably miss

2830
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:07,520
The things

2831
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,544
Mark Richards

2832
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:09,824
And

2833
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,408
Fixing something

2834
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:14,944
You should never have said

2835
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:20,832
That what I'm doing with Mark is trading info and in some ways it's a lot like

2836
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:24,160
The sort of all the presidents men

2837
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,696
Throat

2838
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:29,792
Where you basically you say something

2839
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:34,144
And if she nods or he says nothing is mean

2840
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,168
You're right

2841
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:37,216
But

2842
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,640
Information

2843
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:48,224
I guess Eva more sensitive nature

2844
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:53,600
And I am sharing a lot of background information with him

2845
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:57,440
Be in our sort of when I ask ask a question

2846
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:59,232
Sure he understands

2847
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,024
Where I'm coming from

2848
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:05,376
Tell him to give me the answer.

2849
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:10,240
Dynamic flowers in general

2850
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:15,104
No it's if you show that you know certain amount

2851
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:20,992
Will come and meet you halfway

2852
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,528
Then you won't learn anything

2853
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,832
No Kevin

2854
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:28,160
Sort of an interesting Dynamic I wanted to make people aware of

2855
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:30,208
If you come in

2856
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:33,536
It's really not if you are talking to a con man

2857
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:36,864
And you come and meet them halfway

2858
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,680
They will use all of the information

2859
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:40,448
Presented

2860
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:50,432
Call delivery blow

2861
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,016
The first thing you do is you let the whistle

2862
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:56,064
Baked all the noises that it needs

2863
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,880
To make first

2864
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:03,744
Almost as if you communicate with the whistle

2865
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:09,632
Yeah I'm here

2866
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:10,656
What Cheese's

2867
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:13,472
First of all

2868
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:14,752
Richie's talking about like

2869
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,824
Let me just say

2870
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:21,664
Of all of the podcast that we

2871
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,736
I think that might be

2872
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:25,760
In the running

2873
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,552
It's damn for the dumbest

2874
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:29,088
Any human being

2875
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:29,856
Has ever said

2876
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:32,928
Cuts her entire fluffy

2877
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:39,328
Entire life's work ability to understand

2878
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:43,424
Eid

2879
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,704
I talked

2880
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,520
To Mark and sometimes he doesn't respond

2881
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,568
And then I take that to mean

2882
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:50,592
That I'm right

2883
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,896
That's a flawed

2884
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:55,200
How do you know good

2885
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:56,480
Real good

2886
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:58,528
Well I'm not saying

2887
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:03,648
Jordan 11 comparison

2888
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,304
What do you think is going on with Saudi Arabia

2889
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:13,888
Do you think that is

2890
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,424
Some kind of a

2891
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:18,752
Power grab by a ruler that

2892
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:21,568
Hey is unwilling to accept any kind of criticism

2893
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:26,176
Alright do you think that maybe

2894
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,968
What's going on is

2895
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:32,064
Ruler who is willing to accept

2896
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,880
Decided to overreaches power because

2897
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:38,464
Really he was kind of just wanted to test how far is power

2898
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,792
Can you do something

2899
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,328
Publicly egregious

2900
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:45,632
On the world stage and still get away with it

2901
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,704
Okay

2902
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:50,752
I get what you say

2903
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:58,688
This is evidence that I know about this and I don't want to talk about it

2904
02:26:58,944 --> 02:26:59,456
That sort of

2905
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:01,248
Level of of reason

2906
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:08,672
The dumbest thing I think we've ever

2907
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:11,488
You can't you can't live

2908
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,096

3010
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,352
Throughout Oliver

3011
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,008
Is weird

3012
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,032
Thing for me to say

3013
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:10,336
4

3014
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:11,360
Mark

3015
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,384
Carrie's relay

3016
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,664
I feel like Mark

3017
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:14,432
Kaiser Realty

3018
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:21,088
Creator and I mean if you want to talk about

3019
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:27,744
March

3020
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,512
Foreman

3021
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:32,864
Mark Hart

3022
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:44,128
Just can't afford that s***

3023
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:46,688
Jordan

3024
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:47,712
At this point

3025
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:48,992
Think we get

3026
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:50,528
What's going on

3027
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:58,720
Yes I am

3028
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:00,512
Once again once again

3029
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:01,792
We are dealing with

3030
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:02,560
Two person

3031
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:03,584
Who is the

3032
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:05,376
The propaganda

3033
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:08,704
Carrie is doing this

3034
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:10,496
Because she tried

3035
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:11,520
Record it

3036
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:12,288
No

3037
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,312
She tried to

3038
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,360
Defiled disappear

3039
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,176
She thinks that's some sort of

3040
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:18,944
Nefarious

3041
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:19,712
Interference

3042
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:22,784
Whatever

3043
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:26,624
Computer has Bell's palsy

3044
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:29,440
Who cares

3045
02:32:29,696 --> 02:32:31,488
We've lost in episode

3046
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:34,304
So because she's

3047
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,864
There are a bunch of people in the Stream

3048
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,656
And she gets one

3049
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:40,192
But I think is the most

3050
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:41,984
That is ever been

3051
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:43,520
On

3052
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:44,800
Project Camelot

3053
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,080
Here's a response

3054
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:48,640
So let's see

3055
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:53,760
Nomar Christmas is not lying

3056
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:55,296
Do you know

3057
02:32:58,112 --> 02:33:00,160
Okay

3058
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:05,024
These guidelines is this guy lying to you

3059
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:08,864
Because

3060
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,400
You making peace

3061
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:12,448
Think about that

3062
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:19,872
I got straight to think about

3063
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:22,432
You come to the end

3064
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:25,248
A lot

3065
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:26,016
Kind of

3066
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,040
I think

3067
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,064
Maybe you can

3068
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:29,088
Appreciate

3069
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,112
The beginning of this episode.

3070
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:30,880
First time I listen

3071
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:32,928
Through it I thought that was kind of like

3072
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:33,952
It's not as though

3073
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:34,720
Salacious

3074
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:35,488
A lot of the time

3075
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,560
Cuz there's not those like big reveals of like

3076
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:42,912
I told her we are like

3077
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,472
I mean you're dead

3078
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,496
You're dead

3079
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,288
Because yeah

3080
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:49,824
Hours upon hours of it

3081
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,104
Where is I've only listened

3082
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,128
The clips that you

3083
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:52,896

3084
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:55,200
Right through even at my most

3085
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:57,760
Project Camelot interviews

3086
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:01,856
Self it is 1/100 of what it is you deal with

3087
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:03,904
So when you listen to this episode

3088
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:12,352

3089
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:13,632
