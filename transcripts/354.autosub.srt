1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

2
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,392
Stripe.com

3
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Alex Jones

4
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
When was the last time you under

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Unplug the plug that you feel comfortable

6
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
It's been too long

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,576
Certainly not too far back but it's

8
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
Wake me up at Buddy's generally go on float trips

9
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
That's always a good

10
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
Although even work what's your smartphone you can still kind of bring them along

11
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,328
Kind of

12
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
Check out at the

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,752
I've long felt the call of nature

14
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
At least the last couple years

15
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
I've been definitely feeling like I want to do more camping with

16
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Difficult

17
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Emulating

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
A little crazy

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
And I have a cat

20
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
Call Mouser

21
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
That's it

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Chicago apartments version

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
I want to go camping but I have some difficulty

24
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
2

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Schedule of this show is very difficult

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,592
I like being outside

27
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
Things I miss the most about being in Central Missouri

28
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,808
Do you just go a little ways down you got to find a little bit of forest somewhere

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
You're going to be at

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Take a walk

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
You'll be outside

32
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
Slightly folks to your memory other than that actually it was real but

33
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
It was much more accessible Campground

34
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,968
Chicago realistically there probably are bunch of places that are not very far

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
From the city probably should go in Camp

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
No camping I told you it would go camping and you evolve

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,352
Almost fit on you have been very against that idea

38
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
I'd like to I'd like to do do that

39
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Unplugged

40
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Unhealthy to stay plugged in

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Turn on the present day when we're going to be going over October 8th and 9th

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Some interesting takes

43
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
On them

44
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Tremendously

45
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
I'm in one

46
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Alright whatever

47
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,224
Take the people who are

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Doing Hong Kong protest

49
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,392
And is against the companies who are trying to silence those protests

50
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
Exactly that's why I said okay to it okay

51
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,167
I agree with that

52
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
Be run by the literal.

53
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
BNB

54
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Not the devil

55
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
I guess it was another horrific take to but we'll get to that as we get to it

56
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
So first of all

57
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:50,047
Amapola

58
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239

59
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799

Text Evan

63
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
So first of all

64
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
And Neil thank you so much you're both wonderful technocrat

65
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,735
Business heroin

66
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
Freakishly large

67
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Baby lovey

68
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
We start off on the 8th

69
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
It has to do with

70
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Syria

71
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Alex's big

72
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,063
Scale

73
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,671
He's not even dealing with it on those terms

74
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
He's dealing with a situation where it's

75
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Totally cool to do whatever you want

76
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
It's in Northern Syria.

77
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
Just go for it

78
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
A very element

79
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Entry level

80
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
One of the pieces

81
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Which is not a great take

82
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,063
Position

83
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
The takes an interesting Journey throughout the course of this episode

84
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
He should put them in Hong Kong

85
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
The other one is

86
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
The other take that he has is that

87
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
Options

88
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
The other one is worse

89
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Was Obama and the

90
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
For 50 years

91
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Real

92
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
What's a neocon to the globalist

93
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,463
Wizard

94
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
With you

95
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
If you try to do that

96
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
That

97
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
Sir Alex's whole thing is you know I'm going to let these

98
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
Syria

99
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,887
Come through the Border unless I can set up this

100
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Space

101
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Taking what

102
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
Call the dictator says

103
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
Yeah right

104
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
With

105
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
You can always trust them to follow through on their word

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Precise

107
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Accurate

108
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Options

109
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Nuance

110
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,919
Absolutely dealing with the 3.6

111
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,527
Million more refugees

112
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
In Europe

113
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Course we have to let them

114
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
People there

115
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
Historically turkeys never

116
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Committed

117
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Vasquez

118
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Alakazam talkabouttd

119
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
Pat Robertson

120
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
If he does this if he allows

121
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Yeah

122
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Particular

123
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
Of Pat Robertson

124
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Sims words

125
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
Robertson

126
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Chinese proverb

127
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
A

128
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
So

129
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
One thing is true about the East Coast

130
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
Probably.

131
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,735
But on a larger scale I would say that there is a lot of

132
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Divine

133
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,903
It surrounds Trump

134
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Girl I don't think that

135
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Pat Robertson is quoting the Chinese referring to that I think it has to do with their ideas

136
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Is about divine

137
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,495
Rule

138
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
Robertson says he has the Mandate of Heaven

139
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
And that's a really important

140
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Squabble

141
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Do you want

142
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
Overtures to the idea that

143
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
God put them in our

144
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Evanescence

145
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
He said internet

146
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Should have been impeached

147
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Get out of here

148
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
So I think that's really interesting and

149
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
It's 8

150
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
It's when I heard I was like Alex

151
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,943
You know how much you talk about God and and Trump and all that

152
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Like you know

153
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
Pointed the finger at a Pat Robertson

154
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
Similar ideas in the opposite direction

155
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
Something different

156
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
You're an ass

157
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
Yeah so Alex's is p

158
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
Robertson

159
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Chinese proverb

160
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
In order to

161
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
Turkey to

162
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Come in and

163
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Start

164
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
People

165
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
Fair enough

166
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
I'm in Alex has an inch

167
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
Interesting position on sort of a

168
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Circumstance where in he would be against

169
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Record

170
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Being attacked

171
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,775
Unfortunately that has not been outlawed

172
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Northern

173
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
What

174
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Turkey

175
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
The United States has used the Kurds

176
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Special Forces

177
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,719
People are so brainwashed

178
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
What Muslim

179
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,423
So what

180
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
It does seem that Alex has a bit of a like

181
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,199
Christian

182
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,343
That's it.

183
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,463
Real scary

184
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
You know he's got

185
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,423
Speaking small number quite Parks Mall

186
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Necessary for

187
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
It's just a

188
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
We're there and we're watching

189
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
And to remove them as a signal that you

190
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
That bombs away we are not watching

191
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
The letter of

192
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Go ahead and commit genocide

193
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Annoyed with this phone call

194
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,999
That's usually not

195
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
You are

196
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Really

197
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
Winging it

198
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Or you're just lying

199
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
I'm not entirely sure which it is

200
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Because he gets

201
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,687
Completely 18 episode

202
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
You know there

203
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Trump

204
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
You're taking him out of Afghanistan

205
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
He's going to bring the boys home all this stuff

206
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
Just realized this is a completely stupid argument so but it's weird

207
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,447
I know all this stuff like the course of his episode like within 2 hours

208
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
He's like just

209
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Change

210
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,151
All but one thing we know for sure is that all these whistleblowers

211
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Coming out about Trump

212
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
His phone calls

213
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
Well it might not even be just a Democrat

214
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
It is

215
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
But you know they're allowing

216
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
We're talking about allowing

217
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
People to testify

218
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Because I suppose

219
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Which is what he would

220
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,191
Maybe but it you know their conversations

221
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Surrounding

222
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,871
That actually just going to try and bring like

223
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Clapper

224
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
In

225
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,783
End of story

226
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
The latest ladies and gentlemen

227
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Whistleblower

228
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Benicio del Toro

229
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
So because they've been burned Trump haters

230
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,695
Discredited now they have to put a little pixel

231
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,023
Whistleblowers

232
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Grade school

233
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
I like it like that

234
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
House floor

235
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
And they just turned the light

236
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Lights down on him

237
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
He's got a little vocoder out of

238
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
It's from

239
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Peter Frampton

240
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,551
It's not a

241
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
I don't know

242
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
Cecilia

243
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
Maggots the spirit enemy starts ranting about how his show is basically

244
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Just the spirit of America

245
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Are we all just

246
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Just going to let it go that

247
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
The Democrats

248
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Ratably afraid

249
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
That if they

250
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
Share the identity of the

251
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Stihl blower

252
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Other house representative

253
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
They will leak it and kill them

254
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Are we just going to all be like this

255
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
I guess I guess I guess that is

256
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,279
Americana Republic

257
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
The future

258
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,471
Information Warfare

259
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,375
This weekend if you know I'd really plug on

260
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,031
Doggy style plugin

261
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
This is crazy

262
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,527
We are the South America

263
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,343
Now I got to look

264
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Listen right

265
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
I'm not doing a good job

266
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
I am bad at

267
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
And I want to let

268
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
You know that

269
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
And that's why you

270
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,447
Big voice of Americana plug

271
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,591
All the time but I'm having a problem right now

272
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
So Alex gets back to the issue with.

273
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
Again

274
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
I think

275
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
Crystallization of his viewpoint

276
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,159
And it is a I don't care also Trump is doing the right thing

277
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Here's a president

278
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,127
We're going to move in and take over Northern

279
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
There's a present

280
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Man United

281
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
You know when that

282
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
The voice of Americana huh we've always been on the right side of History

283
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,703
If I recall correctly whenever we say as a country

284
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
It's not America huh right

285
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
Everybody when they read the history books are like

286
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
That was of the right

287
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,943
It certainly seems like that's the

288
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Find it to be compelling

289
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
I do not find it too

290
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Be at all

291
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Responsible or good

292
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:15,743
I'll because it's playing I guess who cares

293
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
You see that is just

294
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Epic

295
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Anyways black

296
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
The people who are going to be affected by the

297
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
The people are going to be murdered

298
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Yes

299
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Not affected

300
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Bright they would be affected

301
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,991
Behind all this, started all these

302
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
And what have you and

303
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,135
I'm sure there was there's more military action under Obama.

304
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,767
I'm comfortable

305
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,095
Open unfortunately as he's discussing that.

306
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
He ends up

307
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Piano

308
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Really showing some cards

309
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
About like

310
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,263
What he believes is going on in the world

311
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Obama wants more towards bush

312
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,735
Eliza country

313
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
Martial law

314
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
The whole Middle East is fighting over control

315
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,256
It's what the Muslim to hold never stop fighting

316
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
So it's just what the Muslims do

317
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
It's right

318
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Now I would

319
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Counterpoint

320
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Maybe

321
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Colonialism

322
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Exacerbated

323
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
Which okay

324
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
That's what the Muslims do

325
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
Essentially we already heard him say like

326
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
Syria was in the stable place

327
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
Under Assad and his father is

328
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Under control

329
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,192
He's essentially advocating for a world where like you can't have

330
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Under an oppressive dictator

331
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,736
Theocracy

332
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
You know that

333
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Wanted

334
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
We wanted to

335
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
Country it seems like a lot of this is a lot of what he's

336
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
He's implying

337
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Underneath

338
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
Police state

339
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,936
Mister anti tyranny

340
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,800
And he seems to be pretty clearly expressing The View that some people just got to live in tyranny

341
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Fight with each other Kill Everybody

342
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
It's what they do

343
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Just that he's also

344
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Also kind of Express

345
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
At least

346
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Overalls

347
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Strategy

348
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
With the Middle East

349
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Will let them fight it out

350
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,208
Yeah and then we'll deal with whatever is left

351
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,816
The other there is a little bit of that I mean he did literally say it's not our problem

352
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Set

353
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
China

354
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
Issues

355
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
On the side of against

356
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
So these companies that are trying to say

357
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Spencer Hong Kong

358
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
And that sort of thing

359
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Human is what we call

360
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Humanity

361
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
Years of looking Gaucho

362
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
And Alex has the Chinese government been exposed

363
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Censoring people that they aren't

364
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
I don't necessarily think

365
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Sync battle

366
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Stomach

367
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
In normal political

368
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
Talk

369
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Pretend that's not

370
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Even for the people of China

371
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Don't have a access

372
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
Tattoo vpns in the like that again

373
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
That allow them to see

374
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Internet

375
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
I think if you are

376
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Not one of those people

377
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Looking around for the

378
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Because of

379
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
You're not at the repressed

380
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Wheeler's understand

381
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
It's not hard to figure out

382
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,872
Yeah it's not like you're brainwashed to where you can't see this

383
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
404 not found

384
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,344
He was taking off social media and all of these

385
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Kicked off YouTube

386
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
It's all because

387
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
He had the program

388
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
To take down the Chinese government

389
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
How to fight the Chinese evil government

390
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
And now look out

391
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,824
They're all

392
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
Everybody who criticized

393
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Is China

394
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
Completely silenced Ananda

395
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,576
And there's an essential problem because he's also won't stop talking about the new episode of SouthPark

396
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
It was all about China

397
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
It was all about like

398
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,584
Absolutely

399
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
That is a counterexample

400
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,384
He doesn't understand that he's like everybody no one's allowed to talk about

401
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Not as great as Southpark just came out

402
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Please suck it

403
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,392
You do realize I don't I don't know how what the ratings are doing now but

404
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
On Comedy Central

405
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Biggest shows

406
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
Maybe you're the last decade

407
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah

408
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Enter Alex tries to play eclipse

409
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
From the South Park episode

410
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
It does not go well

411
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
He is totally fine with

412
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Drum roll please

413
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
Music

414
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,312
Next hour after our guest lasers devoted Club

415
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
It's not a big deal happy with it

416
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Cell phone

417
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
Guy who said

418
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Furious

419
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,768
Alex but overcompensating

420
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,144
Yeah we know the Pulsar attack

421
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
Yeah I guess coming up after the break and that is of course

422
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
The anti-communist himself Joel skousen

423
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,688
Joe Cason comes in and you know I think he is

424
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,480
Providence in the show

425
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Is hedging

426
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
A little bit by Alex's Park

427
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Still very aggressive

428
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
Pro Trump

429
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
I'm frequently on Alex's show

430
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Says that Trump is stupid

431
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,168
Coming up more regularly now makes

432
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Methinks italics

433
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Who's trying to like

434
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
At least leave that door open a little bit

435
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Okay you think

436
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
If

437
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
It goes down in the public

438
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Opinion

439
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Then he'll be able

440
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
I had this guy on there

441
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,816
Critical voice

442
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:53,216
Keep him credible and fresh and the audiences mind in case you do decide I got a jump ship on this

443
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,360
You still have an expert you can go to as opposed to all the other

444
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Yeah

445
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Alex talk

446
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Earlier episode

447
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
Alex's thing was

448
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,208
It doesn't matter what's going on in Syria and it's great

449
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
Thousand has a completely different take on the

450
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,424
But there are several much more larger bases with combat troops

451
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
South of that area insurance

452
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
And so Trump has been given some false intelligence that you're going to be leaving Siri if you take out these two outposts just not true

453
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,504
I think he's been snookered by a larger agenda

454
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:43,648
What major war start with turkey and the Kurds that will then justify

455
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:50,048
Pushing chop into letting Armed Forces come back in the series

456
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
A massacre occur between turkey and the Kurds

457
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,824
Turkeys were the largest conventional military

458
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Alex

459
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
He's definitely eater

460
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
A hundred percent

461
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,624
Gadsden is very accurately pointed out this is not good

462
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,952
To be a meaningful withdrawal this is

463
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
If anything cause

464
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,816
Awful result

465
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
Make it more likely that more people will go in

466
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Pushing forth as like

467
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
He said he's going to bring the guys home

468
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
It's not our problem

469
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
I mean it's sad how easily Alex

470
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Completely Falls in line with

471
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
Cousins position like he's completely convinced them

472
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Within a matter of minutes

473
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
To go completely against what he was saying earlier in the office

474
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Sharia

475
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
Question

476
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,104
What does President Trump

477
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,456
Let me talk to sleep

478
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,256
It's crazy

479
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
That Blake

480
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
His position I thought he was going to

481
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Ease into it maybe be like

482
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,520
I think you have a

483
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:42,176
Set up

484
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
These are these are serious issues

485
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
Like he doesn't have any idea

486
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,816
Break for him to completely change the narrative

487
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,728
You know when your commercial

488
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
I think Alex might be

489
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
New career for a commercial greatest changes his narrative

490
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
What's a president

491
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Sitting in there and he's on the phone

492
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
He's like

493
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
Go ahead

494
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Battleships

495
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,280
And then what are the Secret Service agents you know what I think we should

496
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
Protect the joke about this

497
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:38,240
Do you know because it is very serious threat like

498
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Elderly against

499
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Military

500
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
But there is

501
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
I can't obey

502
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
It's the

503
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
It's really tough

504
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
The only thing that

505
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Amusing about this

506
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
Is the fact that Alex flips

507
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Like it it seems like something that she should care about more

508
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
It seems like something that you should

509
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:13,824
Have a robust position on that isn't influenceable just by Joel skousen today

510
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
You're wrong

511
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,224
But really

512
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Has anything until

513
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,600
Detox

514
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Now move forward

515
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
I'll contradict myself

516
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,328
Episode

517
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,376
Who cares it is weird how in

518
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
The span of

519
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
2 days

520
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
We've had

521
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Search

522
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Obviously

523
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
Evil ship

524
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
It happened that

525
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Even the Republic

526
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
Jesus Christ we have to save it

527
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Overwhelming

528
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
But

529
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
We come in on the 9th and we find out whatever

530
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Republicans are in

531
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
In a bad position

532
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,144
That's not really true if you look at real poles

533
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,472
Marvelous

534
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
17 to 25 points

535
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,872
How many of the Democrats America is

536
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
I don't like being gassy

537
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
Athlete that bad

538
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Politics as a reference

539
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Just pulling data

540
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
Literally every

541
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
He was down

542
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
1.2 Trump

543
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Every single other relevant Democrat that they had at least five

544
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Points

545
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
In Outlook consistently

546
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
Another study the came out of

547
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
Beginning of this month I believe

548
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
October 3rd

549
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Trump

550
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
Is down 11-2 a generic Democrat

551
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,400
Just fill in the blank Democrat

552
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:18,240
Jesus Christ I don't know what real pools you talk about

553
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
I don't know

554
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
Phone internet polls

555
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
He couldn't couldn't actually say that 97

556
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Percent of the population

557
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
That's just too far

558
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
17 to 45 points we do know that he has a real tender

559
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:46,912
Towards those unscientific internet

560
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,032
The real

561
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
6 people that is the same

562
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
Yeah and you're not even

563
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Sure

564
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
So Alex a real

565
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:12,512
He's feeling good on this episode

566
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
As we saw that last episode

567
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
He was not even internally right

568
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Oracle of Omaha

569
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
He always has against

570
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
It really is true

571
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,320
No one is as accurate as info

572
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
Almost you know more than I do

573
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
We are at the crossroads

574
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,688
Communist China

575
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
Capitulated everything else

576
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Even talk to me good little politically correct minions

577
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,816
You did an hour on the South Park episode yesterday

578
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,936
I don't I don't know I think it's definitely possible to overuse

579
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
We're at the crossroads

580
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Living proof

581
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
You can overuse things like

582
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
They're making their move

583
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
Do you do that

584
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Main push

585
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
It's overused

586
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
Shirt that could be overused

587
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
Yeah there's not much he doesn't

588
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
Everything

589
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
No but that's how he feels

590
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
Really get into the intro music

591
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Commercial break

592
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,752
He really gets into the

593
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,360
I do know this is one of those things I like

594
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,944
Sometimes it be like I hate this guy but that passion is effects

595
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
This might be one of those cases

596
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
Although you might not be susceptible to it I'm not sure

597
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,976
Original Florida for you

598
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,008
Compromise

599
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,360
Information Wars

600
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:49,952
Freebirds knows I can't change Lord knows I can't

601
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
I guess that one wasn't as good as some of the other

602
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,632
Time to Stone s*** like that

603
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,704
Modern-day Patton

604
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,080
That revivalist

605
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
1000 people in there and I'm watching

606
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:50,112
Oh I got to go I got to get out of here this is a very scary place

607
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,120
Are you know like he's also talking about like we're going to give it to Hilary I should point out that

608
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,520
Is now really ramping up his Hillary is going to run talk

609
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:14,176
Talking about how Trump's really obsessed with her keep Street in the batter and like maybe we should have a rematch

610
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,480
Things like that

611
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
So excited about that

612
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,416
Everybody in that right-wing world is so excited about

613
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
She said something to indicate

614
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
But she's going to run

615
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
So now what

616
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,632
Together

617
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
She's going to run again

618
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,224
Play the clip of her on that talk show couple times

619
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
Great man

620
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
In our lives

621
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
What we need to do

622
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
You need to choose what team

623
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Nothing for plastic

624
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
We need to choose whether we're with

625
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
The globalist

626
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Or

627
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,104
Right

628
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
Is a false dichotomy the Bears

629
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
No

630
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Or do you want to go with me

631
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Ideals

632
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
And the Renaissance in Christendom

633
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
Dodge Hellcat

634
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
Or do you want to be in a

635
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Gremlin

636
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
It was don't either sound like choices

637
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
I mean like

638
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,544
So you've got on the one hand the globalist authoritarian State and China machine

639
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
Of course

640
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,760
You've got the ideals of the Renaissance ultimately lead to

641
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Coming sluggish and awful

642
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,136
Or whatever

643
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
Avengers

644
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
He does

645
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
He's not at all

646
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Is so

647
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
Write these ideas of the

648
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Right there so strong a breeds

649
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
So much.

650
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
Success for everybody

651
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,360
But the first generation

652
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:56,735
Well

653
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:03,135
And the third generation is all evil because

654
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,439
Whatever

655
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
Like being trapped in a cycle of

656
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
I feel like there's another option

657
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,079
These are the only games

658
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Downtown

659
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Go on

660
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Infinite wheel

661
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Reincarnation

662
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
In misery

663
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
Can go on these

664
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Straight line

665
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Nope there's no other out

666
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,535
You change scenery a little bit

667
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,119
Preferable

668
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:54,335
It's like well it's like

669
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
Because they

670
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
They're going to be in the generation

671
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
Not the one that gets f***** over by

672
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
Does feel that way a little bit

673
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,671
So Alex is realizing that he's kind of

674
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Supporter

675
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
Speech

676
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
What have you

677
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,351
But he realizes more

678
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Need to actively

679
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,679
Support free

680
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
I'm not sure exactly

681
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Mkg about that

682
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
Entirely sure what

683
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
But if I had to choose

684
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
I would say that's probably what it is

685
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
He is in the situation that

686
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,047
Is that where he's not on Facebook

687
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
He's a threat to China

688
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
Google

689
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,103
And all the people

690
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,223
Months ago

691
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Hideout

692
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,239
Celebrity that virus on CNN

693
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
If popular gets a sword

694
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
We weren't

695
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,391
Supposed to believe that

696
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,431
Weird feelings about this what does that mean like what do you want

697
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
Like to go to war with China

698
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,575
Do you want to cut off all economic relations with China

699
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
These things are

700
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Like productive

701
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,767
Suggestions

702
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
I don't know what he's advocating for

703
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
Other than getting him back on Facebook

704
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
Well

705
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,007
We're doing great

706
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
So I suppose the next logical

707
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Conclusion

708
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Is regular

709
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:45,087
Registering

710
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:50,719
I guess you probably could rationalize that

711
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
And it's military

712
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
A lot of people are suggesting he is turning on

713
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
A little bit

714
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
He's running

715
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
As a term or less

716
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,879
Promoting on his side are critical of trump there's a

717
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:24,767
There's a change in opening over on the Old Judge report a little bit and

718
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,119
Article you can find about that and I know that

719
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
CNN's not a really great source

720
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Now it's his world

721
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,383
The guy from Gateway pundit

722
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,783
The f*** is going on with Matt drudge like people in the world are starting to notice that shift editorial

723
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
Towards a critical one of drop

724
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah

725
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,159
If Alex loses Matt Drudge

726
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
Baby

727
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
I don't know how I like

728
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
What are the reasons I think that is good

729
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
Can't throw Matt drudge overboard

730
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
He just can't

731
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Still aggravated

732
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:12,127
Alex's yeah I don't I don't know what else I don't go check out the Drudge Report

733
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,479
Love story

734
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,551
Little bit

735
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,439
But Isaac bore importantly because of Alex's narratives that he's built up over the years

736
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,023
Matt drudge is the only Patriots still last out there

737
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
If you can't let that slide

738
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,751
Like I think that would be a bridge too far from The Cross by the globalist to something like

739
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
Really don't think you could do that

740
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,103
Judges to Central to Alex's

741
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
World

742
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
For him to

743
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
To turn him into a villain

744
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
For to like

745
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,575
Allow him to be working on the other team

746
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
Alex would have to migrate with Drudge

747
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
You know that's that's

748
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Position for

749
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Because

750
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,863
We're really finding out right now how

751
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
That's exactly how much

752
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
People are are

753
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Like

754
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Lindsey Graham is

755
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
So far in

756
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
One of his big like

757
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
Is pervious like let's not allow them

758
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
And now he has to be like

759
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,135
I guess I can't I can

760
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,951
Can say I don't agree with it but I can't say f*** this

761
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Functionally like not a

762
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
An interview

763
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Republic

764
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
Not voted on

765
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
He's not

766
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
He has no accountability for criticized

767
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Unique position where he like

768
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,847
Create so much of the tone

769
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,455
The conservative media sphere with

770
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
There's so many lazy conservatives

771
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
He has this

772
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Kinship with the audience

773
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
If he starts going

774
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Towards a critical stance on Trump

775
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
That allows

776
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
People in Congress

777
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
Easier time to not have to

778
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
Eutawville because the people down

779
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
Stream the citizen

780
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Did the consumers of the

781
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
These news articles

782
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
Will start to

783
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,431
Change along with drugs

784
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
It'll become more acceptable

785
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
Which is also very sad

786
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Thing to watch

787
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Can you

788
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,183
Ramp down

789
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
The propaganda

790
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Because they can

791
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Critical

792
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Can't do likes

793
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
Anti-trump

794
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
So can he

795
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Mission down or has

796
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Pandora's Box

797
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Aspen open

798
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
And we're just

799
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
You know

800
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
I don't know

801
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
I don't know it is

802
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
It's an interesting question

803
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
The proper

804
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Machine Head

805
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Has been going

806
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Hi

807
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Since

808
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
Late

809
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Early 20s

810
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Whenever everybody before that

811
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Yeah probably

812
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
But

813
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Now it's like

814
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
Can they can they still

815
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Control it

816
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
It's something that I'm really in

817
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,239
Did you find out especially as like

818
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,775
Your community is like a people

819
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,871
That are so outside

820
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
Ivanova Drudge

821
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,967
Redbubble

822
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Bush jr.

823
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,319
Easier

824
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Being

825
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,463
CertiFit disseminator of talking so much

826
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Diversity of crazy

827
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,815
I don't know how much like

828
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
100% change

829
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
Or it would be even more alien

830
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,519
Because those people are going to come along for that ride

831
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
World

832
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Cuz I was like

833
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
I mean

834
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
Splinter in

835
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
In order to combat

836
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
The fact that they filled it

837
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Single worst

838
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Human being in history

839
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,255
They had to turn the propaganda

840
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
All the way up to

841
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Revolution

842
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
You know

843
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
They've never been a

844
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
Without horrifying

845
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
And now

846
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Because that

847
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Splinter is a

848
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
They won't

849
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
They probably won't be able to put it back

850
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
It's just going to be

851
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,111
What's Brent realities now instead of hope you're wrong

852
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
Wolfie

853
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,975
Alex

854
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
So to speak

855
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
When everyone else Facebook

856
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
Apparently

857
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
He said Trump some letters

858
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
And they got delivered

859
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
Guest by hand

860
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
I don't know

861
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
So after this Alex got some

862
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
I'm desperate

863
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,151
Describes

864
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
You threaten his life

865
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,967
I have one

866
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Suspect

867
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
Jobs

868
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,039
So I believe that

869
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
Does the government

870
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,463
Is an epithet that is only attack I've ever heard in Alex's show

871
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,535
So I wonder if he threatened

872
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,095
100%

873
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:58,495
Descriptor has overthrown government is unique

874
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,663
I guess that it's very distinct

875
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Rivers

876
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
Who else would he

877
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
You say it about

878
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Jeffy

879
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,167
Delivering

880
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,239
Royal Flush because God did this

881
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,847
Move all of it

882
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,943
Impressed on me

883
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
The message was

884
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Literally

885
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
God

886
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,415
Alex you got to talk about

887
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Leadership

888
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
Americana

889
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
That leadership

890
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
So

891
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
God or his subconscious

892
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,063
Is telling Alex declare himself the leader

893
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,343
I'll l

894
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,671
I'm going to go out and I'm going to save it

895
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
He thinks

896
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:28,095
He has the Mandate of Heaven the reason I play that clip earlier episode

897
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,191
Because his behavior doesn't track somebody

898
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,775
Crazy for Pembroke

899
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,567
He has

900
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
That God is telling him

901
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
To declare his leadership role

902
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
I don't know if

903
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
I don't know how many times

904
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,783
Uttered by people

905
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,575
Well

906
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,695
I'm going to go to the Secretary of History over here when somebody says

907
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,791
To God and he is told them that leader how is that going

908
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,863
I would assume a couple times like this

909
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,423
Let's say there's a difficult project

910
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
To be done like a community garden

911
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
Getting built

912
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,383
I got called me to help build a lot of times alright individual

913
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,455
Jewels

914
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Express

915
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
Right on healthy way

916
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
Someone like Alex

917
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,695
Never find this to be an incredibly troubling

918
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,327
God called me to declare my I've woken up in the middle of the night

919
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,911
I know it's not even break down the whole f****** idea of like him being like

920
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,751
My subconscious

921
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Alex

922
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
Those different things

923
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
If he is expressing that he doesn't know the difference between his subconscious and God's voice

924
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,343
Not a problem it's a big problem

925
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
Speaks like a goddamn preacher all the time of the show talking about God's will

926
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Helping

927
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,399
Ascribe religious importance

928
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
Desires

929
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
That's not good

930
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,983
Yeah that sucks

931
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,799
Colt really did learn the right lessons

932
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,359
From Waco I think that's what we're learning right there

933
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,687
Declare yourself the representative

934
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,295
Tell people that they have to do whatever it is you say because you are there later

935
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
The only lesson to learn from weight

936
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
I went on a show where it like you saying s*** like this

937
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
And you're also existed

938
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Like

939
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
Head

940
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
As a guy who's like

941
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah you know what turkeys going to go in and take out these cards I don't care that's not our problem

942
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,591
Muslims just fight all the time

943
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,943
Have you read that deeply upsetting for someone

944
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
2

945
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Act like

946
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,111
Let's take a trip down a little bit lighter

947
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
Alex looks at a map

948
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
Of the United States

949
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:09,631
All this Matthew has all the like red areas and blueberries blue on there

950
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:13,983
Talking about how everybody in those blue areas

951
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
And then Alex realizes that he watched

952
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
Tombstone the night before

953
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Like John Wayne

954
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Clint Eastwood

955
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
Bruce Willis that are patriots

956
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,951
It's really almost everybody

957
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Bison

958
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
Set timer

959
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
Basketball player was

960
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Sarcastic

961
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Broccoli

962
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
The Patriot

963
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,047
Charlton Heston

964
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
The Patriot

965
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,199
Unwatchable

966
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:31,039
Kurt Russell's attractive whatever

967
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,623
Don't have to feel weird about that

968
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,207
But I can explain

969
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,047
Yeah it's not that everybody likes turns out to be a patriot

970
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,375
They like him

971
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,703
He is our all the sudden the huge fan of

972
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,543
Jen and I'm going to go out and I just wanted to

973
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Askew

974
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
Haha

975
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
What do all of those

976
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
Number of

977
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Are old

978
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
Number of liver old

979
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
Yeah

980
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Qualification

981
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,511
Having a money

982
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:20,959
Do we know if John Wayne liked Infowars

983
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
John Wayne was reportedly

984
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,943
Spider-Man

985
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
I just think it's awesome

986
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
Like these sorts of like presentation

987
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,391
The

988
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:46,559
See that these people are Patriots and I'm saying to them and then I learned that they're secretly fans of mine it's like

989
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
I did it it's a reinforced everyone else sucks

990
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,447
You just don't like people who don't like you

991
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,751
Great

992
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Mustache

993
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
What's tombstone

994
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
Kurt Russell in Tombstone

995
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Gloria

996
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:12,415
Sure

997
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
I don't know

998
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,863
Inquiring minds want to know

999
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,935
So

1000
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:28,031
PJ dubs article next episode

1001
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:34,687
What's your favorite Russell I have a favorite Kurt Russell escape from l.a.

1002
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
I don't know

1003
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
Look Paul Joseph Watson articles

1004
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
About how to

1005
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
To deal with China

1006
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,095
I'm old enough to remember when

1007
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Alex

1008
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,167
MP JW specifically

1009
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,751
Constantly decried people using boycotts

1010
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:37,151
The particularly they attacked people like ilhan Omar and those folks for the

1011
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,455
Idea of an Israeli

1012
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,063
They have been very.

1013
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,439
What is politically expedient for them whatever we figure it out

1014
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
Everyone

1015
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
They really can't

1016
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
This deal with

1017
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
There's no way that they can

1018
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Engage with the reality of this

1019
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,079
Ocean which is where orbit leader is not their leader is not

1020
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
It is money

1021
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,687
China has money

1022
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
To have

1023
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
That's it

1024
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,087
So they do whatever it takes

1025
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Perhaps

1026
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Issue

1027
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
Is not with

1028
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Leaders

1029
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
And more with

1030
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
System

1031
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
The most

1032
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
Explanatory easier

1033
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Explanation

1034
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
4

1035
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,263
And then they would have to say well

1036
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
Maybe there is

1037
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
Baby there's one negative effect

1038
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,383
Capitalism and then their whole game is

1039
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Like manifestly inconsistent

1040
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
Besan Alex

1041
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
Paul's Behavior over the course of

1042
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
The time that I've been watching

1043
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:57,535
Fight like I'm not necessarily totally opposed to the idea of like some sort of Target in Chinese

1044
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,887
Like that's the strategy

1045
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Fine

1046
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,983
Good on you but

1047
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,031
They're not willing

1048
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,823
They can't resist

1049
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,127
The urge to make cheap political points

1050
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,687
When other people use the same strategy as

1051
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
And that to me is a real problem

1052
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
To everyone should be

1053
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,207
Write the fact that it's not a problem to them

1054
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Troubling

1055
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
Alex gets

1056
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,839
Talking about how like

1057
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Orbitz

1058
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,471
But he can only ever really come up with one example

1059
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,103
World

1060
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Because everybody knows

1061
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Oracle of Delphi

1062
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
And there's just a bunch of poison gas

1063
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,375
Until people started listening and thinking

1064
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
God

1065
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,447
Oracle

1066
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:13,311
This year's research and focus and studying the CFR

1067
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,175
Putting the world which is

1068
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Within

1069
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
15 minutes prior to this 20 minutes prior he was talking about God talking to him

1070
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
Position

1071
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,255
Subconscious Ludacris

1072
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,327
Absolutely selfie

1073
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
What the hell is going on

1074
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,703
You know what they would just go there

1075
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:46,335
Woodstock under a house

1076
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
It's the

1077
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
I don't know

1078
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:59,135
I guess it just does work but it seems so awful to exist

1079
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:05,535
Is telling you to do things and other people who believe God is telling them to do things

1080
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,095
It's very strange

1081
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
Explain why religion

1082
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:17,823
Your is your goddess stupid virgins in heaven

1083
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:22,175
It's the same phenomenon as the boycott

1084
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,455
It's the same

1085
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,527
Everyone else

1086
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
Not realizing you're trying to do the same thing

1087
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
8th Street

1088
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:37,535
Absolutely infuriating that they always get away from it and they always get away with it and they win

1089
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:42,655
Furiated is probably pretty close to write on

1090
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Steve Miller sounds

1091
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Oh that's

1092
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
That's true

1093
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,823
That's not good

1094
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,127
Entire organization

1095
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,943
I would imagine spray-on hair

1096
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,015
Probably look bald

1097
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,927
Maybe that was a pilot products

1098
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Brian Head Force

1099
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Mateo Coronavirus

1100
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
Look like a group

1101
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
New product

1102
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
Get out there

1103
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
So it's science Corner time

1104
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Alex got the bad news

1105
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
About the flu shot

1106
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,127
You know you're after here for the last

1107
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,735
The flu gets worse every year

1108
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,415
50%

1109
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,511
Free flu shots

1110
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:45,887
Alzheimer's and Dementia

1111
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,727
So frustrating

1112
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
So easy

1113
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,895
If you consult the cdc's.

1114
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,431
Six on a flu season

1115
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:03,039
Even if you just look at the years between 2010 and 2018

1116
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,879
Roberts really fluid you know some seasons are worse some artists bad

1117
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
There's a lot of variables

1118
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,695
That's what I told hymers thing

1119
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,255
Supported by any actual science

1120
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:18,911
According to a paper in the Canadian Medical Academy journal from 2001 at which was just writing up of a study that looked at

1121
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,727
Exactly this possible correlation it senior citizen

1122
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
They found

1123
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,311
After adjustment for a****** and education

1124
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
Past exposure to vaccines against diphtheria and tetanus

1125
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Polio

1126
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,271
Poliomyelitis and influenza was associated with

1127
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,319
That no exposure to these vaccines

1128
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
Getting a flu shot annually

1129
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
Actually says your risk for dementia

1130
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,327
But these studies are all clear to point out that the results

1131
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,375
Definitively say there's a causal relation

1132
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,239
What are you saying is 100% supported by

1133
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
Absolutely not true

1134
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,919
I don't I don't

1135
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
I don't understand

1136
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
The framework

1137
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Any study that

1138
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,295
Be centered around

1139
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
3 years

1140
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Flu vaccine

1141
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,695
Like why would you choose three

1142
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
Say longer.

1143
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Yeah he had

1144
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Probably

1145
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
I'm sure it's everybody

1146
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,031
Certainly

1147
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,567
Who are anti-shock

1148
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,175
Fox Sports

1149
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,567
So what are you talkin about here is a conversation

1150
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:11,039
Arizona Cardinals

1151
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
Not gotten

1152
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
He was offered wanted

1153
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
CVS

1154
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,743
Which isn't the same thing as Fox making him get one at all if you really get down to it

1155
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,143
I took one flu shot my life in immediately got the flu I did that was the last one

1156
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,215
So seems like he's not trying to talk to him to get a shot either

1157
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:34,591
Seems like those parts of the story things I was just making up in order to make this sound good

1158
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,407
Just a dumb conversation

1159
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:41,759
Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless

1160
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
Hey look I don't

1161
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
I refuse to engage with

1162
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Somebody who is quoting

1163
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
To tighten

1164
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Uptake

1165
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
Inskip

1166
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
F****** Bayless

1167
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
Send Shannon

1168
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Sure great

1169
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
I don't give a f*** what they have

1170
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
To say about

1171
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Literally

1172
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,471
Anything and that includes photo

1173
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,263
Vetta Sports

1174
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,311
Those two idiots are still

1175
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,895
I think I think it's interesting because we have is the

1176
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:15,295
The kernel of something real

1177
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
Fox Sports

1178
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:26,047
Another never going to take only one of them reference getting the flu after getting the shot

1179
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
Which

1180
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,863
Better explanation for them

1181
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Get walkers

1182
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
You just explained

1183
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
The whole career

1184
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,919
Next

1185
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,991
Alex is talking about how he's right about everything

1186
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
Michelle

1187
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Good God

1188
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
Subconscious

1189
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Mandate of Heaven

1190
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,463
So Alex

1191
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
Reference in particular alien

1192
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
To mr.

1193
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,167
Project Camelot Animal Human hybrid

1194
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,775
Totally right about all that

1195
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
I'm not so interested in that

1196
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,919
I know that he's not engaging with real science

1197
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:20,319
He's creating sci-fi weirdo

1198
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Quit demonstrate

1199
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
Alex

1200
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
Is still

1201
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:27,743
Really mad about something that happened to him in Delo

1202
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,767
Distant

1203
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Okay

1204
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:36,959
Major topically

1205
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,263
That was an MIT research

1206
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:43,103
23 years ago

1207
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,431
Because they never saw it on the news

1208
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
How much is the

1209
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,111
Grocery stores

1210
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
Pizza places

1211
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,903
It's in the simulation to put your hands on me again

1212
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,335
What is

1213
01:12:54,527 --> 01:13:00,671
I didn't realize that was before I think the point is that he's mad

1214
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Maybe unduly

1215
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,375
And it was a perfect

1216
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:14,751
Conan

1217
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
Conan's Pizza

1218
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:20,383
Seems like it's on Branford place

1219
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
Just wright

1220
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,503
Got2b

1221
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
Toyota Concord

1222
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
I just find

1223
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,975
Things like this no this is along the same lines

1224
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,375
Just a real under the surface

1225
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,655
Severe anger

1226
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
Creeps out every now and again

1227
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,519
Look at

1228
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Explicable

1229
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,943
Especially for something this trivial

1230
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,991
Sure

1231
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Let It Go

1232
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,063
Alex

1233
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
Let It Go

1234
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,463
Does exploit detox about you know

1235
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
Surrounding

1236
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,143
Is something better is apparently Chinese a nature so I don't know why

1237
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
So he's the second coming compared to Hillary

1238
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,999
The same thing it's still just a religious save your messages

1239
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,279
Yeah we don't we don't have to

1240
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:49,215
He's doing that because she is now throwing her head back

1241
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,543
All the time

1242
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,079
But I mean he doesn't need that

1243
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
Obviously

1244
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,407
Please don't talk about her all the goddamn time

1245
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,247
But yeah

1246
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
It's just it's just enter

1247
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Like this

1248
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
This this level of

1249
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
Taking such a fan

1250
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,207
Pat Robertson's comments

1251
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
For the reason that you have

1252
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,535
Laid out

1253
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,839
The Mandate of Heaven is

1254
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,655
Chinese Communist influence

1255
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,447
Creeping into America

1256
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,775
And then you go ahead and just use very similar

1257
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Terminology

1258
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,359
Imagery surrounding

1259
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,711
Very much like

1260
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,527
His real issue is with the Mandate of Heaven be

1261
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Traditional

1262
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Thought process

1263
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,695
No

1264
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,255
Not that it's not Robertson had said

1265
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,071
If you had

1266
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,655
He is no longer supported by God

1267
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:56,287
Alex would find a different way to hate his approach

1268
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Get to be like

1269
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,407
Now if Robertson

1270
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Trump

1271
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
This wouldn't be a conversation

1272
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:11,135
Alex

1273
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,535
But just because Pat Robertson

1274
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,607
Traceable back to

1275
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
A Chinese tradition

1276
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,959
That's the best way to go about this

1277
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
Easy

1278
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:31,359
So on our recent episode about the present-day Alex was doing

1279
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,919
Black Friday comes early sale

1280
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
Yes

1281
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,759
My position on that was

1282
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
The good

1283
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,671
Thing turns out it was a great thing

1284
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,951
Compared to his

1285
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,767
Call Shelly

1286
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
But a lot of things are coming back in

1287
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,087
Wild horses

1288
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,719
We're selling it

1289
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,023
At forty-two 70% off

1290
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,007
Going forward

1291
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,311
Next year we can go further

1292
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,151
I am I am I am transferring everything to liquid fuel

1293
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,023
I have many connotations

1294
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
That are good

1295
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
For Everything Must Go sale

1296
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
The only

1297
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
The only business

1298
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,519
Everything Must Go is

1299
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,823
I didn't take those can

1300
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,687
The places you see that sign

1301
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:17,599
Over and over and over again for two years at least that had the everything

1302
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
Moscato

1303
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
Always

1304
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:26,047
Never anybody in there signs at let's say I don't know a Halloween pop-up

1305
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,119
Store in November 3rd

1306
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:33,215
I don't think that most places that are doing well

1307
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,287
Heaven Everything Must Go sale

1308
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,359
Everything Must Go not a good sign

1309
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,575
Everything Must Go is not a term

1310
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,111
Vex

1311
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,439
I feel like Alex be aware enough of that

1312
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:58,303
This looks bad Marie kondo

1313
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
Could be

1314
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:06,751
I don't know I don't know based on

1315
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,479
But also according to all these products are selling out

1316
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,783
I don't know I don't know

1317
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
As always

1318
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
Speculative analysis

1319
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,159
Full of s*** all the time so

1320
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
I'm not going to put too much stake into anything like that

1321
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,047
But I do feel like he has to know that his audience

1322
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Like

1323
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:36,447
At no matter what is true no matter what you can talk them into

1324
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,263
I think everybody who's alive

1325
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,079
Understands that an Everything Must Go sale

1326
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:48,223
Is very close to a going-out-of-business

1327
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,247
People's minds

1328
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
It kind of gives

1329
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,063
A feeling of

1330
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,343
Surrender

1331
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Yeah

1332
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,695
I don't know if I were out of soda

1333
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,279
I would go with the

1334
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,959
One last car wash to save the rec center sale

1335
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:13,055
Redford

1336
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:17,664
Everybody wants

1337
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,688
To rule the world

1338
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
That song

1339
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
It gets really whiskey

1340
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
School for him

1341
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,088
You get very sentimental

1342
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
This is a f****** weird

1343
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
Will tripped-out Alex's brain

1344
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,888
Drink war on corruption Alex Jones

1345
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:44,288
Listen to an album

1346
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:02,976
Okay

1347
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
Does a family show Jordan

1348
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,824
Tears for Fears trying to bang mom

1349
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,688
What am I telling this girl

1350
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,504
Weird you're very weird

1351
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Cherry strain

1352
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:34,208
Alex gets into small business

1353
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,608
This clip doesn't really matter too much except for the end of it cuz it demonstrates

1354
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
Ineffectiveness

1355
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:51,104
Information that he gets in real-time pulls up information

1356
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,152
Document and stuff like that

1357
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,248
He ends up but he's not able to process what he's seeing at all

1358
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,392
Perhaps over confidently gloatingly

1359
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
That are

1360
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,752
Table runner

1361
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,296
Unbelievable

1362
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,576
What's up

1363
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:38,208
More

1364
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,616
True

1365
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,664
150

1366
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,992
The total amount invested by everyone in that round of funding

1367
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
What's 300

1368
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:08,672
There was 150 million from other sources with investor in the session

1369
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,720
That's a completely different thing

1370
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:17,120
150 150 that they invested making it 450

1371
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Million dollars

1372
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:24,288
150 million

1373
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:31,712
2 million if we're going to run your three billion dollar company

1374
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,528
Its 5% ownership if it was

1375
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Strict

1376
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,320
By mistake

1377
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,672
Is a control of the board

1378
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,280
This is hot bulshit

1379
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:50,144
But what I want to make perfectly clear is the way that Alex doesn't care about

1380
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
It's just the optic

1381
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,984
The Optics need to be that tencent is running

1382
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:59,616
With $0.10 in the headline

1383
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,944
That's got to be three hundred billion

1384
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
Given fact check any of us even say later like oh I'm sorry I got that wrong it is

1385
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,136
Round of investment there was other

1386
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
Firms that also joined in

1387
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,280
07:00

1388
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
Well I know that

1389
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,448
Who is that Snoop Dogg is a big investor but I'll take that much

1390
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
For that

1391
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
50 Cent

1392
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
Tears for Fears

1393
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
50 Cent

1394
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
I've no idea

1395
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,992
It's a present episode Jordan

1396
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
So you know that means

1397
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
Got to talk to Robert Barnes

1398
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
Barnes

1399
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
How is Barney

1400
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,136
He's always on

1401
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,208
He is never far away from Infowars microphone

1402
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,744
So Barnes

1403
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,096
Comes in they want to talk about this whistleblower situation with Donald Trump

1404
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,120
Sure they want to

1405
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
Incite a riot

1406
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,472
Super boring

1407
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,776
I just want to play this clip

1408
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
Because I think

1409
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,360
This isn't something good to hear from a lawyer

1410
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,736
When you have someone doing something

1411
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
Isn't

1412
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,648
Adversarial

1413
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:23,328
So I believe Robert barnes's is that you have to commit a crime in order to

1414
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,936
From my reading of the definition

1415
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
I'm not a lawyer

1416
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,520
But I believe legal things

1417
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:35,104
In order to obstruct an investigation

1418
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
So

1419
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
I don't

1420
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
Know if I

1421
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,992
Okay

1422
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,320
Just because you murdered a guy

1423
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,624
Doesn't mean that it was

1424
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,208
As long as you murdered him League

1425
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Right

1426
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
And it makes perfect

1427
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
I guess so

1428
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,376
Alright I'm coming around

1429
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
I think he's a

1430
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,936
Great lawyer

1431
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,032
I signed the red flag

1432
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,944
And frankly and record

1433
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Legal Minds

1434
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:17,600
So Barnes about all this stuff middle of it Alex

1435
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,160
William Binney

1436
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,720
The former technical head of the NSA

1437
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,768
And pretty

1438
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,664
Wikipedia

1439
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:45,760
LeBron James War

1440
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,672
Very

1441
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Superman

1442
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,376
Oriental people that can call things way ahead

1443
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,984
Giddy about that's what makes me excited

1444
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,688
Chicken you know what dimension

1445
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,272
Sh.

1446
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,112
Your child breakdown insurance

1447
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,440
Those of us that love Johnson

1448
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:38,496
Smooth there was

1449
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,336
Really right about everything

1450
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:49,248
One strike

1451
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Maps

1452
01:27:55,392 --> 01:28:01,536
Who could forget about the time that you came on Alex's show around the time of the Devin Nunes memo any claim

1453
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:07,936
He had a copy of the memo which reported on are and they read from

1454
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:13,312
It was a public document

1455
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,736
I do not care about this dude

1456
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,320
I do like Alex's to

1457
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,600
Categories of person

1458
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
For which you become speech

1459
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,184
Speechless mathematicians

1460
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
And Prophets

1461
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:36,864
Well he's saying that cuz Barnes is still there and Barnes is a notoriously political gambler

1462
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,384
F****** idiot so I don't really particularly care too much about what will you bring to the table

1463
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,176
Guess what it is

1464
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,992
Just everything is a G Street against Trump

1465
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:58,112
I feel like with the Seth Rich stuff

1466
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
I don't

1467
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Really

1468
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,208
I don't view you as someone worth my time

1469
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:07,072
Even looking into what you're talking about with the the Nunes memo thing

1470
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:13,472
That was being passed off on Alex's show there's many ways from Vikings

1471
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,592
Gets sent off to the Dustbin of propaganda

1472
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:22,688
Witches don't care

1473
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Perhaps

1474
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,392
I don't know if Benny's got it though

1475
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,488
Careers

1476
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,704
He doesn't have that

1477
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,752
Spark you're not in this last clip

1478
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
Because

1479
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,080
Where we're going

1480
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Resigning off

1481
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,944
They do talk for a couple minutes after this and then Mike Adams takes over.

1482
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
As Alex's raped

1483
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,784
Globalist

1484
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
Somehow they just wanted

1485
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,576
Destroy everything

1486
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
Something goes terribly wrong

1487
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,928
Control

1488
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
This isn't

1489
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Hello

1490
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
No

1491
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,488
Hello Kitty watch the circus

1492
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:48,448
Beautiful hello please

1493
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:54,848
Over the music

1494
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:06,624
That's the president

1495
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,184
Has Mike turned off

1496
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:15,840
I accidentally hit a button on Alex

1497
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:22,496
Leaving Bill pretty high and dry that's why I don't think he has the juice don't show

1498
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,824
Sorry to do is say hello

1499
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:32,224
Very weird we'll be right back

1500
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
Just over that big

1501
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,552
Hello

1502
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,088
Hello

1503
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,880
Is anybody there

1504
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,464
No

1505
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:46,048
It is not

1506
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,072
And like that is

1507
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,096
Is pretty bizarre

1508
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
Ultimately

1509
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
I don't find

1510
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,520
A ton of inspiration the present-day Ulysses

1511
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,544
Episode

1512
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,872
There is like a lot the real world

1513
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,992
Touchdown by Alex

1514
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Irresponsibly

1515
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
Absolutely

1516
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:10,624
The situation in Syria

1517
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,416
That's very

1518
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:15,232
Serious and very real like that requires

1519
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,536
Immediate action

1520
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:22,144
Without

1521
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,192
This isn't withdrawing troops

1522
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
This isn't the things that I'm presenting it as

1523
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
I just I just

1524
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,104
It's so much of this is is

1525
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
Very uninspired

1526
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
Yeah I know so very predictable

1527
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,736
Lick so much

1528
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,856
Any piece of news could come out regarding the Ukraine

1529
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,160
Any just going to say this is all about Biden

1530
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,976
You know it you can you can have that

1531
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,792
Happens in the world ads China's fall China sucks

1532
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,328
I'm right about China

1533
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,864
I'm the king of China

1534
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Yeah

1535
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:01,056
They're interesting trends that I'm interested in following like we talked about the idea of what happens if Drudge

1536
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
Leave the team

1537
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,360
But that's interesting

1538
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,640
But interns

1539
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
It's just

1540
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,736
You go in and expect to find

1541
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,528
An interesting

1542
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,832
Take Dora position

1543
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
Is Alex going to

1544
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,672
His principal should lead him

1545
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,000
To abandon Trump over the turkey

1546
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:26,144
And Siri really should especially considering how severely he took

1547
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,776
Drunk on Aaron's cream truck show

1548
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,896
That this would be sort of a like well there's no explanation for this

1549
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
Acceptable

1550
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,944
But it's not it's

1551
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:42,016
It's nothing to him

1552
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
It is it is

1553
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
Bournout

1554
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
I think what we

1555
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:54,816
It's just

1556
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Just to bulshit

1557
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:03,264
Yeah everybody is a overpowered and

1558
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,104
We have the presidency the Senate the courts

1559
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:11,968
Supreme Court like to know if it's still we're the victims and the little guys

1560
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,016
Yeah you can try that and it

1561
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:19,392
Probably works for a bit for a while but it's illusion falls off eventually

1562
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
Especially when

1563
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,952
Call mickley

1564
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,720
Inept

1565
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,024
Who has no

1566
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,816
Connection to your

1567
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,888
Reformer adversarial position

1568
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,960
You're the things that you would criticize

1569
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:37,056
The other side about you're absolutely

1570
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
Given up or

1571
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Forgotten

1572
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
Or whatever

1573
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
Come to

1574
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Purity

1575
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
That's good I don't need

1576
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Think about it

1577
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
Going to make up shift

1578
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,720
Fandom anyways I don't even

1579
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
To have any credit

1580
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
And he doesn't

1581
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,072
Work

1582
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,608
He just lies about

1583
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Where is

1584
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
Power

1585
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,544
It's much easier to Bullhorn

1586
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,592
Absolution

1587
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Yeah

1588
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,152
It's it's

1589
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
Pointless

1590
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,784
He doesn't have anything

1591
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Yeah

1592
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,416
And then there's another Dynamic that is like sort of this

1593
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,512
Ratchet

1594
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,304
Should I get back up

1595
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,096
Sort of more recent episode

1596
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,400
So we've got over you see you like a real

1597
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,936
Intensity towards

1598
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
Civil War

1599
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,496
And stuff like that

1600
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:43,360
I take that still living in the background of these episodes

1601
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:46,432
Not much of a fever pictures

1602
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
Focus

1603
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,040
Like I would like

1604
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,648
Like having people go on that ride that roller coaster

1605
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
Intense

1606
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:01,280
I did this is a real threat

1607
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:07,680
And then I'm right about everything

1608
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
Yeah I mean

1609
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
Intentional

1610
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,312
I would also

1611
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
Based on its based on

1612
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
Erratic mood swing

1613
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,968
Totally so I would say that there's a combination

1614
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Both of them

1615
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,040
Happily dovetail into one-way dozen

1616
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,464
Intentionally

1617
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,792
Really consider the effect that might have had on people

1618
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,120
Where is move on

1619
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,984
I don't care that I was just yelling about the Civil War

1620
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,520
Boycotting China and

1621
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,592
Trying to make excuses for Trump's

1622
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,128
Ridiculous foreign policy

1623
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
I can't imagine

1624
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,272
Just the the clips that

1625
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,808
You know you share with me

1626
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
It f**** up my sense of value

1627
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,416
Like there's so many things where I'm like

1628
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,256
Civil War

1629
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:08,608
All of this and I don't know what's valuable and what's what we need to

1630
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
How we can even

1631
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,680
Perform triage on

1632
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,568
I don't know all of them

1633
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Equally

1634
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
And in his

1635
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
It's always difficult divorce

1636
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
Yourself from

1637
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,504
That reality of life

1638
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
It's a

1639
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
It's got to be weird

1640
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,720
Believe him

1641
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,256
It's like I can't

1642
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
I don't support

1643
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,048
Anybody

1644
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,096
Nobody is doing good

1645
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,656
Figs in any position of power

1646
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,192
It's so infuriating

1647
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,848
Muslim population

1648
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,640
That's f***** up

1649
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,832
I don't f****** care I'd like I do every everybody

1650
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
It's very it's very difficult

1651
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,720
Respond to this with any kind of semblance of

1652
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,048
I agree

1653
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
Play more so

1654
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,888
You got to do

1655
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,912
It's a struggle

1656
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:21,312
And I will someday but until then
