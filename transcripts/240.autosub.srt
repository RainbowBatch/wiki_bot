00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,872
Alex Jones

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
I think it was that one with the boat

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
Pirate pirate one

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,160
American history

00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,976
Hi on the Wii U but I never went

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
Let's

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,216
For that against me

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
I remember my friend Kevin Brody

10
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
Comedian Kevin Brody

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
In particular

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Very harshly to tasks

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
Score like Network

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
Looked at by cool kids as being the worst in the series

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Or something

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
Make my house

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
That's what everybody

18
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm actually going to role-play as a hunter

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
I'm out of the mainstream I saw in the group

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Somebody posting about

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Odyssey

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
Yeah

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
I love that style of game

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,248
Murder in perhaps

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,600
But I like that style of game a lot and I wish that I had a sister

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
I wish I wasn't so dedicated

27
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Nintendo

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
I'm never going to get away from

29
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
That's what's going to be

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Also

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,376
Never point out what they are

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,496
So today Mountain Dew Kickstart blueberry pomegranate

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
It's best that you don't know that you do

34
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
That is the fun

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,880
Where in March 2003

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
Alright

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
31st most people would remember that there 31 days in May

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
Can I had a hard time

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,472
I don't remember any of that

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Months

41
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
I've never been able

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Remember that

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
What's the

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896

I don't even go to 828 most of the time October I know that

47
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,256
31

48
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
That it would be 25 days and that is not correct

49
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Crapshoot could be

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
My birthday is in April I have no idea

51
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
I know August

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
It's 31 because of that

53
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
F****** guy

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
He had to have

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Is that right okay

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
I was willing to believe

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:06,368
Going over the 30th 31st today

58
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Before we get started like

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Play take a little time

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Say thank you

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,304

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Some new donors

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
People who have joined up with

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
First of all

65
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Thank you so much you're now

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920

Make a joke

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Also

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
I'm a policy wonk

71
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,464
You know what some days we get soda spiders at Wafers and Sundays

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
We get Chris Joe and Matthew

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,656
Can we still appreciate it all the same

74
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,472
Essentially

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Finally looks like

76
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Donated a little bit of

77
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
We appreciate it oh so very much

78
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
So Dominic

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
You are now a technocrat

80
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm a policy wonk

81
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Someone someone sodomites

83
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567

84
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
It says support the show

85
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Start a business

86
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Are we

87
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,415
This is a crazy this is a crazy little couple days

88
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
What we had

89
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
John Birch Society

90
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
President

91
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
McManus

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Waffle on some of his positions

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
I meant between his belly

94
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
I'm pretty hard into a

95
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
Go f*** yourself Glenn Beck

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Kind of thing

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
So I kind of expected those themes to continue and

98
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
It does it's always

99
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
No you jokes

100
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Narrative

101
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
A couple of a couple of completely nude air it is

102
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Is Varian

103
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Interesting

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Nothing at all

105
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
And the first one

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Is one of those interesting one

107
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
You don't know in 2017

108
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
Paul Joseph Watson now it's got really it.

109
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
I do remember

110
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
Everybody was like

111
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
Because mad at soy

112
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,271
Decade

113
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,903
Prisoners in jail

114
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Sixty 70% of store

115
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,495
Absolutely

116
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
That's one reason the boys are so effeminate and just so happens the Plastics

117
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Plastic leashes at Region

118
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
Hyper feminized

119
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,767
Shakopee Airport

120
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
No

121
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Absurd

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Global about is like 30

123
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Pre-pubertal indicators and stuff like that like

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
Adipose tissue growing in brass areas

125
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Stuff like that

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Most scientists

127
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
I heard right about it

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Lake that much more to

129
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
More overweight

130
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
But the entire in terms of like the hormone

131
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Aspects of it

132
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Stuff like that

133
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
That hasn't gone down significantly.

134
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
It's not it it's not 3

135
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
I thought it was

136
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Going higher

137
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm not fully up on the side

138
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
So I feel like I would be in the wrong

139
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Want to talk about it

140
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
To be just this idea of like pre-pubertal

141
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
As of like

142
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Glitches

143
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Most likely a function of a

144
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Also probably

145
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
We are all

146
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Soybeans

147
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Injected with

148
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Boss ladies

149
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Wild that that's there back then

150
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
What is it about

151
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
Replacing

152
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
And a lot of the people who

153
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Who have

154
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
Show interest in the world are big farms

155
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,935
Seems like that people who have large kill operations going

156
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
That's so they probably have a lot of financial

157
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,575
Demonizing vegetarian

158
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Everything

159
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Stop climb

160
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Be their primary

161
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
But it also could just be

162
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
Protecting their operation

163
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Which unfortunately has the Buy

164
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Product also of being

165
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
A very

166
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Colluding in

167
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Industrial

168
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
You shouldn't have any Carpenter

169
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,479
I think that I think it would be not too far of a leak

170
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
To make that argument

171
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Alex

172
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
I think a lot of

173
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Hatred

174
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Elmo's voice

175
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
Love the story hatred that you see probably traces back

176
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
To some sort of agribusiness money

177
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
The comes in

178
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Through lobbying

179
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
I would assume

180
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,311
Next year is that Alex

181
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
He's not

182
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
Off the mandatory service bill

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,039
Narrative even though it is past

184
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
All of the language

185
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Concerned about it's been stripped out of the Bell

186
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
It doesn't exist

187
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
But he is now a

188
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
But the danger

189
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Gone

190
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
With the fight and fight and fight

191
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
Pass the draft

192
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:03,903
Slavery

193
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Mandatory service Bill live Sean

194
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
It seems like

195
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Listed

196
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,551
Bunch of other stuff too

197
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
Note the house back

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
The language was flip from one bill in HR

199
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
Ford

200
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
Hr1044

201
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,359
Just Alex reading from an Infowars article and so obviously

202
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
The details

203
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
It's not going to be

204
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Necessarily

205
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:08,159
The language

206
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Blue Bell number one

207
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,047
They're f****** up the timeline of it entirely in order to present their version of it that is

208
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Massive Resistance

209
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
It's against this got that

210
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
Take it out when the language was already taken out by the time that Alex's

211
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
False resistance ever got involved

212
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
Now HR 144 is

213
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Isabel

214
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
It was introduced on March 11th 2009 before this episode

215
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
Just two days after the original mandatory service Bell

216
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Alex's make

217
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Shut up about was introduced

218
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,791
From what I can tell it looks like the reason for this was that the language in the original Bill HR 1388

219
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
About setting up a commission to explore the reasons for language and volunteerism in America was already in process of being

220
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Being taken out of that original belt

221
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,079
It was being introduced separately to remove that sticking point

222
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
From hr13

223
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
388 which would allow it

224
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
At the house

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Easier

226
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
That's day March 11th

227
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
HR 144

228
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
4

229
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
It was introduced

230
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
It was sent to committee

231
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Where.

232
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,695
No action taken on the bills since its introduction

233
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
And it has zero momentum

234
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,583
It has been dead in committee for 20 days before Alex knew existed

235
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Elizabeth dead in committee for a week

236
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
By the time HR 138/82 pasta

237
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Really

238
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Remember on our on our list

239
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
So whenever he started

240
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
Following finding out that

241
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Not going

242
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Gilera iPod

243
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Here's where we

244
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Looks like a victory

245
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
I about a bill

246
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
You won't

247
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
F****** guy and as long as it's in committee you can have like it stranger Phil you know it could be

248
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
I was way off on all the details

249
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Profoundly late to the

250
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
The party

251
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
Would have been covering this on the March 11th episode of the show not the f****** March 31st episode

252
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
This is nonsense this is just business

253
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Sloppy

254
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Battery lights

255
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
I got no

256
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Really really cold

257
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
Because that's how you know you're a good blacksmith to make a sword out of a hot pizza

258
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Piece of iron

259
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
Blacksmith

260
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,039
Felt good

261
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
I'd like

262
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
I like this

263
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,767
Because it is funny when you look at the Historical framework of it

264
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
At what you doing

265
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
I can't say that he does know

266
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,495
Some selfies like a journalist

267
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
You should know damn well what's going on

268
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,127
Put it in a separate bill NFL died

269
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
That's what happened

270
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Because it was

271
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,575
To some extent even controversial not just in right-wing propaganda in the right-wing of

272
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
What is ended up probably being

273
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
It would make it much more difficult for HR 138

274
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Which everyone was in favor of

275
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
You say kyline which out now the bill passes

276
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
So now the park

277
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
People disagreed on

278
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Happens all the time

279
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,567
Very standard Congress stuff

280
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
To note that we can neither

281
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
Confirm nor deny that Alex knows

282
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Anything

283
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
That is true

284
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
You should know this

285
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Does he know

286
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
I don't know

287
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
You're right we only have our expectations of what a human

288
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Should know to go on antos might be faulty

289
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,607
Absolutely should know he's contradict

290
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
This one is

291
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
Here's one of the battle of this

292
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
I had of as a person

293
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Bow

294
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Barack Obama's Kenyan repair Attica

295
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
Gifts for presidents meeting with the

296
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,535
Preacher

297
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
And give for presents

298
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,703
Disgusting Queen hereditary

299
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Pretty disgusting

300
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
I guess

301
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
The first sitting president to go meet with

302
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
The queen

303
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Track 25 before she was Queen Elizabeth met with President Harry Truman

304
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,855
Father King George the sixth

305
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,231
7 hours of Queen Elizabeth

306
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,095
She was in attendance for a state dinner and even met with former president at the Waldorf Astoria

307
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,471
The 1959 Eisenhower would visit Volvo visit with Elizabeth again on her turf

308
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
In 1961

309
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
That was Richard Nixon president

310
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,647
In 1976 Elizabeth was invited to a grand celebration

311
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
Just after the bicentennial

312
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Okay

313
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Choose

314
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
And they're even famous pictures

315
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Dancing together

316
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
Has never forgotten its British Heritage

317
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,383
Rifai Wesley maybe inappropriate gesture of kissing on the lips

318
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
Much does a queen in everyone's disapproval

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
That was an international scandal

320
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,903
Everybody was

321
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Yeah I love that

322
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,559
Became the first president to stay the night there

323
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,911
You would return to visit

324
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
A1989 George h.w. Bush

325
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
When she visited

326
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
1991

327
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
In 1994 Bill Clinton worth

328
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
The UK

329
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Elizabeth

330
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
2001

331
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
And in 2000

332
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
3 he was the first

333
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
The Visitor

334
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Technically

335
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
A state visit

336
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,439
The specific definition is hard to nail down

337
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
To consult Tony Blair about the visit

338
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Having to consult with Tony Blair is

339
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
The worst sentence

340
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
But you can imagine

341
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
2009 the world was scandalized

342
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Michelle

343
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
Egregious than Carter's Behavior

344
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Mike Broyles protocol

345
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
There's a thing about you can't initiate contact

346
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,623
The queen

347
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
And she has to initiate that car

348
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
Isn't that I meant maybe he will be

349
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Maybe he will be once a day

350
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
I could see that r g

351
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
President not literally

352
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
Nixon vice president

353
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
Meet with the queen during the years that she's been alive

354
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
And on the throne

355
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Is LBJ

356
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
He is the only President and most likely that is only because of schedules

357
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
It because the Vietnam War

358
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
Those are the only president

359
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
All of those people pretty much

360
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
I have a god-like with

361
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Very cute

362
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,775
Have gone and visited the queen

363
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
It's crazy

364
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
He's also talking about

365
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Because he's like

366
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,943
He's trying to make this seem like some sort of

367
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Real scandal

368
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
So

369
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
Answer the question of bowing I would like to say

370
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,207
This this is interesting story of George HW Bush's present

371
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Play the stupidest fake outrage

372
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
Very soon after he was inaugurated

373
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,679
To attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito Hirohito

374
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
Is a very complicated situation leader during World War

375
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,223
Funeral of his enemies leader

376
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,063
Leader of our country

377
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
It's very complicated dynamic

378
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
Bush attended that funeral procession

379
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
The casket

380
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
80

381
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
The casket

382
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
The deceased emperor

383
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
When he was asked about if you made the point that it was a sign of respect

384
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
U.s. is now

385
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Friendswood

386
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
Customary

387
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
In Japanese culture

388
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
Respect to our now Ally and friend

389
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
After that she was roundly criticized by the right for battling to anyone

390
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
Because some picadillos up

391
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
Are evergreen it was an attack Bush back then for this

392
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Alex

393
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Now to use this

394
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
To attack Obama

395
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
I just for fun

396
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
When I was looking into this I found a hilarious collection of pictures of Eisenhower balance

397
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
It's

398
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Crazy

399
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Keep out everybody

400
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
Pope John the 23rd to the wife of the Italian Prime Minister

401
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Do Greek Orthodox Archbishop

402
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Chicago's

403
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Of New York

404
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
Charles de Gaulle

405
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
About to everybody

406
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Eisenhower

407
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
Diplomatic politeness

408
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:01,567
Controversy

409
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Politeness

410
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,455
No it was a it was actually that he kept walking

411
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
In front of her

412
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
That's right

413
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Not done

414
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Carter kissed

415
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
The queen on the lips

416
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
Hilarious Wildside

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Although at the same time that

418
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,688
I know that it's not

419
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Romantic

420
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
Eli kiss on the cheek

421
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
European way but he went for the mouth

422
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
I don't know man

423
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,768
It's a weird piece of some sort of Foreign Relations history

424
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,864
All this is that like first of all

425
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,424
Everyone except for LBJ

426
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
That is not a big deal

427
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
And she's the presumptive head of the country

428
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Even though it's

429
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Imagine

430
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
It still let's have fun

431
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Or whatever

432
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
So there's that there's that

433
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
It's clearly just making bulshit up about

434
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
And then what

435
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
It's complete nonsense

436
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
He's just trying to score points

437
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
His version of it would be that like it's

438
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Showing deference

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Giving up our sovereign

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
L

441
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
Or something like that but

442
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Not really

443
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
So is shaking

444
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Just being polite

445
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Anyway

446
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Walking around with his dick out

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Slapping people

448
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
Really want

449
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Is that kind of a

450
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Idea that they have

451
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
What the American

452
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,952
Watch the video of Obama meeting

453
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
He doesn't bow

454
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,816
He gives a little bit of a head nod

455
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
It's not like

456
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
It's not at the shoulders

457
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
It's definitely not at the waist

458
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
But there is a little bit of

459
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Guess what

460
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,152
We're doing what ends up happening is very close to like Doffing your cat

461
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Greetings

462
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
It is not a scandal it is not dialing to the queen to show submission to the throne

463
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
Is kind of

464
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Fashion do that his

465
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,632
Did do a lot of research because

466
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
That argument of life

467
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
Like what

468
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Levels of

469
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
How people would interpret it

470
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
Department in the executive branch

471
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
About that

472
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
It keeps track

473
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,744
4 / 6

474
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,328
Yourself of diplomacy

475
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
So I

476
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,936
Obama's

477
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,520
Team telling him what's appropriate would you beat the queen

478
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
He was a he was a f****** like

479
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:18,944
State senator and he's not a royal

480
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
There's no reason to assume you've met a queen

481
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:26,624
I would have no idea how to handle myself without training if I were to meet a royal

482
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
I would call the scandal going to go with fist-bump Michelle did

483
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Papa Obama

484
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
I would say that

485
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
The final two

486
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Would be

487
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
HW throwing up on the Japanese

488
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,968
Prime minister prime minister

489
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Kissing the queen

490
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
What you going to go with

491
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
I would say Carter because

492
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
At least

493
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
With bush

494
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,208
Throwing up is almost always an involuntary

495
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,560
Apartment guide

496
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
But that's a panic

497
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Choice skyspace

498
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
I think so I think it's like

499
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Sure

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,664
The involuntary nature of it he might have been looking at him or whatever

501
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
You sometimes can be pretty of me

502
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,808
Could have not kissed

503
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Baby

504
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,488
Now I'm just imagining all the different ways

505
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
And the relatives

506
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
Is that better or worse than the prime

507
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Better

508
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Even yet

509
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Scandal

510
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,480
I don't know anyway let's move along because

511
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
We're still on this topic

512
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
On the 30th

513
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
Alex has Webster

514
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
I don't really interesting thing happened

515
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
Really having a conversation

516
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Webster Tarpley

517
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,888
He'd also been on the 29th

518
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Episode Sunday episode

519
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
I noticed that he was saying

520
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Exactly

521
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Things

522
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
To the point where I thought Alex

523
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Just playing

524
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
The interview from here

525
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
I've been pretending he was in studio

526
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
It's not

527
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,576
He's just saying the exact same things over and over again

528
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Exactly

529
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,120
The Masterpiece you're going to end up getting awards for this

530
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,984
The two of them have a little bit of a bull session about this

531
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Idea of Obama going to

532
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Meet the queen

533
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
And Tarpley said something

534
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Not good

535
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Being received

536
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,112
April 20th April 1st is not the next day

537
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
March 31st

538
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
He's practicing

539
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
The first sitting US president

540
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
My friend

541
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,248
Which According to which Obama

542
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:39,648
You could make him ineligible for the

543
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,024
But why

544
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
About whether he's qualified to be the president

545
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,960
Herbalife

546
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
The American

547
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Isambard in the sky

548
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
I got a hunch

549
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,616
Webster Tarpley stand by that

550
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
I bet

551
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Silberg

552
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
To check into that

553
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,392
I don't give a s*** 0

554
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
You talk much about it

555
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Probably could just be sad like

556
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
Fairly similar to Stephen The Obama Deception

557
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
So after this Alex has

558
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Call Lynn

559
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Ron Paul

560
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
And all that s***

561
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,176
Apparently a couple days prior Luca daseke had been sent

562
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
The Clique

563
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
He got arrested

564
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Because

565
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
He was I don't know

566
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
I don't I don't talk

567
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,672
I can care about the story I'll be partially on it I'm just going to play

568
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
This clip

569
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Where Luke explains his arrest

570
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
Because I want to play the clip after this

571
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
Years Lukas planing what happened to him I don't think this is accurate at all

572
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
But whatever

573
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Surprise

574
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,080
Thank you and your listeners for calling into the police station last night

575
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
Call my friend Anthony and Manny

576
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,736
They're listening to the police officer talking over about the press pass on how they wanted to

577
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
Are charged me with having a fake person who was your callers who was you that's called in and got the

578
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Call Jimmy with criminal

579
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:22,048
Price guide for walking into a hotel nothing else I was never asked to leave

580
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,936
I walked into the hotel and as soon as I did I was on the third floor I was immediately

581
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
Aidid by Bloomberg personal security guard

582
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Air police intelligence

583
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
How's brought downstairs

584
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,456
When I was broke downstairs I was told I was detained I asked him why am I being detained why

585
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
What's the probable cause

586
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,832
Police intelligence by me

587
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
Then the police intelligence got the police officers

588
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
This kid won't leave

589
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,536
Can I please leave can I please get out of here can I please go home

590
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,632
Do you see here they went to the other police officers and they said

591
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:04,032
He won't leave when we trying to leave I was already on the first floor of the real

592
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
What's going on here most likely is just misunderstanding what had

593
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,832
Get a fake press pass wasn't recognized by this

594
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
And so he was not considered

595
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
Depressed he had no reason to be there it was a fundraiser

596
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Probably take

597
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Guess you have to pay unless you're part of the day

598
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Legitimate

599
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
Passing there

600
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,264
Other people

601
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
It wasn't about when they said

602
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
You're detained

603
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,152
Endure whatever before

604
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,272
Because I do I know a bit about

605
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
He yells a lot I don't know anything about Luke

606
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
Spotify

607
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
That Bloomberg people

608
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Did not know who Luke rudowski

609
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Probably not

610
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,728
And one of his trademark saying

611
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Busy screaming

612
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
Based on the fact that I have no evidence to the contrary

613
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
There when he was told his press pass was no good

614
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
He probably yelled about how I a press

615
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,576
Something like that kind of in his character

616
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
I'm not entirely sure anyway I don't believe his version of the story it's not it seems like nonsense to me

617
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
What is the setup of the story

618
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
The version that Luke wants to

619
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,264
To tell only played it so I can play this next clip where Alex

620
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Telling Luke

621
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
To quit

622
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,248
Don't you got to talk to you about of being apart of his movement

623
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:55,136
Already Glory you guys have the last case of died mysteriously

624
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
You know that this was an official press event Bloomberg fundraiser that other press people

625
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
For attending

626
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,800
A year-and-a-half ago they already tried to say you had a bomb in your camera

627
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,248
Go ahead and do what you're doing if you want

628
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
Rustic mushrooms

629
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
I'm staying

630
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
Of the area that you're entering here

631
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
They don't they don't care

632
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Okay thank God we are bombs on you all I'm telling you is

633
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
I'm telling you

634
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,456
In Warfare and Infowars there's a certain time to break off things

635
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,856
You're going to be hell to try to get you out of this

636
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,400
Senator Prescott

637
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
You would have left if they told you to leave like you always do I know I'm standing there turning up

638
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Sort of

639
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
My issues

640
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
This seems like an Alex who has his Humanity intact

641
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
More than

642
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,864
Present-day well-liked on our Friday episode last week we heard him

643
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,192
Having a complete breakdown

644
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,264
Anymore

645
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,128
Thank you feels really bad about the world he is introduced lucrative ski into

646
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,688
Does lew-port house keys very inspired by Alex

647
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:00,320
Considers himself mini Alex Jones Young Young Gun Alex Jones out there on the streets

648
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,440
No not great. I think what you're hearing Express there is Alex feeling a little bit of guilt

649
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
And and and

650
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,840
That Luke is going to get himself in bigger trouble and then you'll have to feel bad about it

651
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Never

652
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Evernote

653
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
How

654
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
We do an episode in the present

655
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
I guess coincidence

656
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Our very next episode

657
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
In the past he just needs it is weird

658
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,832
Parallels and discrepancies Wild

659
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
Serrapeptase

660
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,792
In the past

661
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
And a very unfair one

662
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,728
It is Interstate yet

663
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Kill people

664
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
It's insane to see like how

665
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,088
Sort of similar stimulus and response

666
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
In different time

667
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Other hand

668
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
There is a certain amount of

669
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Luke

670
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
Paternal relationship

671
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Where is Gavin

672
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Did not accept

673
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,008
So part of Alex

674
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Which is

675
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
Bananas

676
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Come from like

677
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
This is

678
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Clear

679
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Where is Gavin's

680
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
But I think that's why Alex

681
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Can fuel hose

682
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
That's probably why he is able to access the ocean

683
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,768
Because Luke has willingly a at Power

684
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
I think it's possible that I was just can't

685
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Contextualize relation

686
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,424
I'm just outside of the Safari Zone

687
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,056
Subordinate

688
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
It is next clip

689
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
We get to catch up

690
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
He's as old as Alec

691
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
May 30th probably

692
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Big Brothers 35

693
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,584
I don't remember the guys name doesn't

694
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Three-player Italy

695
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,008
These two Sacramento

696
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,568
Because I got a big narrative cooking

697
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
In Sacramento

698
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
About

699
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
How there's a homeless Camp there

700
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
And Arnold Schwarzenegger

701
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
Has come in and said that

702
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
These people that are living

703
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,648
Need to be taken to the fairground

704
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
And Alex

705
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Who created this as

706
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Proto thema

707
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
I assumed it was more about the relevance of the sack

708
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
Kings to the NBA that

709
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Do with

710
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Arnold

711
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Schwarzenegger

712
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
Governor of California

713
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Proto thema

714
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
Is how I solved

715
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,064
The fact that Alex owned Arnold exposed.com

716
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
What that's about

717
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,952
Okay he's decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing a trial run of Civic

718
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,560
With his Tent City in Sacramento and he is dispatched

719
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
Incompetent

720
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,752
Arnold visit

721
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Nobody

722
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616
Okay he had gone down there

723
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
About Arnold with an approved

724
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
The mayor of Sacramento

725
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Power Air Force

726
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,720
About Alex's narrative

727
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
And where he's getting

728
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
The ideas

729
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
I can track those down

730
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Exactly

731
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
How can I know exactly why

732
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,472
Cares about your so excited

733
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
You love getting the exact Source correct

734
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
Here is Alex

735
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
Having a little chat with Rob.

736
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Lavender egg

737
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
From Sacramento

738
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
Why do tell me about your experience when you got in the Los Angeles what you saw there

739
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
I'm in Sacramento

740
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,232
Oh by the way I don't think I have another guide

741
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
And the other guy is from

742
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
Those were all the homeless people hang out

743
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Nobody there

744
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
Are you f****** kidding me

745
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,496
Jacob Skid Row 2009

746
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:39,616
Nightmare Zone

747
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
Cataract Vicky

748
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,576
Novella

749
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,328
And the Sacramento Mayor saying

750
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
Tough love you can't just live out here intense

751
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
We're going to make you go

752
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,032
Is more about the fact that they didn't have running water and sanitation out there it was a public health

753
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
California

754
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
Tell Alex that I don't think they're going to go quietly

755
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,296
Everything the people that we've been talkin to hear they they

756
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,624
Don't plan on going to this Expo El Expo Center

757
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
They're very

758
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,024
They really they don't get a lot of information or feedback from

759
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,120
The mayor of the city that they just come down all the sudden and tell them things

760
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
And

761
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,776
It is a real interesting environment that everybody that we met so far has been really nice

762
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,848
These people just want to live here and be left alone

763
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
And

764
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,248
You know it's right at the edge of town and you go right over some railroad tracks for a levee is

765
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
And you can see there's at least

766
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:57,696
It just wants one little area there's at least 310th kind of spread out over a few acre

767
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
There's a massive embellishment of

768
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,680
There are places like in Portland I believe it's called dignity City or something like that where they have

769
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Play

770
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:14,848
Resources that are available porta potties running

771
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
Like times in Camp

772
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
This is not one of those

773
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Situation

774
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
This is just

775
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
Bunch of people living in tents

776
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
In relative squalor

777
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,696
People are like we shouldn't trees out back

778
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
It's deeply dangerous

779
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,352
And then also you have the possibility for

780
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,448
The exploited

781
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
For disaster

782
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
Yeah I don't understand what

783
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
It's going to take

784
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
To get

785
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
People

786
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
To recognize

787
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
The homeless

788
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
Being homeless

789
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
Is a public health

790
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
Disaster for you as

791
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
There's so much

792
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Mitigated

793
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Disease

794
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:10,144
Skid-row there was an outbreak

795
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Because of because

796
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,592
High-density

797
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Taking care of

798
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
People is also

799
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Taking care of

800
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:28,320
Then good about the people themselves

801
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Here's the thing

802
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
Pointed out that everyone was really nice

803
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
They're trying to present this image

804
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
These are a

805
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Kind of homeless

806
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
People that hang out at this Tent City

807
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
Alex

808
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,104
He's going to express it

809
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
Integrating them into this hellhole taking their basic

810
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,967
Fairgrounds

811
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,527
Is why can't they saying they're going to be for sin

812
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
Alarm Center not going to go

813
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,719
If they they said they try to force them into they're going to say no and they're either going to grab what they can grab and move

814
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
Farther back into the wood

815
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
The right there really quick I'm sorry I cut you off make

816
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
The point that he was gone

817
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
He isn't like

818
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Exact response

819
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
To that question

820
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
But no one is forcing

821
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Anybody

822
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Two forces in we won't go

823
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,599
No I just completely missed

824
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
The

825
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
Implication

826
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
I'm saying

827
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
That they are nice

828
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
It's because

829
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
You say what

830
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Different

831
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Well this isn't what you would expect

832
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
Homeless people we assume that homeless people are

833
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
People like

834
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
But then there's also like what

835
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Part and parcel of the they're nice

836
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Alex

837
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
Resent this image

838
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
The people in this Tent City

839
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
The Working Poor

840
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
Yeah yeah

841
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,879
People would use Hoovervilles

842
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
Yeah this idea that they all they're doing is trying to

843
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:46,303
For a little while to get a downpayment for a house

844
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,143
Becky's legitimately same time which is first of all

845
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,983
I mean even if you don't know anything about that situation that's crazy

846
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,847
If maybe getting a month's rent or something like that

847
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Conceivable

848
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
A downpayment on a house

849
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,295
I'm just going to go live in the city for a few months

850
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,927
To get about 50 unemployed

851
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,511
Try to get back on my feet get a job so I can get a downpayment on a house

852
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,887
Absurd

853
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
But

854
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Alex has an ulterior motive

855
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
An operation and the reason

856
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
Is it to get to the bottom of the story

857
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
They didn't to help anybody

858
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
It's to get footage for his new.

859
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,927
Call you tomorrow late in the evening we're going to take off I think about 6:30 at night

860
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
I need YouTube

861
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,543
I need you to manufacture the reality I need for my new documentary

862
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
These people

863
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
Continue to do this

864
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,247
Absolutely

865
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
For me to make whatever argument I'm going to make

866
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,623
More to the story but this is where it leaves off on

867
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
The 30th

868
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Let me get back to it on the 3rd

869
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
31st Iowa

870
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Explain

871
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
But for now

872
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
Alex jump

873
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,655
He gets to

874
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
Next clip Alex

875
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
Expresses exactly what I do

876
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
And I was waiting for

877
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,271
Your actions and others

878
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
That's the psychology

879
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
For the moment he would take responsibility for getting the language taken out of the belt

880
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
To discredit he hasn't

881
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
He's literally saying we got it taken out last week because of your hard work and are getting the word out

882
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:13,247
They were forced to get rid of this enslavement language

883
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,599
You bet you

884
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
The listeners but

885
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
Manager

886
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,231
To get this language taken out of the building

887
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,863
Before you knew it was this

888
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
It's awesome you take these ingredients

889
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,727
It's like soda

890
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Flower

891
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Yeah couple things

892
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
You make bread in the same way

893
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
In the past

894
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
The durian

895
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
What is the flower

896
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:56,255
It's that you've taken out with about it

897
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,327
So you add the baking soda which is lying about the timeline

898
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
And now you got that

899
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,727
Propaganda

900
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
But when is it ever

901
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Let's make

902
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Let's

903
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
Anyway

904
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
Siemens

905
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Crusade against soy

906
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
And he's going to have a guest on talking about the

907
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
Her name is Karen Russo

908
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
She works for an organization

909
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
About that revolves around

910
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
She wants to talk about real

911
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Yeah cuz she's

912
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Actually working to stop

913
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Abuse is in prison

914
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Isaac

915
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015
I know enough about her that I'm going to give her like a stamp of approval

916
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,623
I didn't see any red flags

917
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
That you usually do without

918
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
Episode

919
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Alex

920
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
Keep trying to steer her towards toy

921
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,399
And she's just

922
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
What's talked about how like prisoners died

923
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:15,871
Just boil it down for his research on the radio talking about

924
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Prisons

925
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,087
What's wrong with that

926
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,695
Estrogen

927
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,047
Call Tabitha.

928
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,031
It is a small issue that I cover that she's a different direction that isn't about

929
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
He's already

930
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
There

931
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
He's already there with the negative

932
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Treatment of

933
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Prison

934
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Why can't you

935
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
You just fold reality

936
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
You know just like

937
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
Throw-in guess what they're also mystery

938
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
This way

939
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,071
Has a rampage against

940
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,935
She's having a conversation about

941
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
In their throne

942
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
Really

943
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
You're more than welcome to do that but

944
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
He's doing it it makes me feel

945
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Feel like

946
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
She really wants to get this

947
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,015
It's what he wants this interview

948
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
Here in this next clip

949
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
He steers her towards it again

950
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
I am the middle of it

951
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
Going back to Karen Rusev

952
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Adele hit on the diet

953
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,655
Moana and I wanted

954
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
0 in on a couple of stats

955
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
Just so people can kind of get a handle on the number

956
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
We're talking about here

957
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
We are

958
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
The only country in the world that incarcerated

959
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:57,247
Many human beings that is correct there are two point three million folks locked up in a jail or prison today

960
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,623
In addition to that 2.3 million are on probation and parole

961
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
7 points

962
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
4 million

963
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
CBS News

964
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
You can do with anything

965
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Statistics

966
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
And I'm a real stickler for this

967
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
Even with my client

968
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
Statistics

969
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,759
He almost seems disappointed that the number isn't familiar

970
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
2% blue

971
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
It's lower than a number that I've introduced every possible number then

972
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,375
It doesn't work for me

973
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,191
No 95

974
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
Do you like to talk about but I have more important issue

975
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
I want to get to

976
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
This flavor the

977
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
The entire

978
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
Is what kind of leads me to think that maybe she's not as crazy

979
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
Is interested in

980
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
Is he selling

981
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Food

982
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:16,095
I'm guessing that cuz while I was gone through

983
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
There's like one

984
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,471
Throw-in actual issues and get people motivated and there's

985
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Is of course

986
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
He has to demonize Soy

987
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,335
So he can sell his

988
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Maybe cuz

989
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
Come Direct

990
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
Cuz you know I only put

991
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Testosterone

992
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
My balls directly in

993
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Beef testosterone

994
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
And then to

995
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Because

996
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,535
If you start talkin about realshit peep

997
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
People are going to want to do

998
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,631
Responsible

999
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
In this clip

1000
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
I kind of

1001
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,079
Started to get the feeling that maybe she wasn't so

1002
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
Cool but good point poorly

1003
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,967
And then Alex comes in

1004
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
He doesn't care

1005
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
This isn't about black people but

1006
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
It's sad

1007
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
Every time an inmate gets let loose

1008
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
And he's got HIV

1009
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
HGTV

1010
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
TV

1011
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Mirka

1012
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
Meningitis

1013
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,519
You name it every time they're released. Here it is going to affect you

1014
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,335
Next time you run through a fast-food thing

1015
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
Understand

1016
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Washing the dishes

1017
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:37,247
That's the point that I think that she's making very poorly

1018
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
I get but that's not the way

1019
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,111
Trying to get the audience and Alex to understand

1020
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
What the issues

1021
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
You and hurting

1022
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
Can hurt you

1023
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,423
If that's the Baseline of getting you to understand

1024
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,287
Articulates with behind it is not like a

1025
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Text yourself or mobile

1026
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
People are prisoners

1027
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
It is a treat people better

1028
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
I'm all right with that

1029
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
So if we have somebody in

1030
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
In prison

1031
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
Who has meningitis

1032
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
It's going to

1033
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,487
Every other prisoner

1034
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,047
We have 2.4

1035
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
2.3 million people

1036
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
Prison bus apiece is

1037
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Incarcerating

1038
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
We're spreading

1039
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
Disease

1040
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
They're going to be

1041
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
That disease

1042
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,175
You're talking about

1043
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
Is that exactly where Alex picks things up

1044
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,623
Journal

1045
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
But you never see it in the news massive drug-resistant TB from illegal aliens

1046
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
Australian

1047
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
I understand spreading it's spreading out everybody

1048
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:04,287
So she even think about

1049
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,335
Talking about people like you and me

1050
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
Pointers that were incarcerated so many

1051
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
People who shouldn't be

1052
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,527
Adequately

1053
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,319
Her argument still

1054
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,415
Well articulated that as well as I would like it does there are strong and

1055
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
Indications of the she's not on the same tip is out

1056
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Interesting

1057
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,559
You know just another little

1058
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
Piece of bigotry and then a weird

1059
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
Out of nowhere Rampage

1060
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,215
Because he has not brought up at all

1061
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,055
In the time that I've been listening to that I could 2009-2018

1062
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
Search

1063
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Fight

1064
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,407
It is also a law

1065
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
The things you said

1066
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Eating soy

1067
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,807
I think I agree with you in that

1068
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,343
So far she is kind of

1069
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Push back on

1070
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,135
Demonizing

1071
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Which is why

1072
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
Her point is

1073
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Poorly in that

1074
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
Demonizing

1075
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
Equal

1076
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Because they're in there working

1077
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
If you're not very smart

1078
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,031
It could be heard as an argument that you should be afraid of these sick people

1079
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,591
Being let out of prison

1080
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Prison

1081
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
If she was a little bit

1082
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Closer with language

1083
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Made that point.

1084
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,391
We're going to talk about her and that's the end

1085
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Can we go on

1086
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,303
Because as we know Alex is super against

1087
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,839
The bank

1088
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,631
That had to be bailed out

1089
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Giving bonuses

1090
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,799
Head of the John Birch Society on his show

1091
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
McManus made

1092
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Who cares

1093
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
These companies

1094
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:52,063
That's the government Alex

1095
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
That is absolutely

1096
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
Now just a couple days later what does he say

1097
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,079
A joke

1098
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
Alex

1099
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,711
I don't understand

1100
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
It's less

1101
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
It appears

1102
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,135
It appears that it's less of like a changing of his

1103
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Morals as it is

1104
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
An absence of any

1105
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
He has someone who he

1106
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
Built himself to be

1107
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,071
Hierarchy

1108
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
Totem pole

1109
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,543
Is McManus was like why should you

1110
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
You tell private companies

1111
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,199
Take contracts to build FEMA camp totals

1112
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
There's nothing behind any

1113
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
Get someone with high status around him and it was agree with

1114
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
I mean

1115
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Disagree with

1116
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
Automatic

1117
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,351
Bike for sport

1118
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:12,191
News on the 31st and that is that the president

1119
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
General Motors

1120
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
Aftermath

1121
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
You should step

1122
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
Because of

1123
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
Gianna

1124
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
Crippled the Auto industry

1125
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Had to step in

1126
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
And make some solvent

1127
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
And that sort of thing

1128
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,159
Everyone went Buckwild in the story was that Obama fired

1129
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,303
That doesn't track in terms of him just saying

1130
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
He resigns

1131
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
That's a choice you made

1132
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
And job

1133
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,471
So here's Alex talking about Obama fired

1134
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
Obama.com

1135
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,503
Staggering spectacle

1136
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,367
I'm a sitting president

1137
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,023
Shocked

1138
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Effective firing

1139
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
You're not really saying

1140
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,215
Didn't fire that

1141
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,751
This guy until GM

1142
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
To fire him

1143
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
Anything like that

1144
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Just fun use of language.

1145
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
To demonize somebody

1146
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
Kind of boring actually

1147
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,831
Maybe that's better than

1148
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,135
You know I mean if if Obama says hey

1149
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,719
0 consequences whatsoever other than

1150
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,815
Parachute

1151
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
Naval bombers like

1152
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,911
Hey guess what we're investigating you and now you're going to go

1153
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,007
Call your company but you're going to

1154
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Something like that

1155
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
I don't know

1156
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,103
I'm not really interested in the narrative I think it's

1157
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,479
Just another way of pointing the finger at Obama unfairly

1158
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
Mel

1159
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Get another guy

1160
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
One of our favorites

1161
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
The guy who sells

1162
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,743
Marty Schechter president

1163
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,071
Dropped by the show

1164
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
And he doesn't have a limerick

1165
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,423
He has a limerick that one of Alex Jones

1166
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,335
Phone calls we get there

1167
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
Email

1168
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,151

00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
Young man of world-renowned

1178

Party endorsements

1179
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
Gave me hope

1180
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703

School Bus sized are I convert water converter

1203
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815

It was an old man of Nantucket

1216
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,351
That is far as the bucket

1217
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Nantucket

1218
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,703
Follow the pair to Port.

1219
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,519
Girl with a bucket

1220
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,311

Banana apple

1224
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,599
A man and the man

1225
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,647
Stole the money and ran

1226
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439

1227
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463

AAA limerick

1230
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,871

01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Limerick

1233
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,991
Took me like

1234
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,039
Two to three times listening to it to be like

1235
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,599
What are you saying

Renee

Lord Byron is here giving us a limerick about a bucket I would prefer to redo some of his pubes

1240
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,407
Dangerous territory when you're doing a limerick it it starts

1241
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,759
The dick so long you can suck it

1242
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
The real urge to say f*** it

1243
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,855
You're there so many

1244
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,159
It's just Street limericks

1245
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,951
Don't start with Nantucket

1246
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,535
In Endwell

1247
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327

Listener and it was about

1255
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
He's so busy

1256
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,927
And then we came in with that

1257
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Really long leg

1258
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815

01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,863
Do anything but Stay classy

1260
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,703
You're something else

1261
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,287
Close to the closest

1262
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Alex could ever get to David Letter

1263
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
Hey Daddy

1264
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,199

01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527

Narrative

1273
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Here is where we'll figure out

1274
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
Really going on

1275
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Alex

1276
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,871
Clear that these are people trying to

1277
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Dubai houses

1278
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,623
Governor

Once can you

1283
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,927
Regular

1284
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,255
To raise enough money to get a downpayment on a house

1285
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,607
Apartment

1286
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
A deposit the pet deposit

1287
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
Ludacris presentation

1288
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Another story

1289
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,359
But that's already kind of world we lived in

1290
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
The coverage

1291
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
The last time

1292
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919

01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
Even talk to that other dude

Jason something-or-other

1296
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,087
Who's down there he's a guy from LA to

1297
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,623
Claims there's no homeless people rap

1298
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
Or some s***

1299
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,927
And we get

1300
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,951
Another character

1301
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
We get another homeless character

1302
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
In this Saga

1303
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
And he's going to

1304
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Be used as

1305
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
Horribly

1306
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Exploitative

1307
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
Prop

1308
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
Use him as such

1309
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,751
I have no evidence

1310
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
And using a massage

1311
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
I think Alex has good intentions

1312
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
You are high

1313
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,967
You know we just talked to a guy that got his

1314
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,039
He got pulled over and because he didn't have insurance on his

1315
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
New Winnebago

1316
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,463
They took all of his belongings everything he owned and let them out on the side of the street

1317
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
Somebody pointed out

1318
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
City and said you know

1319
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,351
Camping out over there

1320
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
And for that he made his way over here

1321
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,727
How much will it be

1322
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,103
He was saying it was about $1,000

1323
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Okay

1324
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,319
I can't afford that important

1325
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,439
Are they going to make him show up with insurance

1326
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
In order for them to get it out today

1327
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
Lyr you money

1328
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:02,431
Get that

1329
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,527
I will pay $1,000 to get the Winnebago out

1330
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
I am such a great guy

1331
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,927
This is key footage for the film

1332
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,303
Giving away what your motivations are

1333
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,839
Andaz

1334
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,143
Completely altruistic gesture

1335
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,191
I'm going to get his Winnebago out

1336
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,335
Pay for one month

1337
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
Most likely

1338
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,687
But that's not cute

1339
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
CI we got a situation

1340
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Here where

1341
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Alex

1342
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
And

1343
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
This next clip I think she'll give you a sense

1344
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
What's going on here

1345
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,023
Has every reason to believe that this guy.

1346
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:59,263
Get insurance get this off the road and

1347
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:03,103
Illegal

1348
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,783
Expired driver's license

1349
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,087
There's two police cars

1350
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,159
Winnebago

1351
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
Do you see the dichotomy is presented it's very similar to the dichotomy he was presenting earlier about the ID

1352
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
View

1353
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,655
These people in the Tent City are nice

1354
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,727
And they're good they're just trying to get money together to buy

1355
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,519
Arnold Schwarzenegger is going

1356
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
Force them in with the other

1357
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,359
The homeless people who are drug addict

1358
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Crazy

1359
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:13,503
And all this stuff you hear this guy got his Winnebago taken and Alex

1360
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,807
Not an illegal alien

1361
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,367
He's trying to create these divisions

1362
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Category

1363
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Yep now

1364
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Hear the tears were this isn't

1365
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,255
Here we find ourselves at the end of March

1366
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
2009

1367
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,839
Whole Hog

1368
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,911
Schwarzenegger forcing homeless people into a County Fairgrounds

1369
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Which according to Alex's

1370
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
The first runner for the people

1371
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:39,359
Easy to see how we make a connection but it's really important to take a look at the reality of the situation

1372
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
To see how he's lying about a couple things

1373
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,967
He's actually being tricked into

1374
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
Supporting a cup

1375
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Couple others

1376
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
This all started back to beginning of March

1377
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,391
Reporter Lisa Ling to Sacramento

1378
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
Cover the homeless Tent City

1379
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
The reporting was incredibly flawed

1380
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
And based on a fundamentally incorrect premise

1381
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,887
Namely that the people living in the time city were newly homeless

1382
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,959
The reason for misreporting isn't easy enough to see

1383
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,519
It's a catchy hook for a story and over called them

1384
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,055
Quote new face of homeless

1385
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,383
The noble working for lost it all in the recession

1386
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
The problem is that this wasn't even close

1387
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,991
True for the vast majority of the people living in

1388
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
Sin City

1389
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
The Bay Area News

1390
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Quotes

1391
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,391
With foreclosure rates in the Sacramento region among the highest in the nation

1392
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,975
Is a symbol of the economic meltdown

1393
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,559
People who lost their homes and we're suddenly pitching tents along the riverbed

1394
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
The truth is somewhat less dramatic

1395
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:38,239
Although sliver of the roughly 200 Tent City residents are recently middle-class people who lost their home

1396
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,079
The overwhelming majority eighty-two 90% by several estimates

1397
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,383
I've been homeless for years even decades

1398
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
Our reporting Reuters was even more

1399
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
You're saying quote

1400
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:52,831
A closer examination of the site including interviews of Camp residents and police officers

1401
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:59,231
Patrol the area turned up little if any evidence recession refugees were living among The Chronic

1402
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
We homeless there

1403
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,607
Fifty-five-year-old Tent City resident John kranitz commented on the influx

1404
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:08,703
The reporters covering the tent city after it was featured on Oprah quotes

1405
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
They don't want to talk to

1406
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,287
They're searching for people who just lost their home

1407
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
Countertop the movie

1408
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103
Lose a home when you've never owned one

1409
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,431
Sorry most of the people here been homeless for a long time

1410
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,247
Oprah's report included a bogus statistic

1411
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,295
Make a 1,200 people were living in Tent City

1412
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
When in reality

1413
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,391
That was the number of homeless total in Sacramento

1414
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
And the number is a tent city

1415
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Between 1 and 2

1416
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,559
You say there's no way that

1417
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,239
1 and 200 / 300

1418
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
That's nonsense

1419
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
The advocacy director for Loaves and Fishes

1420
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
Has commented on the situation

1421
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Quotes

1422
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,319
The media are trying to capture a very complex situation

1423
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,111
We've had homelessness in this country

1424
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
For decades

1425
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,927
Each person has their own circumstance

1426
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,487
You have to tease that out

1427
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,023
If you're going to address the problem

1428
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,839
Why do why do we care so much for people who suffer

1429
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,399
Prefer short time versus those who suffer for a long time

1430
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
What's that about

1431
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,215
The media store

1432
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,799
Easy human-interest story

1433
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,823
The issue of homelessness

1434
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,383
All they did is create a fictional narrative it was a

1435
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
Florida by Marriott

1436
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,943
Different forces

1437
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,223
Push their own agenda

1438
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,039
People who wanted to attack Obama could use a story

1439
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
Creepy image of modern Hoovervilles

1440
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,415
People who wanted to attack Bush could save this horror was all his fault

1441
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:36,511
People like Alex could use it to argue the quote good hard-working people were being forced

1442
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,071
None of this reflected reality

1443
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,167
Schwarzenegger wasn't even behind the plan you just approve it because the governor

1444
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
Cuz he was the governor of California

1445
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,495
Who's mayor Kevin Johnson

1446
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,287
Who is the one who's making the plan

1447
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,103
Including setting up a homelessness task force

1448
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
I haven't

1449
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,223
David which included input input from people like John credit Ray

1450
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,807
The plan was not to shut down the tent city and move them into a Fairground

1451
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
There's also at 8

1452
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,415
180000 dollar package that was approved

1453
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,719
To add beds to existing homeless shelters

1454
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,255
And create additional shelters

1455
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
Plus offering retail Apartments

1456
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Approximately

1457
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
340 Edition

1458
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,863
Do people who are suffering

1459
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
Thomas Rhett

1460
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
What we have here

1461
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
Is the situation

1462
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Where

1463
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
Unfortunately

1464
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,895
The interesting element here is that the origin of this propaganda there it is a dollar

1465
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
It's Oprah

1466
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,479
Alex is certainly putting his own dishonesty

1467
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:32,831
But the underlying narrative

1468
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,135
BG's comes directly from Oprah

1469
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
Now the big

1470
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,719
The spas-12 we need to address

1471
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,255
Is it part and parcel how them

1472
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,071
Media with representing the story is that these were white homeless

1473
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,143
Of all the flight shows pictures I can find

1474
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,215
The images on all the articles about this density every

1475
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
The people featured are white

1476
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
See if even happening to us

1477
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
There's literally no way I would believe this is

1478
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,711
Subconsciously or consciously responding to

1479
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
And why you covering the story the way he

1480
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,599
Absolutely

1481
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:09,183
People this guy with the Winnebago in what it would have been if he was an illegal

1482
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
Yeah all of it is because

1483
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Subconsciously

1484
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
I believe it's consciously on his part

1485
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
But what are you trying to do is to consciously

1486
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
Reinforced that suggests

1487
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
Listen to his audio

1488
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,959
These are the white

1489
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,751
And now they're being attacked

1490
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:28,639
It's a tall white identity shitz playing out through this this Tent City narrative

1491
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,431
The bigger picture of it

1492
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
We should be talking about

1493
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,783
You know Kevin Johnson the mayor

1494
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,831
Introverts and anger

1495
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
Making

1496
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,951
Good progress like this lady who runs Loaves and Fishes

1497
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,231
Even said that.

1498
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
This is a very positive but

1499
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,351
Unfortunately no one's going to be paying attention to this

1500
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
6 months

1501
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,143
Hopefully week

1502
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
You can get

1503
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,775
Putting a Band-Aid on a bigger wound

1504
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
Continue to Graterford

1505
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,127
I don't know

1506
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,943
The argument about the

1507
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Prince between Obama's

1508
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
Trumpsc

1509
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Look

1510
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,647
Obama is going to do

1511
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:19,583
You looked

1512
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
And he knows what's up

1513
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,447
Bring the white out of their throat

1514
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:30,335
Play around that cuz if I got applied Agency on Obama

1515
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,383
Even go that far just because

1516
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,431
You know it's easier to Dabangg

1517
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:39,807
It'll be more like his rhetoric would be more along the lines of Obama is allowing

1518
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
Does allows

1519
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,207
This happened to White

1520
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
It has

1521
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Pretty good confidence

1522
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
He's going to

1523
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,839
Checked the white people over all others

1524
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,143
You know I think you can

1525
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
I think you can

1526
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,703
Very clearly

1527
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:01,311
The argument the only argument that really is Meaningful here

1528
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103
Is how much of this is

1529
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,687
Alex intentionally guiding his programming

1530
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
Towards that

1531
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Riling up

1532
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Fostering

1533
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
White

1534
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,183
Identity believe right and how much of it is just what he believes

1535
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,719
And that's how he sees them

1536
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,511
Not even realize

1537
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
You know like

1538
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
The only thing that's important because one

1539
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,679
Is a white nationalist demagogue

1540
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,263
Does demagogue

1541
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,311
Poorly interpreting the news

1542
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
You know I don't

1543
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,383
I don't think it matters in the end

1544
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,503
With with that kind of

1545
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
I mean

1546
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,343
With the way that we're now understanding

1547
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
In his heyday

1548
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Upbringing

1549
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
The books that

1550
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
Red

1551
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,023
Quotes

1552
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,447
But there's that there's no way

1553
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
2

1554
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
There's no way for me to accept

1555
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
That his

1556
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Is white supremacy

1557
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,847
Is not Atlee

1558
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,271
There's no way for me to say that it's

1559
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
I can't prove that it's all conscious and

1560
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
Purpose

1561
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:23,743
Never believe that there is not a Consciousness that he is

1562
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
Preparing

1563
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
It's it's it's not

1564
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
The water's edge

1565
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,263
I go back and forth

1566
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,103
Possibly not know what you're doing

1567
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
It's not like Coach Dave

1568
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:50,623
You are a huge racist you don't realize the labels that you're talking about you're so stupid you don't have to

1569
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,903
You don't

1570
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
You're stupid

1571
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
You are also right

1572
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
How to invest

1573
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
And races

1574
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,095
The higher-order

1575
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,887
Is higher

1576
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
You playing a game

1577
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
Definitely know that whatever game he's playing at benefits whites more than n

1578
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,759
This whole

1579
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
Baby story is really fat

1580
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
I'm really glad

1581
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
To have gotten to dig into it a little

1582
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,183
The element of it like being

1583
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,791
What is responding to and furthering is the misreporting that

1584
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,095
Which is crazy cuz he f****** hate

1585
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,143
Right so he doesn't even realize that

1586
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
It is

1587
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,239
Taking a cobra plant germinated

1588
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,847
I didn't realize it Oprah

1589
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
Was irregular

1590
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:49,247
Anytime I want my read-o-matic

1591
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:55,647
Confirm or clues that her intentions and Lisa Ling's intentions

1592
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,951
Of course we're good but lazy of course

1593
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
Maybe it's like

1594
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
Fudge a little bit hero beat

1595
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:08,191
Not as thorough as we should because it makes a better story and at the end of the day what's the outcome of that story hopefully more

1596
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,727
People caring about the homeless

1597
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,775
So like I could that confuse

1598
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
There

1599
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
Rationale for whatever

1600
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:20,224
Positive

1601
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
Screw this one up

1602
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,368
Or is like they realize that their daytime demographic was

1603
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
Super white women

1604
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,952
Who knows that it is hard to save

1605
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
Now lying

1606
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
I think it's good it's very easy

1607
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
But

1608
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:49,920
It's also

1609
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
Because he has to

1610
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
British guy that is

1611
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Is disposal

1612
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,504
And their related

1613
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
Steve Watson

1614
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
Call Joseph

1615
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,392
Is related brother

1616
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,952
Brothers

1617
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:09,376
Designer goggles

1618
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:15,776
Do not remember cyc started coming on a urinalysis

1619
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
Before Paul Joseph Watson

1620
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,080
She is

1621
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Not as good

1622
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,152
Is Paul Paul is much more Starkey

1623
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
And has it

1624
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,712
How old are you

1625
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
Don't know that

1626
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:30,112
I don't know

1627
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:36,512
I don't know that to be the case

1628
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,352
Call Joseph

1629
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,896
If only because

1630
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
I think

1631
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:58,528
If I recall correctly someone sent me a picture of Paul and Steve

1632
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,296
Together

1633
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,648
It looks like an album cover

1634
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,744
Come on the show

1635
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Steve

1636
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:13,632
Said bunch of dumb s*** about the Queens

1637
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
He says most

1638
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
Who's on

1639
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
That made me feel so good

1640
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
Terrible

1641
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,040
Is the word terrible

1642
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,368
Thank you for indulging a first

1643
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,160
A perfect

1644
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:40,256
He comes in a narrative

1645
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
Obama's going to Bedford

1646
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,656
T20 is going to be a mess

1647
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Because it's at all

1648
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
So really all that interesting

1649
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Wow Alex has Steve on the line

1650
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
He reads

1651
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,152
An article from prisonplanet.com

1652
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944
Queen

1653
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,480
He does it in an insult

1654
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
British accent

1655
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:12,512
Here's the article Barack Obama's team

1656
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,560

1657
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,632
Rehearsing

1660
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
Protocol

1661
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:35,296
I know that this isn't a British accent

1662
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:40,160
It's it it's an article on his own website right

1663
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464
Probably Paul

1664
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,744
Probably

1665
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,048
Maybe Steve

1666
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
So he's

1667
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Reading

1668
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
The article in a very

1669
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,008
2 most likely

1670
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,664
It's rude and the Dynamics are weird there's no doubt about a huge I love that you

1671
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
You were sitting there trying to

His pronunciation

1673
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
Will you didn't realize

1674
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,672
Filter recognizing the moment is the pronunciation of that word is the impression

1675
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Adequate

1676
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:19,072
Oh that's a quick with how he launched into the word you could hear him

1677
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:24,448
Depression

1678
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,264
Decide

1679
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,616

Advisor Secret Service agents of Nevada jobs

Cavalcade

Azusa Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon

I know

1687
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:08,736
There is no

1688
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:16,160
What is real news at all

1689
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:20,768
There is a chance that is why put on The Voice in order

1690
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
Are where there is no

1691
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,096
It really all he's saying is like

1692
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:30,240
Obama is due diligence

1693
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,032
And then he's going to meet with the

1694
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,992
Gloria

1695
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,344
Actually

1696
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,416
Hey Steve

I told you that now

1698
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,936
Cowboy hat

1699
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:03,520
Elmer Fudd cartoon

1700
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,504
Get off my land boy

1701
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,672
Do you do you do got to have some fun

1702
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,976
Again

1703
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,096
Appropriate that he was playing Wipeout

1704
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,192
I got they got that's the most in

1705
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Consulting

1706
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
Really

1707
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,752
Child

1708
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:40,128
I think we've heard on those yet that like

1709
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
They don't like him

1710
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,528
Faucet does not like Alex no reply

1711
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
I can't do that right now

1712
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Yeah

1713
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
Pretty great

1714
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:59,584
Steve comes in to do their little

1715
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,400
Paul Joseph Watson

1716
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,472
Basically says the exact same thing

1717
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:09,056
More or less his argument is that there's going to be protest

1718
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
The G20

1719
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,640
But the protests are actually the globalist

1720
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
Secretly controlling

1721
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,736
Black Bloc groups

1722
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:22,112
And these are anarchists and these people in order to invalidate

1723
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Of the globalist

1724
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
Some stuff like that

1725
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Tortured

1726
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
It is

1727
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,000
But the only clip that I have

1728
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
Is Paul Joseph Watson

1729
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
My favorite catch

1730
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:34,656
Sonic coming from the very thought that saying is going to be a summer of Rage

1731
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:38,240
The summer

1732
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
So I'm not going to cut out everytime I forgot

1733
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,736
I mean to

1734
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Alex

1735
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
The Great British Empire

1736
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,440
He has white nationalist perspectives on the relief White

1737
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,512
Certainly Marty's got multiple limericks

1738
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,816
Bob Marley

1739
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,888
And Alex wants to

1740
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,960
Which is cool

1741
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,520
Which is great

1742
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
Play just called Marty

1743
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:22,528
He's also a medium

1744
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
He wanted to

1745
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
Would you like to read it

1746
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,792
Or would you like me to read

1747
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,864
Alex

1748
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,632
Alex

1749
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Thought

1750
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Free and clear

1751
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:42,240
So excited

1752
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
Cracked a beer

1753
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
With a limerick attack

1754
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
And Alex for once felt

1755
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
That's better than anything

1756
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,576
Documents

1757
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
I think so

1758
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
I don't I don't like limericks

1759
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,584
What type of power is absolutely

1760
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Anyway

1761
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,936
Andover 2009 Adventures

1762
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,960
Super interesting stuff

1763
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,240
Interesting developments

1764
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,056
I don't know what they stigma land bariatric

1765
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848

Oh also yes I looked into it this film it

1767
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,016

1769
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,624
Documentaries

1770
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
It is

1771
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,720
Torturous

1772
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,048
Two-and-a-half hour plus runtime

1773
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,376
He said he's going to put it out on the 4th of July

1774
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
He.

1775
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,704
It doesn't come out until later in the year

1776
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,264

1777

01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848

1782
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,904
