1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by I'm sick of imposing

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nick.com

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,464
Hey everybody

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Like sit around and talk

9
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
A little bit about Alex

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Indeed we are

11
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Dan

12
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
Jordan have you ever

13
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Physically Escape

14
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
I mean obviously if you'd been in prison before you

15
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
Brought it up

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,272
Before now I don't talk about that

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
I will say I have not escaped

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
Imprison I've never been in an escape room

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Although I would do that it's too but I don't want you out of character for me and someone who's kind of like

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
What's down upon me

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
Best.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Yeah

23
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
Probably would do one of those axe throwing things

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
What do you mean by that

25
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,224
If you never been there are places where you can throw axes you can throw axes

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
Sure sure

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Well let's do that sometime to make a list

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
Eventually every wall Falls to ask

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,424
Times when I've been like

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Exploring

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,824
Creeks and caves and stuff like that in in Central Missouri when I was growing up it at

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
I have feelings of like like

33
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Vague memories of

34
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Feeling like I was trapped

35
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
But I probably wasn't do probably just a like really childish

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,112
Panic mechanism

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,696
But I don't know I don't know quicksand

38
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
A lot of fears about of years ago

39
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,912
Generations and then we all found out that

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Not even that big

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
Good deal I guess what I'm not opening up to like natural phenomenon

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
There have been multiple times

43
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
But I was even younger than when I was in Missouri if I lived in Honolulu Hawaii times that I

44
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
I got caught in like

45
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Undertows

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
That is one of those like really scary

47
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
Just trying to jump around and waves

48
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
Is a giant wave

49
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
And you just get

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Caught

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
It's

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Remembering that was like as a like

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
9 year old videos

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,288
Escape

55
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
My God it's just like

56
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Feeling your body

57
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Ripped around by the water and likes

58
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
You you know to tread water you notice

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,136
You do those things and it doesn't

60
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Or if I know that's terrible

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
I guess that's the best I got terms

62
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
Escape

63
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,120
Thanks

64
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Text Joan

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
The podcast

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Today we are back

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Staying in the present day

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Thanks for that is

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
You know there's been a log

70
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,944
Long periods of time on this podcast where we've just sort of

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
The presents in Sydney

72
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Fat food yes

73
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,880
Suet

74
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Rodger Stone

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
S*** about nothing

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
And I don't really care

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,071
I think there's a lot going on in the present

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
It is much as

79
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Summerville

80
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Awful some of its

81
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,031
Dumb I think it's probably in our best interest in the show's best interest

82
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
To keep an eye on it

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
And see what Alex's take is on

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
Uncertain

85
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
January 6th

86
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Damn

87
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
This is 20/20

88
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,671
Outside of a commercial

89
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
No I don't know if it's

90
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
About Jones

91
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Just cool

92
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Absurd this is

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Interesting

94
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,359
Episode Alex

95
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Alex had some interesting

96
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,551
Positions on the assassination of qassamsoleimani

97
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,671
Wants to not appear to love it but

98
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Appreciate

99
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Alex

100
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Is not continuing

101
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Read so much

102
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
And I think I have a working Siri

103
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
I think it's because he watched the Golden Globes

104
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
I think that that is going to

105
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
Inform literally all of what ends up happening on this episode

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
I think Alex watch the Golden Globes

107
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Okay so here's a frustrating thing

108
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
That should be

109
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,039
A joke listen to that and I'm like

110
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
That makes perfect

111
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,135
Watch the Golden Globes and now we're going to ignore

112
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
Irene house sometimes I don't do this but

113
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Sometimes I'll watch

114
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,839
Like Dave Rubin like a Rubin report

115
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
Just to be like talkin about

116
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
I enter it knowing this is Jesse Lee Peterson interview

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
I just like this is going to make me kind of upset

118
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
I think Alex might do that with like the Golden Globes

119
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,087
I think like a wart

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Suspect that he did that and then now we get

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Oh no I don't want

122
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
We won't

123
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
F*** that guy

124
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
Alex thinks he did a great job

125
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
I can either

126
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:34,751
Confirm or deny that cuz the best job ever I'll never know

127
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
I just don't want people to

128
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Might have had a great set

129
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
Not going to watch

130
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
That's going to look back

131
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:49,599

Bright

160
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Rain finally code

161
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
You're out there listening music

162
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
Or these guys can do that website knowledge

163
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
So Jordan the show open

164
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
With

165
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Alex announcing that the world

166
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Metaphorically

167
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Metaphysically

168
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Spiritually

169
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
And literally

170
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Is on fire we are already is 6 days in

171
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
The world

172
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
He's on fire

173
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,223
Call Shirley MacLaine

174
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
And yes physically

175
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Job now text come in

176
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
From listeners and viewers in the great continent and the great nation

177
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Don't under

178
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Show Infowars live in Australia you're not in Australia

179
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
No you're not

180
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,039
This is one of the reasons why I think Alex is really responding aggressively to the Golden Globes

181
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,183
Because the situation with the fires in Australia for a while it up at all

182
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,791
Now at the Golden Globes the number of people gave speeches that by Cate Blanchett

183
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
Phoenix had some comment

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Supporting

185
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
The effort

186
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
To fight the fires in Australia

187
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
I think this is a backlash

188
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
Hollywood talking about this

189
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
People to set a new fire in Australia how can he be worse about

190
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Well

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
His position Chantix started all of the fight

192
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
His initial take on this is that

193
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
It's no big deal

194
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
This is what this happen

195
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
I think the

196
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
He's being a little bit glib

197
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
I think it's important is the Alex is a

198
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Position on this

199
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
At the end of the show that he doesn't.

200
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Beginnings address

201
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
It is positioned at the beginning is

202
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
They're just fires in Australia it happen

203
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
No big deal this is

204
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
This how

205
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Farmers they burn their fields in order to

206
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Potash

207
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Rights

208
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
This is

209
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
This is sort of the beginning of it and of course it's all just like

210
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
That's what's going on this is a normal situation but the media want

211
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Tell you that it

212
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Climate change

213
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
So they can get carbon taxes

214
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
To pay the roster

215
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
We're going to start here with that this is Alex's take

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
At the beginning

217
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Which is dismissive

218
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
It's very much dismissed

219
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
What's happening in Australia obviously of the millions of Acres burned obviously many deaths

220
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
Obviously a lot of Prague

221
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
Pretty lost but the big story is

222
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,679
The concerted corporate media worldwide is saying its global warming or climate change

223
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
We paid carbon taxes

224
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,847
The UN and the IMF and World Bank and literally the Lord Rothschild

225
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,223
And Al Gore and Obama and Bill Clinton who owned climate exchanges

226
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
In London England in Chicago Illinois

227
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
But they will save us

228
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,487
I'll just buy Australia is China with no environmental control Lobby

229
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
Carbon dioxide come out of coal plants has nothing

230
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Nothing

231
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
To do with the fact

232
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Did Australia has always had Giant

233
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,615
I can sense your anger bubbling up

234
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:05,503
There's no big deal here it says no problems before before we get into any of this

235
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
I think that

236
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Having any kind of tape

237
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
This video is the leading

238
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Part of the yurt your perspective

239
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Had a lying about climate change

240
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
I think it is

241
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Really bad

242
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
Primarily because your focus should be on the people that are affected

243
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Yeah

244
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,471
Your primary focus should be on the people who are suffering

245
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
These people who lost their homes

246
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
That is the immediate crisis

247
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,967
I know that there's a lot of people who listen to our show who live in Australia and

248
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Obviously

249
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Our hearts go out to you and you know I hope

250
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Spiritpact

251
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
Littlest

252
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
I hope I hope you're okay

253
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Okay yeah yeah but

254
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
I just think that he's on the focus

255
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,703
From the people affected and turning it into a larger conspiracy or

256
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
Dismissing it out of hand is a great disservice

257
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
That you can't

258
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
You can't open with

259
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Okay sure

260
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,991
Are there alot of Acres that are burned

261
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Property is damaged

262
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,831
Yada yada yada this is about Obama and

263
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
And taxes right

264
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
F*** you

265
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,999
F*** you but Alex's

266
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Alex is not totally

267
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Incorrect In His statement the fires of always been a part of Australia

268
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,519
The continent has a long history of bushfires which has gotten out of control causing severe damage

269
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,407
Black Saturday in February 2009 is considered the worst fire in recorded Australian history

270
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
Killing 175 people and destroying more than

271
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
2000 lb

272
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
At this point.

273
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,671
The current fires in Australia have killed 27 people but some estimates of it already destroying property

274
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Then the worst

275
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Bushfire on the books

276
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,119
Already millions of acres of land has burned in the impact on things like the environment and animal population

277
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
That isn't something we could even really quantify it

278
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
This point

279
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
Put simply eat even though Australia has a history of fires that is absolutely

280
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
No excuse not to take what's unfolding right now definitely serious

281
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
First things

282
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
No one is saying the climate change is causing

283
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
And the fires

284
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
That is a strong

285
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,367
The argument at the experts are putting forth is that the effect

286
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Some climate change are

287
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Intensifying

288
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
These fires

289
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,815
Phys.org spoke with Stanford University Environmental Studies director Crisfield

290
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Explain the connection

291
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Between climate change and these fires

292
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Coincidentally

293
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
He also described the fires as quote

294
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
One of the worst if not the worst climate change

295
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Extreme besides he's ever seen

296
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,175
What's happened is that Australia has seen decreased rainfall in reason

297
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
Sent yours while the summer is brought record-setting high temperature

298
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
These dropped

299
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
Conditions create dryer fuel for fires

300
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Which can be started by ax

301
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Accident or by a lightning strike

302
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
At which point the fires

303
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Are started are far more intense

304
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
And spread much easier than they would have under.

305
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,727
2019 was the hottest and driest year on record for Australia according to their Bureau of meteorology

306
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
These pieces in place for what

307
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
We're seeing now

308
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
There's not a lot of mystery about this at the expert

309
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Community but somehow to Alex

310
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Discussing the impact of climate change has

311
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm making these climate events for severe

312
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Somehow proof-of

313
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
The grandkids

314
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Does nonsense

315
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Alex always make

316
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Text climate change into a

317
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,743
Conspiracy about people like Obama and Al Gore trying to make money off carpenter

318
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
But now that I actually think about it

319
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
I'm not sure I've ever heard him

320
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Actually layout there

321
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
Profit strategy would be

322
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,239
I realize that I've always just heard him say that in like

323
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Don't worry about it

324
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
They are exchanging climate box

325
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Support about

326
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
That's how they make money dance

327
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
Something like I know he says that they own carbon exchanges which isn't

328
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:57,439
True but even if they did I'm not positive how that would make them Rich if there were carbon taxes implement

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,767
Because in that framework the money collected would go to the

330
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
The government

331
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
I think that Alex is mixing up two different

332
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Potential plans

333
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Been floated about reducing carbon

334
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Carbon taxes

335
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
And cap-and-trade

336
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Carbon taxes would just

337
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Taxes the polluting businesses whatever

338
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
To pay to the government based on their level of carbon

339
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Working theory is that for this

340
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Is that there's a bird

341
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
That's a larger population

342
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Takes on this caused by the pollution

343
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,879
So the taxes would be the polluters way of paying to help mitigate the damage

344
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
What's Don to ever

345
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
They're people with different views

346
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
On how that tax money would be spent

347
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Some people think it's

348
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
Should go to subsidize alternate alternative

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Resources

350
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
Something could be paid to

351
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
To the citizens in the form of carbon dividend

352
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
Others advocated being used for more General

353
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
Construction improvements to make Society more able to

354
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Deal with the consequences

355
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
But the basic idea is that pollution hurts all

356
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
So the polluter should have to pay to help a larger

357
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Society deal with those concert

358
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,647
The independent recently reported on a new study conducted by

359
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
A coalition of 15 health and environmental organization

360
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
And this

361
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Report found that your risk of lung

362
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Cancer Rises approximately 10%

363
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
If you live within 50

364
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Demeter's of a major road

365
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
And that there were additional risks

366
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Childhood lung development from

367
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
The air pollution of living near high levels of track

368
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,407
This is why emissions restricting regulations are important for the automobile

369
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Which incidentally something

370
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
Trump has been signaling that he wants to relax

371
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Considerably

372
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
These are the sorts of things where there is a damage to society

373
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Therefore we need to

374
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
To do these things in order to help

375
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Mitigate that

376
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Damage

377
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
How about this

378
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
All those people can die

379
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Still get all the profits

380
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,679
Behind the carbon

381
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Texas ID

382
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
Conversely cap-and-trade involves the government's setting

383
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
The cap on

384
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Which each company could

385
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Theoretically

386
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,199
But let's say you're running a factory to make improvements that'll sure that you don't end up hitting that

387
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
In that situation you could sell those permitted emissions to another Factory

388
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
It's going to end up

389
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Feeding the cat

390
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
This is the word

391
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Overalls

392
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Feeling for a mission

393
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
And make it so that limit is not exceeded

394
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
Currently 9 states in the United States and many countries around the world have cap-and-trade

395
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Systems in place

396
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Granted there are other cap-and-trade models that don't have an overall feeling that ceiling is sort of variable

397
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
But

398
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
The premise is largely

399
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Do you have a ceiling Atlanta

400
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,967
Of those available allowances people could trade them

401
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
Right and if you want any idea of which one would be better for the environment

402
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,975
Currently most of these companies are lobbying more for a cap-and-trade

403
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,583
Well I think they're putting their money behind cabin

404
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Betrayed over carbon tax

405
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Texting I think

406
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
We we all know

407
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
I think a lot of the people there

408
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
Don't get me wrong. I think a lot of the people who make the most sense that I've heard

409
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
From

410
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Seem to indicate a mixture about this

411
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Probably

412
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Best

413
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
These are two

414
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Plants

415
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
In the tax model the amount of carbon emissions would

416
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Would fluctuate Where is the

417
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
The price of emissions would be static

418
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Conversely in the cabin

419
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Country Market

420
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Determine the price businesses would pay

421
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,607
To buy or sell carbon allowances where is the amount of emissions

422
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Would be static

423
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:23,263
These are intrinsically different but not mutually exclusive and like I said a lot of experts Advocate using both

424
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Comes in some form

425
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Kitchen sink at it

426
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Cap-and-trade

427
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
Is the system wherein Alex's Furious carbon exchanges would be more relevant

428
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Since I presume

429
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
When he's talking about Obama and Al khor owning the

430
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
These carbon equivalent to stock markets

431
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
That's where they would make a cut-off

432
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Off the trading of carbon

433
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Ben credits

434
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
But Alex never talks about cap-and-trade

435
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
He always talks about carbon

436
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Taxes

437
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Which I find weird

438
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
Under the plan involving just carve Texas

439
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
That wouldn't necessarily involve

440
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
Exchanges where people are trading emissions as a commodity

441
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,567
Whenever Alex talks about Al Gore and all of these people owning climatic

442
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,639
You always talked about the Chicago climate Exchange

443
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Like you did in my last class

444
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
This is probably because algor it invested in that Exchange

445
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Through his generation investment fund

446
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
My son

447
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
However

448
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
What else fails to mention ever

449
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Is it the Chicago climate exchange stop trading in carbon

450
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
Credits in November 2010

451
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,119
It's almost been a decade since the Chicago Exchange that anything to do with anything

452
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Closed without the socket

453
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
He has an old piece of information

454
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
Namely that Al Gore had invested in an exchange that was engaging

455
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Carbon

456
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Credit Trading

457
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
He has no idea that he's just

458
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Regurgitating

459
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Conspiracies that are long

460
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
After expiration date

461
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Honestly this kind of thing is embarrassing

462
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
It's just muscle memory for him

463
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
He doesn't know anything you just as phrases you can whip out like Al Gore owns the climate

464
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Chicago Exchange

465
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
10 years

466
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Have you considered

467
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
That they might be laundering

468
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
Okay so what they do

469
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Is and they're still secretly doing

470
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
They just named it something

471
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
It's I'm running out I got nothing that's f****** stupid

472
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Right

473
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
There is a climate exchange that's based in London

474
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
It's called the European climate exchange and it was bought by a large commodity trading business called intercontinentalexchange also

475
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
In 2010

476
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,928
I know that none of the people that Alex listed own Intercontinental Exchange

477
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
But if any of them invested in it

478
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Cares

479
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
It doesn't prove anything

480
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Jay-Z actually on that one

481
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
I don't

482
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
I don't think so

483
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Is it like this retired

484
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Conspiracy

485
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Is it tired conspiracy with no legs

486
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,456
Alex talks I'm not convinced that he knows the difference between carbon tax plan to cap and trade

487
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,088
I'm further not convinced that he's aware that the Chicago climate exchange stop trading carbon credits of almost 10 years

488
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
I strongly suspect that he has no idea what he's talking to

489
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
But he has a lot of climate denial catchphrases that he can repeat

490
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
But they ultimately mean nothing

491
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Larger picture like I said

492
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Alex's first

493
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
Response of the fires in Australia is

494
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Concern for the people affected

495
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Not a call for help

496
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Not feelings

497
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Condolence

498
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
It's the launch into how the media is saying

499
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
The test

500
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Is climate change related

501
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Which is just a plan to get Al Gore

502
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
He's a bad person

503
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Yeah I mean this is bad

504
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
He's basically saying that they're false

505
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Fires in or

506
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
Are there

507
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,464
What is just lying about it

508
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
Climate change when in reality it's normal

509
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
His angle on it is that it's

510
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
It's just a normal

511
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
This is just what happens with controlled Burns

512
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
The farmers do just like in California you know sometimes in order to grow redwoods everything's got a burn

513
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Lauren stuff

514
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Like that and that's why it

515
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
It's totally fine that we've had so much of California on fire for the path

516
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
So Alex is trying to make this argument that it's normal and in service of that he breeds a Wall Street Journal article that I

517
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
I don't think you ready

518
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Before the show

519
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Because

520
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Kind of tense

521
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
To contradict that this is normal

522
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
Kind of angle

523
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
Hiding in plain view

524
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Australia's catastrophic

525
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,752
Threatened up in the way people live Wall Street Journal

526
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Igniting too much earlier

527
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Usual start

528
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
I'll be Australian

529
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
Fire season the Flames of torrent

530
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
An area about the size of West Virginia

531
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
So it's not

532
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
At least 20 people

533
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648
Crowded cities in Chelsea Hayes in

534
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Stretching firefighters the breaking point

535
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
So that's bad

536
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Minerals things

537
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
Into the soil to grow again

538
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,384
So then you can see the likes order the theme of his main argument at the beginning of the show just normal

539
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
People doing controlled Burns to make sure plentiful Harvest shots

540
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,856
Unfortunately decided to read that Wall Street Journal article without pre-screening any accidentally contradicted

541
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,184
Entire narrative by pointing out that the fire is two months early this year

542
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
Generally if

543
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
The fires of the result of

544
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Control control

545
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
The new respect

546
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
Gigantic Fighters 2 months earlier that's why we have early because that's just

547
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
Early normal it's just normal but a little bit sooner

548
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,456
So if you're paying attention to Alex and know their words mean things

549
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,856
Explain why farmers are doing these controlled Burns 2 months earlier than they have ever erupt

550
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
He knows he can't do that to me just move forward

551
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,000
Pretending that he didn't just read that line that is kid a real problem

552
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,608
The important Point here is that Alex has absolutely no idea what he's talking about

553
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
He just feels like this is a result of farmers burning their fields

554
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,264
Improve the soil for the next season

555
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
It's just his opinion

556
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
Which is not shared by any Source I can find

557
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
It discusses the fire

558
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Add to that the fact that he seems

559
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Completely unaware that

560
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
These fires are out

561
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Season 4 normal fire pattern

562
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
You've every reason to think that this is just a dude talking

563
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
Just talkingshit he's reacting

564
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
He's reacting in that pre-programmed wave

565
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
It's so many climate denial is

566
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Exist now because

567
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,376
At this point we are in it while I'm Jordan This is 20/20

568
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
And we are in a situation

569
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
You can't avoid it is

570
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
All of the denialism that you did

571
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
You made this worse

572
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
So now you can't do anything but look

573
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Burning fire

574
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
That is

575
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
F****** world without admitting it and you don't want to do that cuz then

576
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
You have to admit that you played a part in

577
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Well the basketball

578
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,488
The reason is falling apart so you keep tonight the best strategy is just kind of need your denial and hand-waving

579
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
It seems like that is what Alex

580
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Intended to do

581
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
When he started the episode

582
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
And I keep implying that it's going to change

583
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Because it is

584
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
But he's probably read The Wall Street Journal

585
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
Do this this will back me up no big deal

586
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
Why you do that I have no idea

587
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,712
You got to read these articles before you talk about amalec you start reading the Bonaire

588
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
. that would be nice

589
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
So the thing is the climate change is the

590
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
The greatest weapon against Society

591
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Right

592
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,768
If if these choirs greatest threat to society but I suppose that could be weaponized please climb

593
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Change people get their way they will be able to destroy us

594
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
Quite frankly is Hitler

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Had Environmental

596
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Regulation

597
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
Could never get bombers over the United States bomber

598
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,088
But if he could have lobbied environmentalist before to tell us we were all guilty and bad. Did not have any

599
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
Well he could have dominated it's just like China

600
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,768
Many more times coal power plants that we have they build new ones every week

601
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
We shut down under Obama

602
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
We have thousands of years of Clean Coal

603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Wow facts is carbon

604
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Outside

605
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Water

606
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,336
So for a long time I've heard Alex say that all called in the United States

607
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
Clean Coal which obviously isn't true but I've just kind of assumed he was just lying

608
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Now I'm becoming convinced

609
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Steve just doesn't know what he's talking

610
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
At the end of that clip he says that we have all this Clean Coal and all that comes out of

611
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
Power plants is CO2 and water

612
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
But that isn't what Clean Coal is

613
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,816
Clean Coal Technologies usually refer to Technologies

614
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Is that don't allow CO2 emission

615
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,936
For instance there's carbon capture technology

616
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Capture all the

617
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Sims 4 burning

618
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:28,896
Send text to least be stored somewhere

619
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Plus retrofitting existing

620
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Coal power plants to make this technology is

621
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Insanely

622
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Expensive

623
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,648
And if I was his primary concern is the carbon taxes would make operating power plants too expensive

624
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
This is not

625
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Play Andy should be enthusiastic

626
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Pre-market dad

627
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,096
Have the government in there I don't think he understands this stuff at all

628
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Cuz the way he's

629
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
It's freezing this all the comes out as CO2 and water it's

630
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Well that's the problem

631
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
You have accidentally gotten this

632
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
Exactly right

633
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
Singer that is what clean

634
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Doesn't understand

635
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
He doesn't understand

636
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
The premises

637
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
He doesn't understand the

638
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
He's discussing

639
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
I mean to be fair there are some promise

640
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,952
Sing ideas by carbon capture but honestly based on

641
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
I don't think he has an idea of what those the

642
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Things Are

643
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,912
He's just saying we have this clean call stuff going on and I'll plan submit or CO2 and water

644
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
That's

645
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
The point

646
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
I'm saying

647
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Honestly

648
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
He's talking

649
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Especially on this more so than normal

650
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
I don't think he knows

651
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
What he's talkin to

652
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,760
No I don't think the words that he's saying makes sense

653
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,160
Here's where he gets into trouble

654
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Is that

655
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
He accidentally reveals

656
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
What everybody knows which

657
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Is that clean call Ezra

658
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
It's just not

659
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,216
Turn number things in some of them shows of the cross

660
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Alex

661
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
To be like a concept that like you take a little toothbrush

662
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Yeah well that's the way that it

663
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
Used as a propaganda tool

664
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
Do you think Cole is bad

665
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,416
And thank God we're not using that anymore using clean call witch

666
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
The same thing took a bath

667
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Exact

668
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
That's what they're trying to

669
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Convince people

670
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,888
Actually I can make things

671
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Involved

672
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
I know I know it's not take

673
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:34,080
In terms of like cleaning some cold rag and make things

674
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
A little better but not nearly enough

675
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,504
And somehow the worst way to solve this problem is actually to burn the coal plant

676
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
You would think that that would work but

677
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Cruel irony

678
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
I just don't think

679
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Galaxy

680
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
Severely out of his depth

681
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
And the talking

682
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Points that he's using

683
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
And the way you present

684
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
Big things mismatches even itself so much

685
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Did I just

686
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
I hear this

687
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Sad

688
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
But actually I

689
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
We have a moment here where

690
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
We got to give credit where credit's due

691
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:13,248
Alex jumps to talkin about the evolving situation with Trump and Iran and Iraq

692
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
That sort of

693
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Triangular

694
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Situation

695
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
And I actually think that Alex has

696
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
A pretty good thought

697
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
I hate to say it

698
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Do we have

699
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Streamers do we have to celebrate

700
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
Never I will never celebrate Alex having a decent

701
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Position

702
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Because

703
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
I know that

704
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,992
You'll probably be invalidated tomorrow it's and it's so Elementary I'm not going to applaud him for

705
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Eating a sentence basically is going to play

706
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
But credit where credit

707
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,184
The fact that Trump has come out and said that he's threatening sanctions

708
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,048
We will not leave until they pay billions of dollars

709
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,888
The United States invaded Iraq United States overthrew

710
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Earlier

711
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
I understand from saying we should have had to pay for all that

712
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Royal

713
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,712
When I see something

714
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Security for supporting Trump

715
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,624
Because he's a nationalist

716
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Croagunk

717
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
He's he's he eat he's calling the shots. They loved ones

718
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Poker Face

719
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
So f*** the end of that but

720
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
At the beginning I think he's

721
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
He's on the right track

722
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
He's on the right side of the idea that Trump wanted

723
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Extort a rock

724
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
Before removing troops

725
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,480
That is bad reason I don't want to give too much promises because I feel like there's a pretty obvious

726
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
But I do think

727
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,088
As we are such a Negative show about Alex

728
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
I think it's

729
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Pretty important

730
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
The point out these very rare occasions

731
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
When he has a decent thought

732
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Because I do think

733
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,352
Like treating him as a guy who's always wrong about everything

734
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Welfare League

735
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
Isn't really fair and it would turn him into a monster

736
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
As opposed to a human who's

737
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Monstrous

738
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
I don't have much

739
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Interest in

740
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
Like doing the podcast about a caricature of somebody urur rights

741
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
That

742
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
It is a very

743
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
Simple an elemental thoughts that we shouldn't be running an international

744
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
Protection brick

745
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
It does seem like that the

746
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Simple

747
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
We should

748
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Just be going around country to Country

749
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,936
Hey be terrible if your gum

750
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
It seems

751
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:50,944
Almost I mean if you're laughing you're laughing

752
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
So what's happened here is that in the aftermath of the assassination of qassamsoleimani Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding

753
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Resolution to expel archery

754
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
From the country

755
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
They're seeking to cancel the rocks

756
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Request for us

757
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Isis

758
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Validator reason

759
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
To continue to be there in the country

760
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
This is one of those

761
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
Consequences do the sulemani assassination

762
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Seems like

763
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,776
America will face consequences

764
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
It seemed like

765
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
No one really had a plan for this

766
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
No one has any f****** clue what's going on it's kind of amazing so the parliament is just requesting that the government of Iraq do

767
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,856
Which would make one think that it's not going to go anywhere except

768
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,720
For the fact that the resolution was passed after prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi

769
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
Ask Parliament to act

770
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
Stupid spell foreign

771
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
In response to Trump

772
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
Threatened to quote charge them sanctions like they've never seen before ever make a Ronnie NSYNC

773
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Looks somewhat

774
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
He also said quote we have very

775
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
Extraordinary expenses Air Base

776
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:57,248
Despair that's their it cost billions of dollars to build we're not leaving unless they pay us back for it

777
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,856
Trump is being a huge a****** and acting in ways that are very unhelpful so it

778
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
It's good to see that Alex can see that

779
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
The thing is though

780
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
Really different than how Trump always act

781
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
So it's unclear why this time Alex is hedging

782
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,424
I would bet it has something to do with realizing that supporting this kind of shape

783
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,496
Probably alienate whatever base Alex has left

784
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
Those calls he took on Friday when

785
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Not a good

786
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Sampling of his audience

787
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
The temperature

788
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
And he recognized

789
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
If you realize it's like okay this is going

790
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Possibly

791
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
Stan

792
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Tend towards

793
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Trouble

794
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,368
And if I support that

795
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
I will lose any of the

796
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Ron Paul

797
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
Auntie interventionist

798
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
Type

799
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
That

800
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
They were the people who

801
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Theoretically have been around the longest

802
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
Yeah that there's a line that Alex

803
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Across

804
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
And that's probably starting a war it's really frustrating

805
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
Sing to me that that line is the difference

806
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,176
I'm fine with it him terrorizing

807
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Black and brown people

808
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Well here but not in other

809
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
You have to really

810
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Bucked up

811
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Little Lion they live on

812
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
Well yeah I mean you know just goes

813
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
The show like

814
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
People are different

815
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
People have a different truck

816
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,632
That is not a priority for him it's not

817
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
It's a it's a tough realization

818
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
I don't know I don't I don't

819
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
I guess

820
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
I guess they do love war

821
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
They just don't like

822
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
The fact that there is an

823
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
That isn't

824
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
It's like

825
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
We unequivocally one

826
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Like they never like the people who wants

827
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
Who want these kinds of wars or even who don't

828
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Who have this anti-interventionist

829
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
It's not because of the war

830
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,376
It's because it's going to cost money and last 20 years like what we're dealing with now

831
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,448
Yeah perhaps what they would prefer is just like we win

832
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
So now Iraq is

833
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
51st state

834
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
You know like it's over

835
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:00,896
Sure like never have to worry about franchising America

836
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Alright

837
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Bad idea

838
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
So Alex

839
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
It's back to the climate issues

840
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,368
And Australia nonsense here in a little bit

841
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
But he's mostly complaining about

842
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
China

843
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
In this clip

844
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Complaining

845
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Because

846
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,632
Like I said I really think that a lot of this has to do with watching the Golden Globes

847
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,936
Because his way in for a lot of this stuff

848
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,568
He's complaining about Cate Blanchett share hand and others and their speeches

849
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,896
He's complaining about how Blanchette said

850
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,504
It went with one country faces a climate crisis we all are

851
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Sing that

852
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,136
And his rebuttal to that is what about her China puts a lot of trash into the ocean

853
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,720
That is a very grown-up an adult way of dealing with that

854
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,536
Criticism and I have a little thought on the other side

855
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,656
Another one of these

856
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Real quick

857
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
I don't think we ripped

858
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
Consult a professional actress

859
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
Being a script reader

860
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
You idiot

861
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
China is responsible for over half the trash in the world

862
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
The ocean

863
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Buy those big

864
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Super chefs

865
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
Chips

866
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,568
12 Mile Line and dump it

867
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
That does affect the whole world

868
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
Never hear a word with these environmental groups about telling

869
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes you do that's all the time that's what we say all the time all the time

870
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
So

871
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
I don't know if his

872
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Pixel right cuz I didn't

873
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,816
Bother to look into them I'm not sure if they are I know that pollution is a problem n

874
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
And all that

875
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
About that quite regularly

876
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
And also largely

877
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
The problem with Alex

878
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
This point here is that his worldview doesn't have a solution

879
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,104
Intuit but globalization does

880
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,200
He's recognizing the interconnectedness of

881
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
Actions that are taken by other countries and how they affect

882
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:19,392
Okay so you're saying you're saying that that's our nation which I love that there is hibernation

883
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,512
By virtue of what they're doing is hurting me personally so how do I tell them

884
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
What to do

885
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
We'll see

886
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Problem is

887
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
I can't do anything

888
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
Inside Alex's framework that's

889
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Completely nationalist about

890
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
China puta

891
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,824
There's nothing you can do other than I guess start a war with them

892
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,408
You can impose sanctions but I don't know if that's going to work

893
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Trade with them

894
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Globalized

895
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,184
Framework that would be International mechanisms in place where the responsibilities that different countries have to each other

896
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Should be handled

897
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
Things that Alex is passionately against

898
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Like the Paris Accord

899
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,656
Even to some extent

900
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
Impossible Within

901
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,896
Like obviously not talking about a one-world government necessarily

902
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
In terms of international

903
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
National bodies

904
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,528
That have enforcement mechanisms in place

905
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,880
You could do that like a China you are polluting in ways that are affecting other

906
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Countries

907
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Whether it would end up being a

908
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Like a financial

909
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Punitive thing

910
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
In order to help

911
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
The country that's affected

912
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,120
Did cleanup from the message out

913
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm kind of

914
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Putative

915
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
Measure that's taken to make them stop

916
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
International bodies can do that

917
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Nationalist

918
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Countries

919
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Independently acting

920
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:50,784
Cannot read the only way that one country would be able to do something like that is if a

921
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
Where the entire world

922
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
What if

923
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,440
We have one let's not do it let's do one nation

924
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Will Jace just the entire world

925
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
All nationalist

926
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
Now see populism iFixit

927
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
The issue 2 is like okay Alex

928
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,568
United States could put pressure on China in order to make them stop

929
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
That's not going to work

930
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
A group

931
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Nations

932
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Sovereign Nation

933
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Could get together to put pressure on

934
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,088
And you see how that already is stepping down the line

935
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,648
Eventually what is the ideal solution

936
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Group

937
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,024
Nation's sovereign individual Nations working together

938
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
It is good

939
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,424
Better is if China was also one of those patterns

940
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,776
You're slowly making more and more sense and I'm not liking

941
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,640
But that's what I should recognize as well obviously

942
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Like it's in his face

943
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
Can't even ignore it. Really

944
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552
Why some of these ideas are very dumb

945
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
It is it used to work

946
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
But now the world is when the world was big

947
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
Nation seems

948
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Like you could

949
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Exist

950
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Solo

951
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Another world is very very small

952
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,096
Is far too much interconnectedness for assault

953
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
To ever really

954
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
And we know a lot

955
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Absolutely

956
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,240
About the ways that let's say

957
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,056
Air pollution in

958
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,920
Most northern parts of America can affect Canada

959
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
It's

960
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
The lines of borders

961
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Don't

962
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Stop

963
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Real thing

964
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,976
Can draw it on a map natural forces or not

965
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
Beholding to

966
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Then that's just a reality

967
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Do we need to deal with

968
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
We want to move forward

969
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Good for nausea

970
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Alex Gordon

971
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
So he's complained

972
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
Is larger about China

973
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
And

974
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
What is things that he brings up here is that like

975
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
So if you have a motor

976
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Cycle

977
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
It is really bad

978
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
And polluting

979
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
But yeah that's

980
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Bad we have catalytic converters

981
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
And now Motors

982
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Cycles have to have those

983
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
That is a good regulation

984
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
The first we learned that there are some good regulation

985
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Which

986
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:14,399
Means that he now has a responsibility to differentiate between what is a good regulation

987
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,007
What's a bad one in what makes a good one and what makes bad want to see

988
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Alright I'm straight up lies about you

989
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,663
Play lecture everyone

990
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,735
Don't fly on airplanes that don't have a car

991
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
I don't have a motorcycle with bad finger

992
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,135
So getting he's complaining about Golden Globe speeches

993
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,743
Having a dirty tailpipe not having a catalytic converters bad for everybody

994
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Regulation

995
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
Brown smoke in the sky

996
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Engineering

997
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
But we don't

998
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
Want to do that

999
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
That'll make us not competitive

1000
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,063
I'm trying to just now getting around to saying catalytic converters

1001
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,855
No controls on the smokestack

1002
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Don't get the river catch on fire

1003
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Really

1004
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,279
So I sincerely think Alex is completely relying on entirely out of date information

1005
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
This narrative

1006
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,423
I say that because what he saying about China is completely inaccurate to the point where

1007
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
Kind of feels like he's just making it up

1008
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,359
I will say that he's not making up and think about a river catching on fire in China but also have added 24

1009
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
Incidentally that same gear a dude in North Dakota caused a bit of a stir by posting a video to YouTube reset the water coming

1010
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Going out of his faucet on fire

1011
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
So I guess it's not just a China

1012
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,207
And it was only 1969 when the Cuyahoga River in

1013
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
Set on fire here in the United States

1014
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,559
And that's not so long ago in the big picture thing

1015
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,423
Oh and also that's a mere 1969b Rouge River in Detroit set on fire

1016
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
119

1017
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
68 the Buffalo River set on fire

1018
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,359
This would still be happening regularly in the United States if it weren't for the Environmental Protection

1019
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Action Agency

1020
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
Which Alex is not a fan of

1021
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Weirdly

1022
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Exact

1023
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
David sandal hours Columbia University Center for Global energy policy released a 169 page guy

1024
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
To the Chinese climate Paula

1025
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Does Reese

1026
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,375
Is reflecting the State of Affairs in 2019 as well as initiatives the Chinese government has undertaken to

1027
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Counterclaim

1028
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Suffice it to say

1029
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
They just got catalytic converters is not

1030
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
The conclusion this paper

1031
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
One thing that's important to remember is that China is a massive country

1032
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Has been

1033
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Experiencing a boom

1034
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
In the past decade

1035
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,551
When you talk about one aspect of their energy policy

1036
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,879
If crucial to consider other aspects as well so you can get a full pic

1037
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Princeton

1038
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,975
China has added a lot of coal-fired power

1039
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Cassidy in the past years

1040
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
But it's

1041
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
The same time they also added quote

1042
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
43% of the world's new Renewable Power capacity

1043
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
In 2018

1044
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,495
China is also a country that is 45% of the elect

1045
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Vehicles in the world

1046
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
And ninety-nine percent of deal

1047
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Bosses in the world

1048
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,199
Another aspect of this that has to be taken into account as China's giganta

1049
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Population

1050
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
In 2018 they were the largest

1051
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
Emitter of

1052
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Heat-trapping gases

1053
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,415
But if you look at the numbers on a per-capita level they were only emitting

1054
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
6.6 metric

1055
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Per person

1056
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
As opposed to

1057
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
18.7 metric tons

1058
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
For America

1059
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
What I'm saying is that there's a complex picture

1060
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Climate issues

1061
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,727
It's not easily captured by single stats are vague Notions

1062
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Like Alex Drive

1063
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
To put Fork

1064
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
It's probably

1065
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Only true the China had previously taken a really dismissive posture towards climate issues but they've been a bit more responsive and recent

1066
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
Leaving Oz

1067
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
The plan to achieve

1068
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Peak CO2 emissions by 2030

1069
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
With goals to hit that

1070
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Exooter

1071
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
A goal that most analysts

1072
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Think is very achievable

1073
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
They've committed to

1074
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Creating

1075
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,047
4.5 billion cubic Acres of reforestation B

1076
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
20/30 and they actually

1077
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Accomplish that goal 11

1078
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
7 years ahead of schedule

1079
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
There are the best

1080
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Programs in place work

1081
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Sing in the right direction

1082
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
In their Five-Year Plan covering

1083
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,359
2016 to 2020 they put in place regulations that work

1084
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Require quotes

1085
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
All new coal plants must

1086
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Use super

1087
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
For critical or ultrasound

1088
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Supercritical technology

1089
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
And the oldest

1090
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
Technologies were to be retired

1091
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
Bye 2017

1092
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,927
90 of their 100 largest coal-burning power plant

1093
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Ultra super critic

1094
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
They launched

1095
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
Carbon trading program

1096
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,559
An eight cities and provinces

1097
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,375
Plans to implement it nationally in the near future

1098
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
That is quite literally China

1099
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
Placing a price on emitting carbon

1100
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,799
Which Alex is claiming they refuse to do because they don't want to be competitive

1101
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
Are they only uncompetitive

1102
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
Additionally they put in place to build

1103
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,223
Standards to make residential and public buildings more energy-efficient

1104
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
And quote as of September 26th

1105
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Steve roughly 4,500 building

1106
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
China

1107
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Did receive Green Building label

1108
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,951
I could go on and on about this stuff but I think the point is pretty

1109
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,047
It's just not fair to say the China is not doing anything about climate issues

1110
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
The primary conclusion of this report is literally quote

1111
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
The Chinese government

1112
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
What is taking significant steps to address climate

1113
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,055
There are negatives in the next to like their uses

1114
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
Synthetic natural gases which is not good

1115
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,431
But the general Trend seems to be in a positive direction

1116
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
China news

1117
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,807
They were countries it's particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change

1118
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,623
From their long history of severe drought

1119
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
To all the more reason

1120
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,951
Phenomenon of horrible air pollution

1121
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
Nothing but Alex is saying at all depict reality

1122
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
But I think it might to pick reality

1123
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
A little bit

1124
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Closer to

1125
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
The truth

1126
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:40,287
The last time he actually cared about doing his job early instead

1127
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Maybe even longer

1128
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,175
I think this is all just remnants of the time when he actually cared to look into things

1129
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
Members this stuff

1130
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
And hasn't ever

1131
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Check the updated

1132
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,087
Same thing with Al Gore in the Chicago climate Exchange

1133
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
He's just never checked into

1134
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Is this

1135
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
Still truth yeah I know I was yelling about it

1136
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,743
In 2007

1137
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
It does

1138
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,583
It just seemed like maybe one of the side effects of

1139
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
Taking too many of his supplements

1140
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,447
Is the inability to turn short-term memories into long-term

1141
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
You know

1142
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
Long-term memories are Paramount

1143
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:21,247
What I mean is he can't replace new long-term memories you know he's just a memory disappear

1144
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
Disagree because I don't think he has a short-term memory is no longer being true

1145
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Doesn't care

1146
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,279
You checked the Box about China doesn't care about climate change

1147
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
He doesn't even care to

1148
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
To check so there is no short-term memory

1149
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
There's no

1150
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
There's no updating at all

1151
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
Mm2 B2B

1152
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Totally said none of this is like

1153
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,895
Chinese government is doing everything right of course

1154
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,503
Absolutely issue

1155
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,319
Let's just say the Chinese government is doing everything

1156
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
I think you're

1157
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
I think you're in trouble

1158
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
You in the climb

1159
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,511
I take is that what I was saying is not true

1160
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,815
There is a complicated in larger picture

1161
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
Sure to Chinese climate policy

1162
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
Alex

1163
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Refuses to engage with

1164
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,263
Because I think it would show that maybe they are

1165
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,335
At least indicating the stronger things than

1166
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Trumpet

1167
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Absolutely

1168
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,295
Anthony's day they tend to invalidate his entire narrative about trying to just wanted to shut down

1169
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
And refused

1170
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
To do these things

1171
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
Domestically and internally

1172
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Because it would make the monkey

1173
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Competitive

1174
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,279
Yeah there is something of a

1175
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,071
Benefit to having a nationalized

1176
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,655
Enacted

1177
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
With

1178
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
I mean not

1179
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
It's not like unilaterally but

1180
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Very aggressive

1181
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,823
Sibley and the parties pressure

1182
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Sure can make it happen

1183
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Quicker than

1184
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:58,527
If there's I need to have a year of debate on this in my Batman.

1185
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,135
Preferably one of the things that that system is capable

1186
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
Will doing that

1187
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
Simply Mount your comment is descriptive less than

1188
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Prescriptive

1189
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:13,887
Yeah cuz I think was really interesting about reading that climate report from the Columbia

1190
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
Energy policy

1191
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Elsie Center was

1192
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,007
They told me that they highlighted a bit is

1193
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
How what are the things

1194
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
The China does the

1195
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
Really affect

1196
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,175
Is that they set variable goals for the various provinces

1197
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Insidious

1198
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
Depending on what is achievable within those

1199
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,087
So they make this forward progress

1200
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,927
Within the dissection sectors of the country

1201
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
That's progress

1202
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,999
Appropriate

1203
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
Apparently

1204
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
It seems

1205
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,863
Like that is a very effective

1206
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
Approach that they've

1207
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,799
I mean it tastes similar to I don't know if you ever had to sell cars but one of the things that

1208
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,847
They do with the bunch of salesman is

1209
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,223
If you're a really good salesman they'll be like your goal for this month is sell 12 cars

1210
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,039
Have your bad when they're like your goal is to sell for cars

1211
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Just because

1212
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
That what you're setting

1213
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,183
Achievable goals for yourself which makes you more motivated to do so

1214
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
One of the principles of productivity

1215
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,815
And if everybody's trying to get 12 I don't know there's some sort of Bible verse

1216
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
You have to

1217
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
Actionable items that are itchy

1218
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
Feasible

1219
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Probably going to

1220
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,519
To dismiss them as like All That Pie in the Sky

1221
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Exactly

1222
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,103
So I just think that

1223
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
You know Alex's

1224
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
In the same way that I think it's important

1225
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
To give props

1226
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
The Alex when he says something like Trump

1227
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
Is trying to extort a rock

1228
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
This is really bad

1229
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
I think that's important

1230
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
Because it deals with Alex

1231
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
He is as opposed to

1232
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,279
Do a cartoonish sketch China just got catalytic

1233
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Converters

1234
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,863
That's him treating his enemy as a Cartoonist

1235
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
And you see how ineffective and stupid

1236
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
But that is

1237
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
He's very dumb

1238
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
You just hates China

1239
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
He's turns them into

1240
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
A new Big Bang

1241
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,175
So Alucard

1242
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,319
As we started the show Alex was saying that he's live in Australia

1243
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Take calls

1244
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
From Australia

1245
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
Does he know there's a

1246
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
The time difference

1247
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
He does only brings up repeated

1248
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
Used to be doing the night shift

1249
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,607
Do annihilate later radio heat always be called

1250
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
Australia

1251
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,215
Sure sure he would I leave that aside

1252
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
I don't care

1253
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Nick kyrgios has got some

1254
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Tasty Asia

1255
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
It's not coming

1256
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Don't doesn't

1257
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Okay so

1258
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
He's at he decides he's going to take some calls

1259
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Two calls from Australia

1260
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
And they're both

1261
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Great

1262
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,951
Yes okay

1263
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
So here he is

1264
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,535
Here's where the narrative starts

1265
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
Your phone calls right now from Australia

1266
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Calling in

1267
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,679
But these record fires Witcher

1268
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,959
Been man-made

1269
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,799
Happening in

1270
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
Where what

1271
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
Crazy people

1272
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Shmoney

1273
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,135
So now Alex's angle on this is at the fires in Australia arson

1274
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
I can't stress this enough

1275
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
Up to this point in the show you saying it's a completely natural thing we're farmers do controlled burn

1276
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,399
This indicates to me that I was talking about when he started

1277
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
The show so he's planning to just hand

1278
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,799
Big deal but when he saw a headline that indicated baby there was some arson

1279
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
He decided

1280
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
I can walk with your way

1281
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,663
That's my way there are some people who have been arrested

1282
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,759
For setting fires driver what's going on in Australia

1283
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
A large part of the push

1284
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,391
For the narratives itself is all around an online conspiracy theory that

1285
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
Climate extremist reciting

1286
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
The fire is a false flag climate change is real

1287
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
Which I expect will be Alex

1288
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,863
This position eventually work

1289
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
Stoneware still around will you be on that right now

1290
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Baby

1291
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
Maybe I don't think so no care

1292
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
He's got other issues

1293
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,359
Even if he wasn't going to prison. Other issues

1294
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
IAAI think that Alex has seen some sort of the headline and now he decides to make a break in his coverage and go

1295
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
This way

1296
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
And so now it's

1297
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Conspiracy

1298
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
Hey starts rambling

1299
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
About stuff

1300
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
That just makes no sense

1301
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,023
California

1302
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Say Ruel

1303
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,727
Takeout mountain lions eat people

1304
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,335
This is the rewilding projects so how bad is it going to get in

1305
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
Do you know anything about mad lions eating people

1306
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
No

1307
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,223
It's a serious problem

1308
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,783
No

1309
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,647
16 years since anyone has been killed by a mountain lion in California

1310
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
In fact

1311
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,255
Only two people have been killed by mountain lions in the United States in the last 12 years

1312
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,839
A 55 year old woman and a national forest in Oregon

1313
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
Andy thirty-two-year-old woman in

1314
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
The foothills of North Bend wash

1315
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
So what you're saying

1316
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,775
Is that mountain lions are hunting women in the Pacific

1317
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Ignore

1318
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,431
I guess I'll just

1319
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:19,295
Good because you can't kill mountain lions now they're eating people all over the place

1320
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
Alex is weird obsession with the idea that animals are eating people in California

1321
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:30,047
He's brought it up about like what was the other animal

1322
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:34,911
I guess he just knows the California is a completely foreign land to all his listeners

1323
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,983
So it doesn't matter how real anything he says about the state is

1324
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,311
Lookout don't go to California get eaten by a mountain lion

1325
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
I did not realize that predatory cat

1326
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
Very serious very serious brows

1327
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,831
I just should I be worried forget about a certain Chicago should I be worried

1328
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
Forget about a rock

1329
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,927
Text

1330
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:01,791
Another movie movie was predicted program

1331
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:08,959
Herbalife talking to you so. One day mountain lion guard hey how's it going Rum Tum Tugger

1332
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Text

1333
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
You're eating

1334
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
Battle happen

1335
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,871
I'm pretty sure Judi Dench killed at least four people and making them

1336
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
Undoubtedly

1337
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,967
There a lot of reasons my fire breaks or not

1338
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
Particularly, California

1339
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
But it's not so much

1340
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,087
But the state won't let you do that

1341
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Because they wouldn't

1342
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,695
California's geography is pretty mountainous so finding

1343
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
The right place

1344
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
To make the brakes of

1345
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Be pretty difficult

1346
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:37,631
But more importantly one of the primary characteristics of California fires is that they are wind-driven

1347
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
The wind spreads

1348
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
The fire to such a great extent the firebreaks

1349
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
Really have the desired effect

1350
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Stopping the fires progression

1351
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
The firewood

1352
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Just jump over

1353
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,175
The campfire is actually a prime example of this

1354
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,991
Have brakes in place but it didn't matter

1355
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
The fire cross the brakes

1356
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Super easy

1357
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,879
Paradise California did exactly what Alex's suggested

1358
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,719
They spent millions of dollars to remove underbrush and make fire breaks

1359
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
100ft wide

1360
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:08,351
A from the firework easily carried across that Gap and the town was basically to

1361
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Destroyed

1362
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,911
Every one of the 10 most

1363
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
Destructive California fires

1364
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
I've been driven by the wind

1365
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
Which is not something that Alex's solution helps with

1366
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
For that all

1367
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
So once again we find out stalking

1368
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Complete

1369
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,431
Having no idea of the topic that he pretends to be annexed

1370
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,991
But will make fire breaks

1371
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
They go up in

1372
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
Into the sky

1373
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,599
Very tall

1374
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
What is great again start

1375
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,815
There is no State ruled Advance fire breaks in fact Cal Fire director Tom Porter till the LA times recently

1376
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,095
We continue to do that

1377
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,143
They helped us get people out of the way

1378
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,727
They serve some purpose to slow down a fire but it

1379
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
It's not really a full preventive strategy

1380
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
When wind is a factor

1381
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,895
I was just making s*** up about firebreaks a mountain lion

1382
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
It's at the point where I don't even know why he does

1383
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Yeah like I don't know what the

1384
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
The point is

1385
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,319
He's not helping old made of

1386
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
Nobody even like his

1387
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Denying climate change is like

1388
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
Yeah I really needed that mountain lion B there

1389
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,327
You could have just ignored I think he just thinks it makes it more interesting

1390
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,911
Yeah I get the sense that he just

1391
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:24,383
A little a little inflammatory like 10 days a week

1392
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:30,527
Mountain lions over there and everybody's and I think a large piece of it too is

1393
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
The other ring of caliph

1394
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,439
It seemed like some kind of a cake do you got the

1395
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:43,839
Governor out there that Democratic globalist I know he doesn't care about people he wants these fires that happened

1396
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
They're putting

1397
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
Things in place to make mountain lions eat

1398
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
You know it's just that sort of

1399
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
Nonsensical

1400
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Over like

1401
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:56,639
Cartoonish version of time

1402
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Is the only time to vases

1403
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
Is going to come up at 8

1404
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,343
Alex's take on this is really funny

1405
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Happened

1406
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
The Golden Globes

1407
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Wisdom in Canadian

1408
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
Debatable coming out

1409
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
Housing Hollywood has a bunch of

1410
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Pedophiles

1411
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,055
That would have been really big news I feel like that would have been really big new Maiden

1412
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
Seeing Joker

1413
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,247
Ricky Gervais

1414
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
I love it

1415
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,903
I love it oh man

1416
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Cowboy

1417
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,719
I fell it takes Epstein

1418
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,559
Good2Go in my good books

1419
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
What a phenomenal job amazing happened at the

1420
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
The Golden Globes

1421
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
Tonight

1422
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,775
Focally annoying atheists in the world made of

1423
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
Epic joke about episode

1424
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,223
I dunno what amazing previously like the figureheads in the big figures in the air

1425
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
GPS community

1426
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
Vampire

1427
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,743
Hey brother man Alex make some f****** sense for 1 seconds

1428
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,583
Just some some consistent

1429
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,655
Some continuity from idea to an idea

1430
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
I need something

1431
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
It's not important

1432
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
So Alex

1433
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,263
It goes to this verse

1434
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,311
Caller from Australia

1435
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,503
I just turned 41 in the I'm living in

1436
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,391
But I've never seen anything like

1437
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
Before and

1438
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
Deliberately

1439
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Something

1440
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,423
You know I randomly paper roll here.

1441
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
Nothing like these

1442
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,775
I have been writing articles.

1443
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
Eastern Shelf

1444
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,895
Coming from Brisbane down to Melbourne

1445
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,711
They are actually planning on a high-speed rail

1446
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:13,087
My alarm down there and agenda 2030

1447
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Agenda 21

1448
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
A long day

1449
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
So I have read a couple of theories at

1450
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
California

1451
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
So this is a popular conspiracy theories

1452
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:30,495
It's flying around. That's the updating of Agenda 21

1453
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,383
Right there's nothing to back this up other than that Australia has talked about building High-Speed Rail line

1454
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Let's just released

1455
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:43,807
Alex get the caller from Australia and the main things he brings to the table is that she read something on a dumb blog

1456
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,855
This is not good

1457
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Is bringing the heat today

1458
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
Isn't good

1459
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
So Alex talked to her a little bit

1460
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,303
It's mostly more of this

1461
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
And I still

1462
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
Really bad

1463
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,423
About how this call I don't want them

1464
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
This person too much

1465
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,007
Cuz she gets pretty emotional

1466
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
But I think if you take the

1467
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
Content of what

1468
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
She saying

1469
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,663
This is not somebody that you should take as a good source of in

1470
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:14,527
O'Reilly's in Berkeley

1471
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Coup d'etat

1472
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
Australia's New World City

1473
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
Australia

1474
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,423
Doesn't mean

1475
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
It doesn't

1476
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:37,567
You know what I mean

1477
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,735
Batman

1478
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
This is true

1479
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
1564

1480
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Doing that

1481
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
Melbourne to Brisbane

1482
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
Thank you for calling and waiting to hear the emotion your voice Rachel please call back again God bless you and thanks for staying up lesoto show

1483
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:18,015
Airline you're up next they wasn't what she said it's what I was what people are already saying

1484
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
So

1485
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,903
She starts crying there at the end of the call but what she's putting forth is that

1486
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:29,023
Being set on purpose in order for the New World Order

1487
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
Create a

1488
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,119
High-Speed Rail Line throughout the country

1489
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
And

1490
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
It's all based on

1491
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
Maybe

1492
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
A slicker

1493
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
A promotional campaign

1494
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
Guess you could say it now World City

1495
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,455
You could say that can't say something like that without it meaning something

1496
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
We have thousand

1497
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,527
Years of human history of

1498
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
People saying eggs

1499
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
Exactly that the new world

1500
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,159
Did you could you could say that it's a new world order thing

1501
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,951
Or you could also

1502
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
Take the words a little different

1503
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:04,095
Currently like you consider things like London New York those are World City

1504
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:09,215
Those are cities that are part of the their Metropolitan they're they're part of the Worlds

1505
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
Community as opposed to

1506
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,335
The lesser extent that a small town

1507
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,663
So Wong Kong is a world City

1508
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,991
Right you can say that this is a new

1509
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
World City

1510
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:26,367
You could look at it that has the promotional campaign being about

1511
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:29,183
We're going to build up Brisbane to the point where

1512
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
It is

1513
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,255
Relevant on the global scale

1514
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
Yeah you could see it that way instead

1515
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,863
She takes it as a cube that novices the globalist

1516
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,679
Coming in and taking over Brisbane

1517
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
And it's just like

1518
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
I just feel very sad

1519
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
For her because

1520
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
Clearly Effexor this emotionally

1521
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
But I do feel like

1522
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,735
What she's bringing to the table is irresponsible the

1523
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
Conjecture of

1524
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,295
The Arts

1525
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
All this is arson

1526
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,647
And it's all a conspiracy in order to build this route

1527
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
But

1528
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
Alex is going out to break

1529
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,999
And as soon as he comes back from break

1530
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,815
Those details are now his narrative

1531
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:13,471
Is mounting that the mega fires in Australia

1532
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,871
Orchestrated by multinational forces to clear out she corridors

1533
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:26,271
Future development and four light rail going in that's being financed by the comment

1534
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
Chinese

1535
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:32,671
So he just has this caller who's called in with some

1536
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:37,279
Speculation that she's giving him secondhand from weird conspiracy blogs

1537
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,863
I found a post on Reddit as part of this

1538
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
This is not good

1539
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,495
No big deal

1540
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
Natural thing

1541
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
Now the Chinese

1542
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,359
Evidence is mounting

1543
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,407
Now the Chinese an International Group

1544
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
Fires on purpose

1545
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,343
I don't want to make fun of

1546
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
She's she's dealing with a mess

1547
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
Tragedy

1548
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,951
And unfortunately

1549
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
In that

1550
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
Reaction to itzy

1551
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
He's just

1552
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Didn't like

1553
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
Push towards this

1554
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Is awful information

1555
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
And so

1556
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,959
How to how to like balance

1557
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
An actual tragedy

1558
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,823
With what your imaginary reasons

1559
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
And then tube

1560
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Call Alex

1561
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Is

1562
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
So

1563
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,223
It's compounding the tragic

1564
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,831
All you're really doing is ensuring that nothing will be done to help

1565
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Word solver

1566
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
In the future

1567
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Locked up

1568
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,303
Alex is making this stuff up evidence is mounting

1569
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,399
That's the fastest I think I've ever seen that Fox News

1570
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,727
Tucker Carlson says something stupid and then the next morning

1571
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,543
Some people are saying that the evidence

1572
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Right but there's other evidence

1573
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Is there

1574
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,407
With all the viewers out the

1575
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,479
It's not like I'm just saying this is my opinion

1576
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
There's a big story up on Drudge Report.

1577
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:07,135
Cam from Summit. Net

1578
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,951
Deliberately starting the brush fires it's a big article

1579
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,487
Got the police

1580
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Got the newscast

1581
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,607
Sting reporting on the fact

1582
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,679
That is almost all deliberate arson

1583
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,007
I just people burning with left their crops to put

1584
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
Done

1585
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Watch it unfold

1586
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
That was

1587
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
What hour will

1588
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
MS

1589
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
That's a contradiction of how you started

1590
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,855
Don't deal with that at all

1591
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,671
But look the article that Alex is talking about on Drudge

1592
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,487
Is on Summit. News it was written by Paul Joseph Watson

1593
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:47,071
This is kind of the same thing as Alex just reporting on his own coverage

1594
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
Which would normally be like alright let's

1595
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
Dismiss this out of hand

1596
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,495
But I wanted to check in on the article to get a sense of the information PJ dubs

1597
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,775
Is bringing to the table

1598
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Firstly

1599
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:03,455
The headline of that article or the article that's up on some of that Australian police say arsonist and lightning

1600
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
To blame for bushfires not climbing

1601
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
How to change

1602
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Then

1603
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
The sub-headline is quote

1604
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,879
Sit down global warming alarmists

1605
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
This is a little weird

1606
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,951
First of all because of the tone

1607
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,487
Is this supposed to be reporting

1608
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,303
Or is it a dishy block Paul slams people

1609
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,095
Because it definitely sounds like the ladder

1610
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:25,471
He's trying to step into that because I guess

1611
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,567
The other issue is that even if some of the fires might have been set by arson

1612
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,383
And others were started by lightning

1613
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,199
That in no way invalidates the argument the climate proponents

1614
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:41,599
That only refutes the strawman argument that Alex and Paul Joseph Watson are using to attack climate change advocate

1615
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
Play me the people are saying the climate-change literally started

1616
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
The fires

1617
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,791
It's really easy to win an argument when you just pretend you're appointed to saying something they're not

1618
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
Yes how exactly would claw

1619
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
Climate change startup

1620
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,935
Matches do they think

1621
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,215
Climate change

1622
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
It like it's the Earth gets

1623
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,055
Hotter than some things are just so hot they burn

1624
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,175
I don't know because they're not clear about what

1625
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
People are saying just seem like they're being

1626
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
A fleabag about

1627
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,575
So I'm going to look at this article and

1628
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,391
And I don't believe that it proves the point that it's making

1629
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
But I want to clarify

1630
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Before I

1631
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,463
Get into this

1632
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Even if

1633
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
Every single fire was started by arson

1634
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,375
That doesn't refute the climate change Ark

1635
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
It really does

1636
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,775
This is not really even engaging with that level of things

1637
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
This is just trying to see what Paul is up

1638
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
In the article Paul rights quote

1639
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,431
Police are now working on the premise

1640
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
Arson is to blame for a bunch of the devastation caused

1641
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
Does this brush Bushfire season

1642
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,319
Report 7 News

1643
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,367
This is a reference to a tweet

1644
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,927
7News posted on January 3rd along with

1645
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
The video news

1646
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:55,071
The news report includes footage from police representative but he doesn't say anything about the scale of arson

1647
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,399
In fact in the video the reporter who's doing the peace

1648
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
He talks about the

1649
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
Suspicions of arsenic

1650
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,287
And you talk about how it turns out it was actually like

1651
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
It's not that far

1652
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,871
The only proof here is something that's in the tweet

1653
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Itself

1654
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,455
And I can't really find

1655
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
Fancy asian of that quote

1656
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,527
Or anything past that

1657
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,087
So I decided to check out 7 News

1658
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
Twitter account

1659
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
And there's plenty of coverage of

1660
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
The fire is on

1661
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Videos post

1662
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
The Press

1663
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,743
Princess being held by police and fire officials

1664
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
And wouldn't you know it

1665
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,327
None of them are about how this is mostly arson

1666
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,399
Tweets about a couple fires being considered

1667
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,215
Suspicious but nothing on the scale of what Alex has put in for

1668
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:37,567
There's also a whole lot of coverage about how two people were struck by lightning on the same

1669
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Someday though

1670
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
We're considering light

1671
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Get started

1672
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Pates

1673
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
The most arson you can have

1674
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
Have right if you get struck by lightning and

1675
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
Get lit on fire and then

1676
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,647
Trip and start a massive

1677
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
Bushfire

1678
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,767
There's a lot of coverage

1679
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
This to people being struck by lightning

1680
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:06,751
It looked at odds are slim that guy looking at a double rainbow got a whole day of newspapers so

1681
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Now again I want to be clear

1682
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:13,151
Paul's anti climate change argument is not made by showing of some fires were started by arson

1683
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,015
That doesn't matter to the larger point at all because the real Point people are making is just a climate change affect

1684
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,063
Persevere

1685
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
That being said

1686
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,207
Article to see if you was making a good argument against even the strawman

1687
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
No

1688
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:34,911
Alex exciting is number of almost 200 people arrested for arson but that's not even in this article that Paul wrote

1689
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
Who wrote another one

1690
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Or maybe he

1691
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,591
He could have written the second article at the topic

1692
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,151
I'm not sure but I decided to try and track that down

1693
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
This comes from right-wing blogs like zerohedge and post-millennial recovering an article in the

1694
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,159
Which purports that since the beginning of November 183 people

1695
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
Have been

1696
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,511
Charged or cautioned for Bushfire related offense

1697
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,375
However the article also says that only 24 have actually been arrested

1698
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,655
Biddeford deliberately set

1699
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
Setting fires

1700
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,775
The rest of them were probably given a ticket for flicking a cigarette butt in a high fire hazard

1701
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Area

1702
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Which courses

1703
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Not good but not the same

1704
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
An article in MSN seems to indicate

1705
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
The 47 of these people at work

1706
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,039
Exactly that situation to starting a cigarette or match

1707
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Inappropriately

1708
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,135
And 53 of them were people cited for not following

1709
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,415
Complete fire ban

1710
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,743
So they might have been making a campfire or something like that

1711
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,047
These numbers Alex's you are using

1712
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
Completely misleading

1713
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:39,167
You're meant to make it seem like they're tons and tons of arsonist out there and that's all

1714
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
What's going on

1715
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
That's not the case

1716
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,031
This post millennial article on the subject

1717
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Concludes quote

1718
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,151
That's 183 people who have been arrested for arson results

1719
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
Catastrophic bushfires displacement property lost

1720
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,759
People and animals

1721
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,087
You can't you can't say

1722
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,159
It's at very least in a dreadful overslept

1723
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:00,927
Occasion

1724
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,999
Some of these people who are arrested

1725
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
Starting fires

1726
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,583
They might be completely unrelated to

1727
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
The bushfires

1728
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
Princeton

1729
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,655
Two separate arson

1730
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
Took place on January 4th

1731
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
5th in Elizabeth North

1732
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,519
One on each side of a duplex

1733
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
These work just completely old-fashioned arson

1734
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
One day was once the next day it was Abby other

1735
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
I don't know

1736
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,855
They did arrest the guy who was holed up on a roof

1737
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,391
So in that neighborhood so

1738
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,951
Pretty good sensitivity

1739
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,255
You might like that has nothing to do with the larger tires

1740
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,655
At least one of these people whose arrested was a 36-year old man who set a fire in

1741
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
Johnsonville which was

1742
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,471
Contains that's not really related

1743
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
It's the larger situation

1744
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,615
Two teens were arrested for arson on January 5th because they were trying to break into a shed

1745
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
They were trying to rob

1746
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Which has nothing to do with

1747
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,271
There was another case in Melbourne

1748
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
Of a guy who's

1749
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
Arrested for arson

1750
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
But that was part of a fact

1751
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
He was trying to

1752
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
Maybe cause a distraction in order to

1753
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
One of them was a 50

1754
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Before your old man who was using

1755
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,583
Power Tools in Barstow

1756
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,863
Parkwood cause Sparks

1757
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,423
It's edifier Paul would know that if he consulted

1758
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,239
Is primary source 7 News who covered the topic

1759
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,567
7 news also reported on a 79 year old man who was arrested

1760
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
Super setting fires who's believe

1761
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
To have dementia

1762
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
The point here is we don't know the

1763
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,479
Stances of the 24 people who arrest

1764
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Open for delivery

1765
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
Play setting fires

1766
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,575
And this goes back to November

1767
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,415
Not necessarily related to the situation

1768
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,975
And it would be irresponsible to jump

1769
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
Too many conclusion

1770
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,095
Irresponsible

1771
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
Tantamount to

1772
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:49,471
A massive scapegoating campaign that could seriously get somebody killed

1773
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
More than you know

1774
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,871
Look if somebody if they put a like if we're talking about the Boston bombings

1775
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
Situation where they just put a random person

1776
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
Picture up in there like

1777
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
This is prob

1778
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
Probably the person did it

1779
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,295
Imagine if it was your entire fun

1780
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
Continent was on fire

1781
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,671
There are probably some indication

1782
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:14,047
They're probably at least some people who are deliberately setting fires and are pretty f***** up

1783
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,351
Do they call them firebugs

1784
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,911
It does seem like

1785
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,239
There are some people who are just

1786
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,031
Oriented that way

1787
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
Setting fires true

1788
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,407
I am also some of the people might be trying to create independent

1789
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Blackburn's where they

1790
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
Think that what they're doing

1791
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
Helpful

1792
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
But that's a possibility

1793
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
I don't know if that's

1794
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
The case might be making that up

1795
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,879
Right now Alex doesn't know either

1796
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,695
He has no information to go on but he's relying on

1797
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,255
Misrepresented headlines to craft a narrative about the

1798
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Is tragedy

1799
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
Biddies

1800
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,583
All these people are just

1801
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,655
And you're totally right to is really good

1802
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Matt is that scapegoating LMAO

1803
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,751
Because there are people who are getting arrested

1804
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Stood for this

1805
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
And from the articles that I've seen

1806
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,359
Wisely I believe

1807
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,431
A lot of the identities are not God

1808
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,271
Because you could imagine how that could get like so incredibly odd control

1809
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,671
Guy who said a fire for whatever he did Johnsonville that contain

1810
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,511
Like you imagined

1811
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,327
And now it's

1812
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,887
Yeah no it could be incredibly

1813
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,679
Yeah cuz you

1814
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,959
Look I just lost

1815
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
1.2 million dollars in property

1816
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Yesterday

1817
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
So guess what this guy's got arson

1818
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
In-N-Out

1819
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,663
And the other issue

1820
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,479
It would be dangerous

1821
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,247
Like scapegoat

1822
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,831
Stop is it according to the BBC there between 52 and

1823
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
T4000

1824
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
Bushfires in Australia every year

1825
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
13% of those are deliberately

1826
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
Lisset

1827
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:50,559
And half of those that are deliberately sat are set by people who are under

1828
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
21

1829
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
Which make some

1830
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
Playing with fire

1831
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
And if

1832
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
Some of the

1833
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
The instances of

1834
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
The people who are arrested

1835
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,847
Fire-related offenses are

1836
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
Like 50

1837
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
Teen

1838
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,967
That you could call you Rosa Mendes consequences in their life

1839
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,759
4

1840
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,575
I mean you obviously got to teach him not to do that

1841
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,927
I don't want to create a Frankenstein's monster situation where the town is

1842
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:22,303
Please, Lady a lady tweeted a bad joke about Africa and lost her entire life imagine if

1843
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,375
Somebody just decided that you caused a Bushfire

1844
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
Destroyed

1845
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,959
Oh man-seok to some of this up into

1846
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
Conclude

1847
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,847
Some instances of arson

1848
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,015
Is relevant to the actual gigantic fires that are going on is unclear at this point

1849
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
Enter reported as such as

1850
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
Irresponsible

1851
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
Picture whether or not a fire was started by arson is irrelevant

1852
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
The issues The climate-change Advocate

1853
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
It's a brand new but

1854
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,791
I decided to engage with this a little bit

1855
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
And it seems like something Alex's obsessed

1856
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
It appears

1857
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,191
Do you know like I said there aren't some fires are intentionally set

1858
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
But Oz

1859
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,007
Filling the gaps here with his fantasy

1860
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
That's bad

1861
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Yeah

1862
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
That's real bad

1863
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,127
That's so annoying

1864
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,431
That's so annoying that whole like

1865
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
Are you guys thinking

1866
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
It's climate change that's doing

1867
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,527
And

1868
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
It's at

1869
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,159
It's just like if let's say if Alex was a witch

1870
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,951
Right and we had to burn

1871
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,535
I don't want to but the Lord says that it he would agree

1872
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
That's

1873
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Bad

1874
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
That would be 10

1875
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:36,543
Imagine if that was all if that witch burning was also surrounded by everybody that you've ever loved who is

1876
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,895
Split on fire as well and then surrounding that was every building

1877
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,431
And they were all covered in gas

1878
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,967
That's the climate change

1879
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,271
It doesn't matter if you like them on

1880
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
So

1881
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,855
Leaving outside he's a witch

1882
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:56,255
The interesting thing is that like they don't crystallize what the argument there were shooting is that climate change

1883
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,607
People are putting forth and so this argument that I gave those people setting fires

1884
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
It doesn't do anything.

1885
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,167
To the climate change argue

1886
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
But it does

1887
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Contradict

1888
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Alex is

1889
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,519
Prior

1890
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
The only thing that's

1891
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,359
Be refuted is things that Alex is already said

1892
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
So that's cool

1893
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,687
Get to know that

1894
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
You can really

1895
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,991
You synthesize new information

1896
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
And at it as a good job

1897
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
And now he complains more about

1898
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
Golden Globes

1899
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,719
Caroline then I'll get those clips I mention

1900
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Phoenix

1901
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,351
Insufferably obnoxious with his

1902
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,911
Fake autistic Accu does everywhere

1903
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,959
What

1904
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
He gets up there and talks about donating

1905
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
Flying on private jets all the time

1906
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
You really believe that bad

1907
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,455
Then

1908
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:53,599
Dockside

1909
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,351
California dumps the most deadly fluoride the water

1910
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
10:00 weather chemicals in it

1911
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Seattle waiver

1912
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,311
With one billionth of what's in the water

1913
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,384
So you out of existence

1914
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,248
The Golden Globes now they're not for you not for me I don't want

1915
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
So as for props

1916
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
65 Oz

1917
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:29,952
Backing up the thing or California has a waiver to put fluoride in the water

1918
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,768
65 requires that people provide warnings for the present

1919
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,816
Certain chemicals and toxins in the product

1920
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,912
They sell it wouldn't need a waiver for fluoride because it's

1921
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,752
It's not on the list of ingredients that require a warning even if that was relevant

1922
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Alex's

1923
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Making that up

1924
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,128
The issue here is that California has far more rigorous standards for supplements

1925
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
It's been a lot of the rest of the

1926
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,224
It also has by far the largest population

1927
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,064
If Alex doesn't meet their standards with his product

1928
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,624
He misses out on approximately 39 billion

1929
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
Potential customer

1930
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,488
But it also cost him a bunch more to produces down pills

1931
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
If it weren't for California prop 65 his profit margins would be

1932
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Be a lot higher

1933
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,192
Because you can just make trash and sell it and that's always complaining about

1934
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
Upset about

1935
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Saveriano

1936
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,544
I have to have

1937
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,848
So much less light in my products

1938
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,432
Because of California's prop 65 and it makes me really pissed off

1939
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:27,296
Is insufferable as actors and celebrities to be for the most part

1940
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:31,136
I wish more conservative knew that the main reason they are

1941
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,928
Their fervor to hate

1942
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
California's drugged-up

1943
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,256
Because rich people don't make as much money

1944
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
8

1945
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,560
It is a big part of it

1946
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,144
So now we learn more about Australia

1947
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
In this next clip

1948
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
And received

1949
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
The crystallization of this

1950
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
Narrative

1951
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Has happened

1952
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Alex is now

1953
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,848
Report 100-percent reporting

1954
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,896
And he said it wasn't his opinion

1955
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,248
The chai, government and China's right there

1956
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,576
Really

1957
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:06,976
China runs Australia

1958
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:13,376
Right over there in the middle of it as a place with babe so

1959
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Cars are very strategic they are arson

1960
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:21,056
So I'm sure what's the Golden Globes last night in a regular globe

1961
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,640
He was like holyshit Australia's really close to China

1962
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:27,456
Also ensure Queen Elizabeth is going to be upset to hear the news

1963
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,272
The China runs

1964
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:36,160
Clip is important because Alex is asserting that these fires are arson and we're done strategically as up back

1965
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,464
This is not a person put in for that opinion

1966
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
He's reporting

1967
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
And he has no reason to do that

1968
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,096
An hour earlier you saying is just natural its

1969
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,656
What happens if armor sets

1970
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
The globalist want

1971
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
Do you know they want to tell you

1972
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,312
In Spanish lesson an hour on air

1973
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,616
He's completely changed his tune and now he's

1974
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,688
Pretending start the show saying it was no big deal

1975
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,224
Now this is a gigantic

1976
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,600
It's the biggest but the Chinese government is paying arsonist set fires to clear the area and

1977
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,392
Prepare for High-Speed Rail lines in

1978
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,440
Agenda 2030 whatever

1979
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
It's so easy it is for Alex

1980
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512
Convince himself of something

1981
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,792
The thing

1982
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,816
But I want to highlight

1983
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,376
Is that this is not a product of his stupidity

1984
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
This is striking while the iron is

1985
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
This is crap

1986
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
Alex sees an opportunity

1987
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
There's a massively traumatic world of

1988
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,360
Getting a lot of attention

1989
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,176
Have you seen it get a lot of play in the Golden Globes

1990
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,456
Set the perfect place

1991
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
For him to plant his flag

1992
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,808
That's what connects his initial position with his new one

1993
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
They're both

1994
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
Contrarian

1995
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,136
To the point to the rest of the world

1996
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,672
Position

1997
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Annie's

1998
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Pushing back

1999
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
They're meant to be opt

2000
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Subversive

2001
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,376
A that some kind of elevated understanding of what's going on in the rest of the world

2002
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
That no one else has access

2003
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,752
When the show began Alex didn't have a good angle on the conspiracy

2004
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,544
That's because he's not that creative

2005
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,104
He's still pretty much every idea he's ever had from

2006
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,384
Is 911 prediction

2007
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
Hillary for prison bumper

2008
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,736
Stickers to the catch phrase about the answered 1984

2009
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
1776

2010
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:06,784
Steals everything

2011
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
Alex knaub

2012
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
Create

2013
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
You can only absorb

2014
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,952
So the best you could do at the beginning of the show was doobie a contrarian

2015
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
Is that you don't understand how controlled Burns work

2016
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,816
You getting all hysterical about climate

2017
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,936
He said he knows that this will just lead to better crop

2018
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,264
You got the call from a Nutty Australian lady

2019
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,104
Anyway she reads blogs he doesn't even have time to read anymore

2020
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
So she repeats the popular

2021
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,432
Conspiracy lying to me recognizes

2022
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
That's probably got more juice in it

2023
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,504
That is condescending

2024
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
That's a good stuff

2025
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,368
This is how it sounds to me

2026
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
I might be wrong

2027
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,696
For sure is that Alex isn't based

2028
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,976
This narrative on anything

2029
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,792
He's making a strategic decision based on what he thinks

2030
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,328
To make him more interesting

2031
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,120
And probably lead to a better

2032
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
Financial

2033
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
For attention

2034
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,728
Or anytime there's

2035
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,008
Hot button issues

2036
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
Staking some sort of a

2037
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Proclaim

2038
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,616
Latest counter to what everyone else believes

2039
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
Is a Wade

2040
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,712
Trion filter

2041
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
That's all this

2042
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,040
That you see how it how

2043
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
Bill

2044
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
His ability to go from

2045
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
Like listening to her

2046
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
Thinking man I wish I

2047
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
I thought of that

2048
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,792
2 an hour later being like man I'm so glad I thought of

2049
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
I'm so glad

2050
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
I'm so glad that I am

2051
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:29,216
So well-trained and no Global stir up to that I was able to deduce

2052
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,752
I thought of it

2053
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,640
So Alex is now securely in that position

2054
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,576
Carbon taxes to fix all this

2055
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,136
All the fires arson

2056
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,184
And they busted a bunch of people

2057
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,768
Waiting till it dries time of the year

2058
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
Setting the fire

2059
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
Burning up all these corridors

2060
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,144
Where the Chinese are putting in light rail

2061
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,192
So now you can see how the narrative is evolve

2062
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,264
Yep where is it the beginning of the show

2063
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
It's no big deal

2064
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,360
Biggest fire ever

2065
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,432
And that changes because now he has an angle on it

2066
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
Depended on the globalist

2067
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,552
It's no big deal to him at sapphires or big until he has an angle

2068
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,600
Now he's found a way to blame his enemies

2069
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,624
Crucial that the event

2070
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,904
Be as big as possible

2071
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
You can't do bigger than biggest ever

2072
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,488
Now we sing the

2073
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,560
The police say that all the fires are arson which is not true

2074
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
And they busted people in the act

2075
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,400
Which is at least not accurate in the way Alex

2076
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,448
He has his motive

2077
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
Thanks that color

2078
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:37,568
The Chinese

2079
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,360
He's got a conspiracy that he gets

2080
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
CL about

2081
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,248
It doesn't happen too often but this is a really clear-cut case of Alex improvising

2082
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
Conspiracy

2083
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
This feels really similar to the Boston Bomber

2084
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,368
Stuff where you can almost see the gears moving

2085
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,416
His head is honestly sick

2086
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,696
Affectionate

2087
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,536
It is unfair how about a symmetrical

2088
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,072
Infowar is

2089
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,888
You know like we have all the info

2090
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,448
He's like a high counter you with none

2091
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Somehow I'm

2092
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
Still winning

2093
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
F****** unfit

2094
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Fair

2095
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,592
And then you get them under oath

2096
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,128
Sunnyside shows

2097
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,944
I just talked about what a thing

2098
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:20,576
Another caller from Australia is

2099
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,856
20/30 globalist

2100
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
Florida

2101
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,672
I we don't need to listen to what time today because it's

2102
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
Just heard of them began during

2103
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,024
Conspiracy basically

2104
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,072
I want to play this

2105
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,096
Sklep because

2106
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
I think

2107
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
This is

2108
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,448
Sort of people say

2109
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Stuff like this

2110
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,008
And just like you shouldn't be listening

2111
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,056
Two people also believe these things

2112
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,640
Really don't you think

2113
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,504
Coming from

2114
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,928
Mobile

2115
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,400
Infowars.com Carolina thank you so much

2116
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
U-Haul

2117
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:12,288
Somebody who's talking about this Chinese globalist

2118
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:18,688
Conspiracy for Light Rail and all this stuff

2119
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,968
Lazarbeam

2120
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:26,368
You kind of have to be like okay I should take both of those things as being equally

2121
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
Play Store

2122
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,768
I got to say if you're going to go around with the laser beam stuff

2123
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:37,632
I'm going to treat your thoughts about the light rail

2124
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,936
Conspiracy with the exact same to stain

2125
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
Dismissive

2126
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
I love that

2127
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,664
Rye love and loving Australian person downplaying what should be

2128
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,736
The single most terrifying thing that you can describe

2129
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
Like if what you say is

2130
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
She believes what

2131
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,576
You saying is true

2132
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,904
She thinks somebody use laser beams to set a fire

2133
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,584
Where are the laser beams coming

2134
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,376
Is it UFO

2135
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
I heard that I was like

2136
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,848
I feel like Alex has got to be disappointed but going into brake like he's got his

2137
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,152
I got lazarbeam

2138
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
I did not cut that

2139
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
Call us sooner

2140
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
Jesus what am I doing

2141
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,272
Anyways

2142
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:30,368
He's basically done with the Australia portion

2143
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
The shower now

2144
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:31,904
And

2145
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,952
He gets back to talking about A-Rod

2146
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,232
Sharan

2147
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,560
You know on the on the next day on Friday

2148
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,864
You got to get Steve pieczenik in there cuz he's got

2149
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,472
Got to be done

2150
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
I'm still not over that by the way

2151
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
What

2152
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:53,408
That the Holocaust didn't happen

2153
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,712
I feel really guilty

2154
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:57,760
Guilty about like

2155
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,320
Not knowing I had no reason to know that

2156
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:04,160
Believe

2157
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
Besides show for quite a while

2158
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,768
These sorts of Revelations about it make me feel

2159
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
Pretty

2160
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
Mixed

2161
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:14,144
About 23

2162
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,728
I feel like if we found out that to someone else

2163
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
That

2164
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,080
You know we know I guess like

2165
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
She has

2166
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,664
Definitely some 80's metal cleaning

2167
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,480
But I haven't heard her go that far

2168
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,760
Platform people who deny

2169
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
For sure

2170
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,464
In this entire Community I just assumed that a matter of anti-Semitism until

2171
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,072
How do we Now operate from a position

2172
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,608
Of not just assuming

2173
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
Eventually these people are going to

2174
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,704
The Nighthawks

2175
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,728
How do we get

2176
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:59,456
The benefit of the doubt for a little while

2177
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,480
Eventually

2178
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
Not right

2179
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,552
That's

2180
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:08,160
You just don't know how many people deny the Holocaust until York

2181
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
Confronted with

2182
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:15,072
Rustic relative acquaintances

2183
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,888
Devon on Friday

2184
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,912
Powder to get to

2185
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:23,520
Another geopolitical expert

2186
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,360
A for a while but now he's coming back into the pool

2187
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,896
And that is Joel skousen

2188
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
So Alex

2189
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Introduces

2190
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Joel

2191
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:35,552
Here's somebody who definitely believes the Holocaust happen and wide-ranging knowledge

2192
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,624
Tom

2193
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,184
He's the editor of worldfree4u.com to X1

2194
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,000
Shut up for Marine Corps officer and Naval aviator

2195
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,840
Globbles from 60 70 years

2196
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,632
I wish we wouldn't even

2197
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,008
Bachata

2198
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:59,104
So skousen zone for an interview and I don't have any clips of it cuz f*** that dude

2199
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,152
Exceedingly boring

2200
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:05,760
It's just that he comes on and says that every single thing is a false flag that's like all he does

2201
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,832
He's on to tell Alex that traps f***** up

2202
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,392
And fell for a globalist trick by killing soleimani

2203
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,232
It appears that he thinks that this was a deep State setup

2204
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:18,560
Now Trump is being a real dick on Twitter and making things worse

2205
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,888
It's dumb interview but Alex's pretty receptive to skousen

2206
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,912
Anti-trump message

2207
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,240
Particularly given the circumstances where I was realizing

2208
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,312
Provoke Irani rock kind of

2209
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
With his threat

2210
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
They pay us

2211
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,992
If there's a recipe for a Dismount from trump it feels like this could be a passport

2212
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,320
Who is untainted from the time that I was spent with

2213
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,368
Cuz he had credit

2214
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,024
And he still has a good rapport with Alex

2215
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
Respect

2216
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Between them hasn't been to me

2217
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,936
Is it a good person to latch Your Wagon to now right now

2218
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
Plus

2219
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,288
Joel skousen is anti-communist of royalty

2220
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,848
Cuz he is W Cleon skousen to nephew

2221
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,128
If I were Alex

2222
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,152
I would make a move

2223
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Now

2224
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,736
Get on board you have Joel skousen

2225
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:14,624
You might got to get rid of Steve that going back to that wild night of 1000 is still there

2226
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,672
Get back to your anti-communist bulshit

2227
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,696
With this like

2228
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
This is a rock

2229
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
You can build on

2230
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,792
If you want to save whatever you can

2231
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,072
The rest of its

2232
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
Just going to be destroyed

2233
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,632
Like it's the right the rest of this

2234
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,912
Is going to fall apart

2235
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Just naturally

2236
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
It's doing it it's

2237
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,496
That you have built your house on

2238
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,336
So I hate to give advice

2239
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,872
Alex could work

2240
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
Leaving Trump with skousen

2241
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Is your Best Buy

2242
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,248
Mayhaw

2243
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,296
Leaving the planet with

2244
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,320
Klingon skousen

2245
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,160
Would probably be the better way you're not going to know

2246
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,696
Propelled heart

2247
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
I stab at the IRS

2248
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:51,744
That's what else you got

2249
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
We doing this

2250
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
How to speak Klingon

2251
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,120
So I lied I actually do have one clip

2252
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,960
And at its them talking about qanon

2253
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Skousen

2254
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Blossom Porton

2255
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
Alex

2256
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
In this clip

2257
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
Actually

2258
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,480
Confirmed the theory that we've had for a long

2259
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
Nothing

2260
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
True

2261
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,624
This is a pure disinformation expert

2262
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:26,816
Supporters

2263
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,800
Because you're definitely a delusional issue

2264
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
Sucking up show many good people

2265
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,224
So Alex is literally saying that his plan was to

2266
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,064
To co-opt and then use it as a vehicle to

2267
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,904
Pretend que said certain things should you be saying this out loud

2268
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,208
I'm inside.

2269
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,024
That would you keep up in the brain

2270
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,816
I was planning to defraud people

2271
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,352
You don't let that one out

2272
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,656
That's what we've been through

2273
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,728
Attempt exactly that

2274
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Like this

2275
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
Alex is basically saying

2276
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,176
I had a grand plan to use this very successful in order to manipulate my audio

2277
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
And it didn't work

2278
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,760
Why would you say that I have no idea

2279
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
Because it's a because book

2280
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,160
I think that's the real I think that's what we should take away from this

2281
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,440
Is it this point nobody's

2282
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Alex

2283
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,072
In Subway able to rationalize this it's the greater good I would be

2284
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,632
Be using pure

2285
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,168
To give good messages

2286
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
And that's just delusion

2287
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,008
Using it to sell your pills

2288
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,312
He's literally saying I was going

2289
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,128
To defraud I was going to lie to everybody

2290
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
That was my

2291
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,224
And if I had done that Joel

2292
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,784
I wouldn't be telling you about

2293
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,552
Kind of hoped

2294
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,576
To take over Cuba

2295
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
Now

2296
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
What's interest

2297
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,184
Think about this is if you look at the history it's

2298
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
Absolutely

2299
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:02,304
Very likely that he did make serious gestures to that

2300
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,704
Zach is one of them is a fake intelligence guy and then the other one is Jerome corsi was

2301
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,264
He started to become a big

2302
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
You guy

2303
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Really started

2304
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,336
To decode Q Clues

2305
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,872
He was going to write a book

2306
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:18,432
About

2307
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,040
Probably only ended because Q started

2308
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,856
Started turning on Coursey

2309
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:30,464
I think Zach and Coursey were both attempts

2310
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,232
2 coop

2311
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
That stinks

2312
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:35,328
And this is exactly what Alex's pattern throughout his career is

2313
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
The Tea Party

2314
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
Qanon Trump

2315
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,240
These are the things that he recognizes potential in

2316
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,288
And gets on board with in order to a

2317
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,056
Absorb them

2318
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,592
Or Co-op them in

2319
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
To his revenues

2320
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,944
That's the same way that I was talking about earlier

2321
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,248
Alex can't create he could only absorb

2322
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,296
This is the attack

2323
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,600
To do that Feud meaning that that was

2324
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Who's playing

2325
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,160
That's f***** up yeah yeah

2326
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,720
He's saying that he's like one of those cleaner fish

2327
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
For a shark

2328
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,280
That's all they can do is

2329
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:08,864
Egypt's where it swims around and cleans off the Sharks back

2330
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,400
I was thinking more than

2331
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:17,056
I thought

2332
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,336
So

2333
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,872
Alex while talking

2334
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
Skousen

2335
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:25,248
Do you know the ideas that Trump got set up by the Deep state in order to do this

2336
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,600
Alex starts to sort of manufacture excuses

2337
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,160
Completely make stuff up

2338
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,208
About what Trump was going

2339
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,744
Through in order to sort

2340
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:41,120
Trying to rationalize his the decision-making so he doesn't

2341
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
Was

2342
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:47,264
What's what's what's hurting level Trump's real numbers were way up and I agree

2343
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,360
So it looks like I'm you know I've been indicted

2344
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,920
Who wants to change the subject and I and I

2345
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
You guys just say

2346
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,864
Donald Trump

2347
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,632
Blamed

2348
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,800
And that's what I'm predicting so surprising Iraq he believes

2349
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:27,200
Stop

2350
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,832
Play activate Sleeper Cell

2351
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:40,512
When those things happened they didn't like you know they're helping Engineers old thing back

2352
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:44,352
Alex is making all that up wow that is a fantasy of his

2353
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:47,424
That is because

2354
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
He still needs

2355
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,472
To make the globalist

2356
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,008
The bad guy even if

2357
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,568
He is recognized in the Trump trying to extort a rock

2358
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Is.

2359
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
Okay

2360
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,640
So I think that what he's doing

2361
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,176
He's trying to

2362
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Judge

2363
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,736
Trump's actions

2364
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
By ascribing them

2365
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
To the global

2366
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:06,624
Now and the best he can do is that like Trump is gullible

2367
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
You got tricked

2368
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,672
Because he was so up

2369
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:12,000
What about the impeachment his numbers were going down

2370
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:12,768
And so he

2371
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,816
Political assassination

2372
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,584
Shouldn't be

2373
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,168
Okay but tell how you was put in that position it's

2374
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,728
There is look if the Democrats hadn't impeached

2375
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
Then he wouldn't have assassinated that guy

2376
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,568
Clearly that means it's

2377
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:28,640
The Democrats fault it's cockamamie nonsense I mean the best

2378
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:32,480
Best strategy I guess he feels that he has at this point is to

2379
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,272
To say that Trump is incredibly weak

2380
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
It is well

2381
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
Attention

2382
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,624
Potentially International crimes

2383
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
In order to

2384
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:42,208
Distract from an impeachment

2385
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,232
Exactly what

2386
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,256
Galesburg

2387
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,840
When all the time I don't know if this is nonsensical

2388
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,376
If it's leading to him

2389
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,680
Leaving it makes sense

2390
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,752
If not if you stand on board with Trump

2391
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
And

2392
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,800
Using these

2393
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,568
Sorts of

2394
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Thin

2395
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
F****** rhetoric

2396
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,944
In order to justify it I don't know

2397
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,736
I was listening to a little bit of the show.

2398
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,552
Today Show today

2399
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:10,880
And cuz I want to get a sense of like

2400
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
What's going on

2401
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,464
I just turned it on for a little bit he's screaming about how my

2402
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:20,864
Mike Pompeo

2403
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:26,496
F*** Pompeo I know that in order to do this show we both kinda

2404
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,032
Tacitly agreed that

2405
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,080
A razor should stay outside while we record

2406
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,872
Right right but this one

2407
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
Could not be

2408
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,736
Look at all the made-up nonsense that he

2409
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
He tries to

2410
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,040
Blast into one

2411
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,600
Sedation when it's just very simple

2412
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
He's a

2413
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,416
F****** evil dude

2414
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
It's you're so simple

2415
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:51,072
Exactly what we've told you he was he's a con man who has

2416
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:54,144
Psychopathy was willing to commit war crimes

2417
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,496
Like he said he wanted to do during the campaign he did say that about

2418
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:02,592
I think that's probably too and then also just be

2419
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,360
Not like

2420
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
Singular in the folks

2421
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
Like you also obviously has

2422
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Terrible

2423
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:11,040
Reality is like

2424
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
Yes this is

2425
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,624
Take all that aside

2426
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
He still responds

2427
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
Before this decision

2428
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
The Democrats impeached

2429
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,280
Even if the globalists quote-unquote

2430
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
Tricked him into doing

2431
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,352
Still his

2432
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,888
Responsibility

2433
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,656
President gets

2434
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,192
Tricked it doesn't count

2435
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,984
Don't you remember that was Nixon's to

2436
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
The buck stops

2437
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Over there

2438
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:35,360
The buck stops with the Democrats no matter f***

2439
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,176
Right so Alex is another gas

2440
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:41,248
Kris tanto paronto

2441
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,040
One of the survivors of Benghazi

2442
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,136
I think he's just on to promote his new podcast

2443
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:49,440
I don't know what is going on this is

2444
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,256
I'll be looking for guests this is a weird interview

2445
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:56,608
Call like I said he's one of the survivors of Benghazi

2446
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:00,192
The interview is not very interesting to me outside of

2447
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
Contos main point

2448
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,568
Which seems to be that he's not happy that people were calling the situation

2449
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
Timothy Rockey Embassy

2450
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,872
Another Benghazi

2451
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:12,992
He seems to take that personally which I think is fair play I have no problem with that ankle

2452
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:19,392
Because Alex was saying at the globalist

2453
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,696
So he's kind of guilty of exactly the

2454
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,720
Tonto is taken

2455
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,024
Issue it but for me this is a little bit of a

2456
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,048
Who cares situation

2457
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,608
All due respect to Tonto Forest Service

2458
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:33,728
And I definitely see where he's coming from your being the Benghazi Survivor you wouldn't want your experience to

2459
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
Be used as a political

2460
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,360
Also Alex tries to get Tanto to back him up that it's f***** up

2461
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,920
The Trump is going to pay for

2462
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,200
For the base for withdrawal

2463
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
What's that

2464
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,832
He sees he says he's seen us leave bases before and he's like

2465
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,368
That's a lot of money we're leaving behind

2466
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
It's the little one come

2467
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,488
Alright Alex is big hero guy that's on the show is

2468
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,768
Invalidating his

2469
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
Lying with Trump

2470
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,168
Downtown

2471
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
Stupid and pointless

2472
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,008
Alex does say one thing

2473
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:07,776
It's pretty funny

2474
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,080
Tanto paronto is our gas

2475
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:16,992
Thinking but again that's down for one of the heroes and survivors in Benghazi she pointed out that the man that died

2476
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,880
Fish

2477
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
Play gentlemen

2478
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,912
Almost nobody was getting award cuz it was

2479
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:41,568
Really President Obama

2480
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,384
You can't just do that

2481
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,944
Did you know that Obama gave up the most

2482
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,736
Presidential medal of freedom

2483
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,040
Advertisement

2484
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,576
BB. Number two on that list

2485
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,368
Reagan by 21 medals

2486
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,720
I was going over the last thing one thing that stuck out to me is it Obama's list of recipients

2487
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
Is pretty Broad

2488
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,816
From like Maya Angelou to John Glenn to Bishop Desmond

2489
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
722

2490
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
Blisters

2491
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
Mostly app

2492
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
Athletes

2493
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:10,496
Trump is giving out 14 Medals of freedom and 7 of them were two athletes

2494
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:14,336
The only non-athlete she's awarded are Orrin Hatch

2495
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:18,432
Edwin Meese rosewe Reagan attorney general had to resign after a corrupt

2496
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Options

Antonin Scalia

Economist and Trump advisor Arthur Laffer

2500
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,392
Posthumously

2501
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,232
There's also a former Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court Allen

2502
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:33,536
Paige who got an award but he was also

2503
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:39,936
Professional football player Nixon and Elvis were friends and Elvis still.

2504
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,728
Can get a presidential medal of freedom

2505
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,520
I guess that's

2506
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:47,360
That's f***** up Nexen also

2507
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,920
Everybody else a murderer's row of evil

2508
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
Truly

2509
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
If anybody

2510
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,016
Deserves the presidential medal of freedom

2511
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,296
Those six names

2512
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,344
Are the bottom of the list

2513
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,952
I suppose Eric Prince's down there and hatch

2514
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
Innocent witches

2515
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,816
Edwin meese

2516
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:09,888
I don't remember

2517
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Tiger Woods

2518
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
Tiger Woods

2519
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:18,336
Presidential medal of freedom aren't necessarily military awards

2520
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:22,432
Military figure in Trump has not at this point

2521
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:28,832
So even that all your magic imagine the next guy to commit a crime is going to get a medal

2522
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,112
Other Awards

2523
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
Surely Obama gave out some of those

2524
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,184
And of course eat

2525
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Legion

2526
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:39,072
Obama gave up plenty of Medals of Honor also which are specifically for a

2527
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,632
The point Alex wants to make is that

2528
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:46,496
The people at Benghazi have not been awarded any of these Metals yet

2529
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:48,032
But he's extending their points

2530
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,824
Far past the marker where it becomes a

2531
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
Complete lie

2532
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
Which it is

2533
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,664
It's completely if you want to just talk

2534
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,784
Specifically about the people who died in the survivors of Benghazi not getting these Awards yet

2535
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,320
You can have that conversation

2536
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,600
And it's what

2537
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,880
Tonto is bringing up and

2538
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:05,696
He does extended even to Trump not giving these

2539
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,000
Absolutism

2540
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
The fair conversation

2541
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,328
It's not fair when you turn into

2542
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:14,400
Obama's trying to demoralize the military by not giving out Awards

2543
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,168
It's just a lie

2544
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,240
They just

2545
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Don't

2546
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,568
Just don't like

2547
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,336
Anyting

2548
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
And everything that

2549
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,408
Could possibly be pinned on Obama

2550
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
Dice

2551
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:34,112
He's he's a he's just he's just a black president and it doesn't make him

2552
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,648
Infinitely evil

2553
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,952
It doesn't mean that he's not giving out

2554
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,768
Battles what's in saying to is that like

2555
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
That could be May

2556
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
Coming from Alex

2557
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Ever

2558
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,984
These criticisms they do come up

2559
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,776
For either lies or just

2560
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,312
Plead misrepresentation

2561
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,128
And you would think if you really wanted

2562
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
Make

2563
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,432
Hard-hitting

2564
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,456
She would go with

2565
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,736
Real criticism

2566
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,552
And somehow you don't

2567
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,576
You know it's it's

2568
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:09,440
A bad day to criticize if you're if you're a trump supporter

2569
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,232
The bad data criticized Obama's

2570
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,792
Expansion of the Drone program

2571
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,352
Without mentioning

2572
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,120
Yeah

2573
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:20,448
So we're one last that one time

2574
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,496
I'm so nosy

2575
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:27,872
So we have one last clip here and it's Alex get into wrapping things up

2576
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,640
With the sales

2577
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,176
And

2578
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,712
I find this to be Gray

2579
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,504
Our audience is an audience

2580
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,320
Incredibles

2581
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
We can Finance we can complete this year going the next year antifa

2582
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:44,768
Really want to shut us down don't let them win pokeweed stay in attack formation

2583
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:51,936
Yesterday was the last day of the super end-of-year magazine

2584
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:59,360
Sunday specials

2585
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,296
Jackson thing

2586
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:13,696
So you know a company is doing well under CEO is doing an ad reads they will never have sales like this unless we're going

2587
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,864
Like I always do it's totally because I'm super busy running

2588
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,424
Very healthy business that's not about to collapse

2589
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
That inspires confidence

2590
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,008
Also this episode

2591
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,544
On the 7th

2592
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,360
When I was listening to a little bit of the show

2593
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,896
They ran an ad

2594
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,992
Cut from this

2595
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:40,320
Is already in an ad on the 7th

2596
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:45,184
How busy are you like and he does things look like

2597
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,512
I tended to days because the editors have to put together the ad

2598
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:55,168
Editor was the put together then add the Arizona 7th

2599
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,704
Infowars

2600
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,472
Employees

2601
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:01,568
Up to this day clearly shows that whatever the holdup is is not

2602
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,336
What you say it at all

2603
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,640
Might be inventory Texas

2604
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,296
Texas is one of eight states in the United States where companies are taxed on all their carried over inventory at the end of the year

2605
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,576
The reasoning is

2606
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,648
The state doesn't want to

2607
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
Incentivize businesses

2608
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,232
Is to produce large amounts of inventory they can

2609
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,768
They can f*** with their workers

2610
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,816
Decreased hours and layoffs during

2611
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
Slower times

2612
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:29,728
Alex's letting you slip a little bit is gigantic sale at the end of the year was about a voice

2613
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,288
Inventory tax on the products left his Warehouse

2614
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
Come January

2615
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,384
That's some sleazy s*** right there but I would also

2616
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,688
Kind of bad that he did that because he can't afford to pay

2617
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
Hey those tax

2618
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,016
We're in the show Alex

2619
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,832
Cancel that new show that he launched Firepower

2620
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Because they couldn't

2621
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,880
Afford to pay the boar.

2622
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,464
They just launched that show like a month or two ago

2623
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,512
This is an impressive failure speed

2624
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:58,912
Wow David Knight is still managed to maintain his show for a couple years now and I'm certain that no one likes it and it is not

2625
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
Body positive

2626
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,704
Return-on-investment

2627
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:04,032
Either Alex isn't really bad financial Straits

2628
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
Right now

2629
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,848
And he had to manipulate his audience

2630
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,664
Is pills so you wouldn't have to pay taxes on

2631
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,944
Or

2632
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,248
He's doing okay but he's reached a point where

2633
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,784
Pretending that he's going out of business

2634
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,576
This is the only play he has left

2635
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
The milk sales out of his committed base

2636
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,648
Neither Ops

2637
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Action is great

2638
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,184
So

2639
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:21,952
Good luck Alex

2640
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:25,024
Hopefully 2019 is the last year you even have

2641
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,792
I think about him

2642
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
Inventory tax

2643
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:27,840
This is a mess

2644
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
Yeah whatever it is it

2645
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
He's manipulated his audio

2646
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,312
That's that's why I'll never I didn't know that a radio show could run

2647
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,104
The same way that mattress stores

2648
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,152
Going out of business

2649
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
Forever

2650
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,456
That's crazy

2651
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,736
Eventually that

2652
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,528
That thread will be less compelling

2653
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:50,624
Going to his audience I don't think it's a good long-term strategy

2654
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,416
The definition of diminishing returns

2655
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,440
Yeah

2656
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:59,328
This brings us to the end of the episode I think it's really interesting cuz you see like this pivot that happens

2657
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Just

2658
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,912
Over the course of like an hour

2659
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,704
Related to the Australian fires

2660
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,008
You see the bulshit you see the

2661
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Attacking

2662
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,312
The climate change

2663
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,848
Advocacy position

2664
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872
Bye

2665
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:16,480
Extraneous points that have nothing to do with the arguments being made

2666
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:17,504
You see

2667
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,064
Do that that's really fascinating to me

2668
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:20,832
And then

2669
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,648
You see this weird thing with a Ron

2670
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,696
Clearly has a line

2671
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,512
But also even if Trump is past that line

2672
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,048
He has to make it the globalist

2673
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,840
Yeah you can't allow

2674
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,656
It's too threatening to the last years of his life

2675
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
To accept that Trump

2676
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,752
Is doing these things because he wants to

2677
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,288
He said he was going

2678
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:45,920
So I think that's a really interesting development and I am

2679
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,944
See where that goes

2680
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,712
Speakers

2681
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,808
Combined circumstances are correct

2682
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,600
And they work in the right way

2683
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,880
I do think

2684
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,184
But if Trump carries on this way

2685
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:57,952
Continually

2686
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
Keeps

2687
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,000
Going down this road

2688
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
It could lead to Alex

2689
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Having to make

2690
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:02,816
Decision

2691
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,888
And I don't know I'm also

2692
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,704
I'm at the point where I'm so f****** Jaded by idea

2693
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:13,568
This'll get him to lie I know it's until until Trump doesn't have power

2694
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,104
That's it

2695
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:18,432
That's when he'll everybody everybody

2696
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:20,224
Trump is out of power be like

2697
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:26,624
And I could call of the things and I don't like the way

2698
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:30,464
But he's not going to criticize him

2699
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,024
It's very possible until I will see

2700
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,584
I don't know

2701
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,120
Never leaves

2702
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
