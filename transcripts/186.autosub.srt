00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
I made it all the way

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
Just a couple of

4
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Couples

5
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Cheese omelette

6
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
Also think about the Narrows

7
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
Trying really hard

8
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,648
Destroyer Cambridge

9
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Is it corrupt

10
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
So Jordan This is a show where we now know about each other's days and I know a bit about outside

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,056
That is correct play our little game

12
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
A little game

13
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
You know

14
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,528
Now I feel adrift

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Read it I read

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
Unplugged and plugged back in everything on our soundboard separation for something we're about to unveil here in a little bit

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
Severe problem

18
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,912
In terms of our headphones thrown off a little bit by like my headphones dropping out

19
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752

00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,184
You could tell people talk to your parties at your policy want

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
People love hearing

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
About 15

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Cocktail parties

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Conversation

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Like how much does your condo cost

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Great conversation

39
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Price is Right

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Condo

41
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,904

Anna Thompson fun stuff

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
You know what when we go back into the past where

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
It's one of the good app

50
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Weirdos

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,000

00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
Facebook

56
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,528
Post you made on Facebook clearly indicate

57
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
Like the moment they figured it out there like

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
We got them this time

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
I found a 10-year loophole

60
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Before we end

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Talking

62
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Weirdo

63
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Alright

64
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,063
Necessary

65
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Apparently somebody comes after him and he's going to mercilessly get brutally

66
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
Has your best bet as far as it goes

67
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Not

68
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,551
Whoa whoa whoa

69
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
Always carried a hammer with you

70
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
Murder somebody with it

71
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:28,191
Your nails

72
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,055
Road flare

73
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,943
Text Caleb

74
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,783
Do I dare someone with a road flare

75
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
I was hoping Alex would be like

76
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Like you back

77
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Think about things you should have in your car

78
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Blankets

79
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,167
What if it's called your car breaks down

80
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
First sure

81
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Spare tire

82
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Water water

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Couldn't hurt

84
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Do something with it

85
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
You know what even better than that for drinking

86
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,479
Absolutely

87
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,623
We're going to start today on February 5th

88
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
Tried to trademark a name about Road

89
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
I'm certain it's a

90
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Nice old song

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
At some point

92
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Anyway we start here on this

93
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
17th and Alex

94
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Geopolitics

95
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
And I brought

96
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
2

97
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
I don't really want to talk

98
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
Deeply about this.

99
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
It is yet another example of fundamental

100
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Alex

101
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
2009

102
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
Launching Terror attacks against

103
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
Sabotage of factories

104
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Itinerary

105
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Along with it all

106
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,903
These probes discard them up against them to have more intense

107
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Iraq

108
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Pocoyo

109
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,983
Alex knows people have a vested interest in trying to rile up a run

110
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Which is interesting

111
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Because that's not quite

112
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
Does think that they're bad

113
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
We've already talked about how the Iran nuclear program was peaceful

114
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,207
Then that

115
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
And then cut his boys start a war with Iran

116
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,935
Want to start a war with Iran parallels

117
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Become even Starker in the next

118
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Eclipse

119
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,823
Really weird how close this is to the present day

120
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Hi

121
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
So far away

122
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Chronologically

123
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
So here I always talked a little bit more about the situation

124
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Is one of the reasons

125
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Like this

126
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
I want the reason

127
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
But unfortunately I'm not able to

128
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
The time travel episode 4

129
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
America

130
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
I just think that there is a data path we're on here

131
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,847
Not quite a prince but he is the prime minister starts working at McDonald's

132
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,919
Turns it into a fascistic apartheid state

133
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
You can reuse a lot of gag

134
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
The first one

135
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,319
Indicative

136
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
There needs to be a journey

137
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Just jumping to the destiny

138
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
False flag attack bottom-line

139
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Brick

140
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
We got a false flag

141
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Is admitting

142
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Hitman sabotage groups front companies

143
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
It's very clear in 2009

144
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Critical

145
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Of the Israeli government

146
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
He's already been

147
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Clear in the past that

148
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
But he is pro-palestinian

149
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,087
He believes in what they're they're up to

150
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Right to assert

151
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,535
Pointing out that they're f****** with a run

152
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Very different than currently

153
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,399
Very different than even I would say a few years after

154
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
What's interesting is that

155
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,103
Pretty much sure they've been pretty much playing by the same playbook for a long time

156
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,735
Trying to search it with Iran Israel isn't

157
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
The problem with the globalist is there against

158
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Love it

159
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
I don't want the end

160
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,967
Play the end of this choose-your-own-adventure book I want to I want to follow the path

161
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
That the book is taking

162
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Through where how does Alex get from

163
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Cuz if we were to go and listen

164
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
We can make assumptions of what

165
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,303
I think I have a pretty good idea and you're so cynical

166
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,191
Repeated listening with assholes

167
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,031
But like there could be something along the way

168
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
Is a is a pivot point

169
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
I would be remiss

170
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
To not have it

171
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Conversation

172
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
So

173
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Exactly exactly

174
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
So I told you this is going

175
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
To become

176
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Much more

177
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Relevant

178
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Present-day as it relates to it wrong

179
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Quick

180
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Here is why

181
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
The most dramatic element of the

182
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
Decapitation

183
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Iran's top operations

184
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Assassination of leaders

185
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Oh where in your country were going to kill your leaders

186
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:26,495
Beyonce

187
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
We're only going up there dams are shooting your police chief

188
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Isn't that weird

189
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Isn't that weird does have an understanding of how things would go if what he thought

190
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Thought was real

191
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
He's

192
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,743
He's putting out a prediction of exactly what's going on right now

193
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Which is

194
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
In staying at this point in time

195
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Because it doesn't make any sense

196
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
But if you're an insane person creating conspiracy theories

197
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
You know exactly how

198
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
People would react

199
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Text to an actual

200
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Firozi

201
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
So he's nailing it on the head

202
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
In this fake world and then unable to see it whenever it's part of the real

203
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Perhaps

204
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
But he's very very aware of it

205
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Too far up

206
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
That's probably more likely

207
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
Probably some dirty rocks up trumps

208
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Dirty a******

209
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
But

210
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,863
Clearly understand

211
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Comes out as like

212
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Blustery

213
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
Rhetoric

214
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
Threats that are being made to him

215
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
And in the present with no trumps

216
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,479
Famous all-caps we're going to f****** Burke you dude

217
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
That only happened because

218
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
Mike Pompeo

219
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
Set that around as being run as they responded

220
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,815
Peace with Arandas the greatest peace is the greatest War which is

221
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
I would say a measure threat

222
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,471
You know even really a threat

223
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
It's more like come on

224
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,127
Let's do this because neither of us want the worst warts

225
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,455
For everybody

226
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Wish we go whatever direction we're going

227
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
It's going to be extreme

228
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
You know like

229
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Jeep or

230
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Towards the end of that Spectrum

231
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Because of

232
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Extreme days

233
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,607
Play movie episode

234
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
Do that

235
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
I think they would be much more

236
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Successful of fidgets

237
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Comes out

238
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
Man is really one of those

239
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,767
Never going to be like

240
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
And then we go away

241
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,191
No not these days

242
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
I don't give a s***

243
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
That would be the response to that

244
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
The exact same

245
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Scenario that played out

246
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Impreza

247
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
2009

248
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
Being gone not in a vacuum

249
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
From nowhere

250
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
Hitting the vale back of violence

251
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,519
Crazy things make sense

252
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
To accept that this

253
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Is the correct crazy

254
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
But when you are crazy

255
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Normal back then

256
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
You understand how crazy

257
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Everything's crazy

258
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,319
If possible the Hannibal Lecter of conspiracy theories

259
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Next clip

260
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
We get a little break from

261
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Iran Israel issues

262
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
We get into a

263
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Caller

264
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Who's crazy

265
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Which is just fun

266
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
But I was just wondering

267
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
If you noticed

268
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
During the inauguration

269
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
We know that

270
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
That they they always announce

271
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
What they're going to do

272
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
And sometimes you do that

273
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Symbolism in doublespeak

274
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Anna when Robert Verde inauguration

275
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,367
They messed up on purpose he was he didn't

276
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
He didn't

277
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Stutter or

278
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
He was very purposeful

279
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
And he was so determined that he actually repeated

280
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
The oath

281
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
The wrong way

282
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
And I went ahead and looked up

283
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
Some of the words in the dictionary to see what

284
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,847
Maybe they were trying to stay and another definition for execute which is when the words it was missed

285
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
I'm placed in the sentence which changes the meaning of it

286
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Execute

287
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
Office of President ultimate the end

288
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
President and it may be that they were announcing it

289
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Obama will be the last president

290
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,975
And you'll bring in the New World Order North American Union and that end the office of the presidency

291
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
Fireworks

292
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
The Bible

293
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,663
The next

294
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
Well done

295
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,575
Good job look at that guy

296
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Because he had some amazing

297
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
I have

298
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Did you know

299
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Exit

300
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Acute has

301
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
More than one meaning

302
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
John John

303
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Of course you do

304
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
You've never even looked at a dictionary

305
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
You think that the word X

306
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Execute in this speech

307
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,591
Only means one thing in the dictionary

308
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
It can be more than one thing

309
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
Give me more than one thing

310
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
And you think it means one thing

311
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
They might think

312
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
You think it means one thing

313
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
You mean the other day

314
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
Doublespeak

315
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
Pour up

316
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Definition

317
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Call Alex's listeners

318
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Alex

319
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Goodbye

320
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,175
Global it that's true

321
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
Do not tell them about your you're

322
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Losers

323
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
Maybe that's why they can never spell it right

324
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,719
Because there's only one definition for that never looked it up in the

325
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Dictionary

326
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
I don't know about

327
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
Possessive

328
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
It's

329
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Execute your office

330
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Sevdah president

331
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
You don't realize

332
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
You are the

333
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,687
He's executing you to find out who are

334
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
Because he is going to kill our

335
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Nope

336
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,575
F****** tell info Warriors about likely

337
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,439
The declension of nouns

338
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,071
About level of language is it going to all

339
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,423
Second study circles around us a grammar sentence

340
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Training for warriors

341
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Is is gone

342
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
No no no

343
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
That is an adverb

344
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
We are looking for the object of the sentence

345
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Not the director

346
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
I gave you the object directly where you at when you say it

347
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Hold up

348
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Did you know

349
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
That the word Direct

350
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Can mean straight

351
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
And it can also mean to control

352
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,127
So you guys are trying to direct my sentences and I don't need this b******* doublespeak

353
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
That's that's all good

354
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
I found this

355
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Text clip

356
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
What I described as a

357
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Overalls

358
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Not all that far out

359
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Version of a discussion

360
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Situation

361
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
GM

362
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
In trouble

363
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
And so

364
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Alex is talking

365
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Sing about that

366
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
That's not important

367
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519
Because why would I imagine that

368
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
What I was listening to episode

369
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
A couple times

370
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,271
I think this might be an embedded Chrysler Commercial

371
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,647
But I'm not positive

372
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Tell me what you think

373
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
Is really weird put the bike down for this cuz

374
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,479
Chrysler Union

375
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,488
I got to say Chrysler's really but not some great cars last 2 years

376
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Too bad you're probably going under

377
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Globalist

378
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632

Great Cars about

00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,680
Does Mike Fiers and not feel like that's not that weird

384
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Cut off in the

385
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
The middle of a sudden

386
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
I drive a

387
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Charger

388
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,944
Great Value there any

389
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
You're going to want to Value Bass

390
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Shop at this point is we're in a recession

391
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
I have to ask you

392
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
Do you think there's any chance

393
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
Commercial

394
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Ivan

395
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
He is just

396
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
They might go out of business

397
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Outside of Chrysler's best interest

398
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
For advertising

399
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Orbitz

400
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
Globalist company

401
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
To be afraid of

402
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Exactly

403
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
Alright

404
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Bad a little bit upfront but the reality is

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Now all these wings are going to go buy Chryslers

406
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Boom

407
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
They're safe

408
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
So you're saying that Alex is very weird

409
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Of the February 17th 2009

410
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
I think it's more like he just really loves cars

411
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:24,416
And he was really bored while by what he was about to talk about just talking about Taco

412
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Overnight 17th

413
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
18th overnight is this

414
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Is it really weird

415
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
I believe on the Eve

416
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
The 17th

417
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
He does coasttocoastam

418
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
He's working all day trying to

419
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Finish the Obama

420
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Deception does the show that's on it midnight

421
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah he's f***** up

422
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Later

423
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
He's just like

424
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
I would not be surprised if he's running on no fee

425
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Yeah he doesn't even have super male vitality

426
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
Who's them up made by Joel Wallach

427
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
Veterinarian put on some of them.

428
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Hoping for the best

429
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
A little bit

430
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,104
I think Diamond gusset might've stopped

431
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Just survival

432
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Yeah those were those were the days

433
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Haven't heard

434
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Sing from Marty Shack

435
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
All of those restrictions

436
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
He's writing them on his own

437
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
He's writing limericks that it turned out are exactly straight leg by accident 20 years ago

438
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,272
Like I forgot

439
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
He's reading them street over like Milton berle's dirt

440
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
In this episode

441
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Me

442
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Sofa

443
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Mark

444
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Excitement

445
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
Episode

446
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Caller calls in

447
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,200
And wants to talk about how they're a bunch of occult people

448
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Running the world

449
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
World leaders are deeply into the occult and they are Satanist

450
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Does he

451
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
Think he is coming up with an original idea for this show

452
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
But not like real ones

453
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,728
Doctor confrontational with my buddy about this and I need to be reminded

454
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Comes in

455
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336

00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Sofa

457
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
All of it is so wrong

458
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
This is like this is where it's at

459
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Going to be like

460
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576

Mention some of these

467
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Bizarre

468
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,776
The Antics that some of the world leaders like Blair and others that

469
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Have not engaged in

470
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152
Can you cite a couple of those that I put you on the spot

471
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Tony Blair

472
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
Coronavirus

473
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,936
Tony Blair does ritual

474
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,616
My computer is working working working working

475
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Alright

00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
My internet connection is bad

477
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
Bad

478
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,880
Tony Blair's wife got brought out there

479
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
Remembering this s***

480
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
Apologize

481
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Double x

482
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,008
About like a Palestinian suicide bomber

483
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
I believe

484
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
I forget

485
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
Djibouti had to apologize

486
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Because you made a statement that was

487
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Publix

488
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
I think Intel

489
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
We live in a world where Young

490
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
People don't think that blowing

491
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Themselves

492
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Is a good solution

493
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
I don't know what we're talkin

494
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
Something along those lines

495
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
Apologize

496
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
I don't know she's always right

497
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
She's made statements like that they're like that alright

498
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,544
I don't know too much about Terry Blair

499
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,896
I've read all of her autobiography biography

500
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,456
Sure

501
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
She does have a little bit of a spiritualist streak

502
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Okay alright

503
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
Like

504
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Totally

505
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,256
Making things up here

506
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
MX Player

507
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Cherie Blair has a couple of friends

508
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
The mother and daughter pair name

509
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
Sylvia and Carole King

510
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,176
Carol Kaplan was a woman who was a style guide or style advisor

511
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224

Okay

517
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
Feel like if your style guide you have to also believe that you can

518
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Can speak to the other one

519
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,960

00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
There's with the other side

522
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
There's some credible

523
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Citations and evidence

524
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
They might have talked about ghosts

525
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
But I don't really care

526
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
I mean everybody talked about

527
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608

That's not

531
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,064
You used enough sooner or later you're going to find crystals

532
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
The artistic world is like we're really desperate the world stock right now

Suspect in all other countries

564
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Foster worked his way in

Bristol

572
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
This was a scam

573
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Because they got a

574
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
Weirdly

575
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Cheap couple of flats

576
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,752
And it was all worked out through this

577
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,408
Property in London

00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
20 years

580
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
The history of fraud

581
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
Problem

582
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
Sprite soy

583
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,888
For the public

584
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Aspect of it

585
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Geta publicity

586
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
He was much

587
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Closer friends

588
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,592
To the Blairs

589
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,968
Investigation

590
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
Because he was dating their style advisor

591
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Things like go to their house

592
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
For Christmas

593
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Use that as a way to be like

594
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
They had me over for Christmas

595
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,536
As opposed to I went with my girlfriend who was their style advisor

596
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
Know why he's been so successful

597
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Strongly unsuccessful

598
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
BrightStar Samantha of course why wouldn't you

599
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,944
S*** crazy that was his first car

600
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
Comment from her that was like

601
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
I would never fall for him ever again

602
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:02,720
But I was in my early twenties

603
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Sky

604
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
This is life

605
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
So the issue here is not with any kind of

606
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,680
Cherie Blair in front of us

607
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Is a bunch of really golub

608
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
Carol Kaplan fell under Peter Foster

609
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Becoming pregnant

610
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
And the players except it is very clearly

611
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Real estate

612
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
The reason

613
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
You're falling for this guy

614
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,504
What was in the character

615
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:32,672
The real conversation about this situation

616
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,280
Further

617
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
These people suck

618
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,632
That would be a valid

619
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Because

620
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
Need to really be outraged by

621
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
It only makes

622
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Mother really is communicating with

623
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
Stop if your biggest issue

624
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
His biggest issue was

625
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,368
How come I don't get to communicate with the spirit

626
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
If he doesn't believe

627
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
And talk to the spirit

628
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't doesn't matter if he believes it

629
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
No that doesn't matter

630
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:27,200
There are world leaders

631
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,392
I was a fan of the labor bear

632
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
A few times

633
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,496
Aspects of the spiritualism

634
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
2001

635
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Turn on vacation in Mexico

636
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Meet each other with melons in

637
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Papaya

638
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Primal screaming

639
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Rebirth ceremony

640
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
But

641
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,016
Why are world leaders that dump

642
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,720
Ultra Primal scream therapy

643
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Also they consulted

644
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,096
The feng shui expert about ten Downing Street and about Civic plant

645
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
It's all really super benign stuff

646
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
It might be a waste

647
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
The time that argument but otherwise super benign

648
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
I'm the only ultimate

649
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Policy results

650
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Has had

651
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Quote

652
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
The government announced that for the first time since the creation of the NHL

653
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Conventional treatment

654
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
Despite the absence

655
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
Evidence that they might cure the sick

656
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
This quote is thought to have been influenced

657
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,912
Play sherry Blair's interest in alternative Therapies

658
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,984
Alex theoretically is able to sell his pills much

659
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
Easier in the UK because of

660
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
World leaders so dumb

661
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
This always very fast

662
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm most of it most of the information

663
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
That is out there

664
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
You're not true or gossip

665
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Or

666
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Embellish

667
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
So now Alex

668
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,280
102 break while his computer boot boot

669
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Booted up

670
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
He comes back from break

671
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
About Tony Blair

672
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
You tell that one guy to Google

673
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Great

674
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
Well we have our Board of differin

675
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
We are having a board of similarities

676
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
One of the other ones is not understand

677
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
Just because you typing Tony Blair a cult and like

678
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
100000 results

679
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
That does not mean there's 100,000.

680
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
Google found

681
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Stability

682
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
But if you get to pay

683
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Completely different

684
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
You have maybe

685
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Six articles

686
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
About this

687
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
Blog

688
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,872
Every morning is possessed by the spirit

689
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
So he has epilepsy

690
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
So

691
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,368
Did Tony Blair have epilepsy is that what you just revealed

692
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Maybe they

693
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
But I think more likely

694
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
We're dealing with bulshit

695
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
The only reference I can find

696
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
This story about the light

697
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
Yeah I'm very interested in this.

698
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,752
This is on a 2007 block

699
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Claims of the time

700
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Times of London was

701
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
Reporting to Tony Blair sought the advice of

702
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Of the spirit

703
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,432
The block boys from Bohemia claims

Clashes with Gordon Brown

707
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
He sought the advice from Kappa

708
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Style

709
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Hidden Force called

710
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
The light

711
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Foster said

712
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,096
Tony and Carol would say I'll ask mum

713
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
To channel on this

714
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
You hear that at the

715
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Fosters

716
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Said

717
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
This is all information coming from

718
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Peter Falk

719
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Where you at

720
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
All of this information comes from him

721
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
Mirror the Blair's after

722
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
I mean this is sad unfortunately

723
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Carol Kaplan

724
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,488
The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage

725
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Sonic

726
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Fair

727
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Trying to save

728
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
Are you having an affair with

729
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Smear campaign

730
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Another one

731
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
Yeah

732
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
So

733
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
The London Times article that Alex

734
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Blogger site

00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
Builddirect

736
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
And there's a reason

737
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Because the title

738
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Quote

739
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,520

00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,152
Foster Kiki Eminem

741
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
The article begins

742
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
The Australian

743
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
At the center of the

744
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,600
The fair has made a series of claims about the Prime Minister as he tries to

745
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Promote a book

746
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Covering his relations

747
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
The Blairs

748
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
Foster who is called himself the human headline

749
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
Has produced no evidence

750
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
All of this comes from another con man

751
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
Peter Foster

752
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,704
Trying to make a bigger name for himself the bigger story

753
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Alex knows that

754
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
Have you ever looked into any of the sources

755
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,384
He's gone down to the Google

756
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Locust

757
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
If you read the boys from Boca

758
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Give me a Blog

759
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:26,880
Or something like that it comes from times of London

760
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
He doesn't know who Peter Faust

761
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
Cuz he doesn't know that

762
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Look into it

763
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
You can just assume like all my God it says times of London

764
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
He acts like his listen

765
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Extra

766
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
I think that's possible

767
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
If you never learn anything you're always right

768
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Answer the charge

769
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248

I'm going to give that

You know

774
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,328
You're embellishing off something that's benign and actually real but

775
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
The other stuff

776
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
Relying

00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Is there a new style drivers in the story

789
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527

00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
Night are they outlawed

791
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Okay

792
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
What we learned about

793
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
How did

794
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Hideousness

795
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,935
Spiritual satanism

796
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727

Ritual

806
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
I imagine that was just an open

807
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
Opening ceremony or something like that

808
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559

What to do

818
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
President

819
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,951
I need a little more information

820
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Before we go

821
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
Howling at the moon

822
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,799
Ozzy Osbourne Bark at the Moon

823
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
True

824
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,295
Pyramid 666

825
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,183
The presidency before.

826
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Jacques Chirac

827
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Okay

828
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
So

829
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Are there 600

830
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
That's what most of Alex's

831
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Is claims come back

832
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,495
Singer that's an omage to the Great

833
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,311
Right besides mr. Francois made around

834
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Just because meet around with present

835
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
And he

836
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,503
The pyramid was part of his projects

837
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Initiative

838
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Create a bunch of modern

839
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,207
Someone to upgrade the city

840
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,023
Being more of like a lot of people didn't like it

841
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Fair enough

842
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Pyramid does not match

843
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
Feel-Rite

844
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
This giant

845
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,335
American architects

846
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,383
Official schematics

847
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
As well as seven

848
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,319
David shugart guy who wrote books

849
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,879
Country code is real number

850
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,695
Counting six

851
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,303
Pieces of glass

852
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,447
Wait so the real number is 673 and he came away with 689

853
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
Official

854
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
50

855
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,687
This even a picture of the pyramid

856
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
You can just count them

857
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,415
So you

858
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Unless there's like him

859
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
There's like some

860
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:28,351
It would have to be somewhere combined cuz all the numbers are over

861
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
They'll never find these last

862
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
You can see through

863
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,359
Number is based on a mistake was made in the tourism brochures

864
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,175
Constructive claimed that the number of glass panes

865
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,015
Unfortunately the brochure also claimed that the number of eye pain

866
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,367
672 at another point so it's really all over the place who really know

867
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:55,743
The reason that Alex knows about this was drunk one morning

868
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
It's not because of Miss

869
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Printed brochures

870
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
Or because Francois meet around is a well-known Satan

871
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Not

872
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Because of the

873
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
G-Code

874
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
On page 21

875
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
Fiction novel

876
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,335
Robert Langdon the Tom Hanks role says to himself quote this pyramid

877
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Francois

878
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Listen to man

879
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Constructed with exact

00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687

881
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Sick Pains of glass

882
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
A bizarre request that it always been a really hot topic

883
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Among conspiracy bops

884
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
To claim 666

885
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
The number of Satan

886
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,415
This comes from The DaVinci Code

887
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
So why not

888
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Probably

889
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
Cages cages

890
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,799
Top 10 rule

891
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Aaron apology

892
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,503
That time it was explained that movie where the kids end up on another planet

893
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,903
I apologize about that

894
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
I really don't take this

895
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:04,351
Correction from that one

896
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,959
Francois M on because he was the first socialist president of France

897
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Quite strongly to the left

898
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,847
The made the left of legitimate workable political

899
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
He pushed for the abolition of

900
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
The death penalty

901
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
39 Hour Work Week

902
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
He welcomed

903
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
Who is cabinet with

904
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
Super taboo at the time

905
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
Ushered in a very serious rise in popularity

906
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
French Socialist Party

907
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
Almost directly

908
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Expensive Communist Party

909
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
Tommy's party numbers one way down socialist

910
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
The group French president after him

911
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,775
Jacques Chirac was found guilty in 2011 of diverting public funds

912
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
In public

913
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,199
2018 just very recently Nicolas Sarkozy was charged with bribery and accepting it

914
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,015
Stemming from allegations that moammar Kadafi

915
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
Euros for his campaign

916
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
In exchange for access

917
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Savers

918
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,183
Gaddafi's son Saif al-islam Gaddafi

919
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,583
We funded it we have all the details and are ready to reveal everything the first thing we want is this

920
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,935
The first thing we want this clown to do is give the money back to the Libyan people

921
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
He was given a system

922
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
So he could help them

923
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
But he's disappointed us

924
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Give us our money back

925
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,103
After that Fran selected another socialist

926
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Francois

927
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,759
Or is he really that much

928
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,111
You got for president or socialist

929
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
2

930
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Not in prison

931
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
Two aren't

932
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
Amanda

933
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Or whatever

934
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,191
You get a 50 million euro loan gift

935
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
From the Gaddafi

936
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
And you don't

937
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
Stop and think I wonder if they have receipts on this I wonder if they're going to Blackmail

938
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
Take me to Marley even taking into account the other f*****-up

939
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Sarkozy

940
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,207
Not entered history yet

941
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,047
It's coming when when they get there we'll put them in the box

942
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,095
He said a lot of really horrible stuff difficult

943
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Did you know that

944
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Well

945
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,311
Microphones are always usually held above

946
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Where his

947
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
That would be so he never knows if he's

948
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,223
Ice Wars I searched prison

949
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,039
Planet internet high and low

950
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
Trying to find evidence

951
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
M on

952
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Screen with the Moon

953
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
How old is the moon

954
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
Francois M on

955
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Moon

956
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
Anyting

957
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
I also don't care if you yelled at the moon it's

958
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
You're so big

959
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:08,159
Lumiere's the sun right

960
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
French

961
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
So here's another question I have four

962
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:26,591
What is his name also equivalent to his eventual transformed

963
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
State

964
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
Play his name is Lumiere and it gets turned into a candle

965
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,783
Names

966
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
I can't imagine his

967
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:44,255
Given name is Luka

968
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,071
Go through all the names

969
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
Disney movie Beauty and the Beast

970
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Presaged

971
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,471
And predicted the error that we're living in now

972
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Alright

973
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
What is

974
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
The witch

975
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
But not

976
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Asking our help

977
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Immigrants

978
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
What are we

979
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,039
This makes perfect sense

980
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
That is why Trump is elected

981
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
Beauty and the Beast

982
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
Is the greatest

983
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Most

984
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,767
And I don't know where it came from

985
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,607
Must have been an original story that was written in the 90s board

986
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
I assume that's correct

987
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,727
Lumiere was translate from French as light

988
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
Is a man who is

989
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,335
Candelabra

990
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Lumiere

991
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,183
But you don't know if his his name isn't

992
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,231
Clock in French

993
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,047
Play the only one that makes sense for me

994
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Because he was waiting

995
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Was Chip

996
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Born

997
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Oh no

998
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
As a teacup

999
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,239
Oh no

1000
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
To have been alive at that time

1001
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
So we got Miss pops

1002
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Yeah

1003
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,663
She was the

1004
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:10,271
Fred Berry

1005
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,951
Alright

1006
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
I unfortunately don't know any German

1007
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
So I can't

1008
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,775
I can't really hot dog on this one

1009
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
It's also

1010
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Do

1011
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Yep

1012
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Germany to

1013
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:48,159
German Chancellor and Powers

1014
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
Retrospect

1015
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Before he was a German

1016
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,079
German Chancellor

1017
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
Ritualistic

1018
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
Okay great that's

1019
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,095
That's very helpful

1020
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,959
Alright

1021
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
He plays

1022
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Crazy

1023
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
Study robot helmets

1024
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:01,119
Probably does not mean helmet

1025
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,935
I know that Schmidt

1026
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727
Is it very common name

1027
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,543
His name is Helmut Schmidt

1028
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
That is what I know about how much

1029
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
Looks like you know a little more

1030
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
I don't know

1031
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,271
So how much was the Federal Republic of Germany from

1032
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
74 + 90

1033
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,159
Those dates are confusing the Federal Republic of Germany

1034
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Cuz that was before the Berlin Wall was a member of the social

1035
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,423
Craddock party socialist

1036
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Which

1037
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Socialist also like it in Australia that the Democratic Party

1038
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:54,367
Never trust it whenever somebody coops the name social is Social Democratic

1039
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,463
Super. There's no connect

1040
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
Because

1041
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,535
Hitler outlawed the Social Democratic

1042
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
1833

1043
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
And exile

1044
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
How their party

1045
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Granted

1046
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
Although he was throwing up or having a

1047
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
So what kind of axe

1048
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,199
It's a roller coaster there I don't know

1049
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,831
Where we at

1050
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Well

1051
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,767
A big part of my support

1052
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
For politician

1053
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:38,399
My research did not dig up any of that but I can read about him

1054
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
You seem like kind of a

1055
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,287
A decent guy well-meaning dude special

1056
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,359
It's really hard to say what you would have done

1057
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
World War II

1058
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
We're brought up

1059
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
Nazi Germany

1060
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,087
No I think it's pretty easy now we know exactly what people were doing a Nazi Germany right now

1061
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Vulture

1062
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Sure I guess

1063
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
History is kind of hard to

1064
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,743
The square with music

1065
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,327
Cuz he did fight for Nazi Germany in World War II

1066
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
I really don't have any interest

1067
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
Defending him that's early for that

1068
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,447
Attack on those

1069
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
For sure

1070
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
Dance on those things

1071
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
We could do it

1072
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
But none of the stuff

1073
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Relativity

1074
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
History that we would deem

1075
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Problematic

1076
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,503
None of that really matches up with any of Alex's

1077
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
He's he's trying to

1078
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Albert Schmitt

1079
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,951
Connection with Bohemian Grove you'll inevitably turn up the washing

1080
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
Houston Post article from

1081
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Clearly list

1082
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,559
Business

1083
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
Political figures

1084
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,655
Congregate there long before Alex

1085
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Exposed

1086
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
Further it offers

1087
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Pretty upfront

1088
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
Today's Grove

1089
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Schedule accordingly

1090
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:55,199
Included the lake

1091
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
They're followed by Kissinger

1092
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
An organ concert

1093
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Performance

1094
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
Saturday offers

1095
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,391
Shooting hike to the river a band concert

1096
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,999
Review in which

1097
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
It's in the washer

1098
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
The post in 1980

1099
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:20,799
Me too I don't like how our world leaders go to summer Fantasy Camp so I'm not a fan of that it's

1100
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,383
Not like no it's not bad but it's not like

1101
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
Sinister

1102
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:31,551
And then later on have a weird gay orgy that they're not allowed

1103
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
The health of

1104
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
The world

1105
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
It's not the actual activities

1106
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,559
Secrecy

1107
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
For the most part

1108
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
If not just alike

1109
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
Call Jon Ronson

1110
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
Describes it

1111
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
Adult

1112
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
I'm kind of laughable

1113
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
People with.

1114
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Whatever

1115
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,063
From Alex over and go back to

1116
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
About Tony Blair

1117
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,135
If you had read the article and actually

1118
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
It's titled

1119
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
Con man

1120
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Attacks

1121
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
Prime minister

1122
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
It takes away a lot of

1123
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Is cachet

1124
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
So he takes

1125
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,399
Is blurb from that article

1126
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
And pretends that it says

1127
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,775
Bohemian Grove you take this Colonel of weirdness

1128
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
It arouses

1129
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
Takes it out of

1130
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
So

1131
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,967
When Alex does the stuff about the Grove

1132
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
Recent stuff about helmet

1133
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Talk about the Groves

1134
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
Schmidt's

1135
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
He's talking about

1136
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Is literally quoting for

1137
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
Script from his movie The Dark speaker

1138
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
Some like primary source or l

1139
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
He's quoting his own documentary

1140
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,215
I didn't have the time or the money

1141
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Order

1142
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
His book

1143
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,823
For this episode

1144
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,871
But I did find some people who had

1145
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,735
Say is that

1146
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Even grow

1147
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,039
But the reason given is

1148
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,599
It's not because they do the rituals great there

1149
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
Because the Curious Behavior

1150
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
People like they're wearing polka.

1151
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Instead of suits

1152
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
And stuff like that they're weird

1153
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:20,863
Not that's not in line with how West Germans are having fun in the 80s

1154
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,215
German sense of humor

1155
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
Crazy

1156
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:34,175
Clearly also makes

1157
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
Appointment

1158
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,343
It's like that which is very

1159
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,439
He probably did Howl at the Moon though if he was going to

1160
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Also another thing

1161
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,143
That I sound guy who's talking about it says

1162
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,239
Doing rituals positive about that

1163
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,031
Like I said I haven't read the

1164
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
I would posit

1165
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
In the stand-ups

1166
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
People

1167
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
We're kind of more blowhard

1168
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
Do refer to going to open mics as a ritual

1169
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,367
That sucks

1170
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
But you can

1171
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
I'm sure you've heard people

1172
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Not necessarily that's supposed to

1173
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Example but you talked about like

1174
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
Going out for a night of drinking

1175
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
Doing the old ritual

1176
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
Or having a shot

1177
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,679
Is the old ritual

1178
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Ritual that isn't like

1179
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,519
Satanic ritual

1180
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,311
Ritualistic

1181
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
And so the idea of him being like

1182
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
Describe it as a ritual

1183
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Vacation

1184
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,159
Shrek are also in the Washington Post article

1185
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,487
Just about how helmets made like the

1186
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
What is it

1187
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,911
You talked about in that article is that

1188
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
He doesn't want

1189
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
To go to places

1190
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Politicking

1191
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
And so that's

1192
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
The original

1193
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
Union Grove Water

1194
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,199
There right there

1195
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
I was just artist

1196
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
Was

1197
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Spiders come not here

1198
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:21,439
Outside

1199
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Exactly

1200
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,279
No lady

1201
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,631
No report

1202
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:35,519
Circle the first swing

1203
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,823
No snitch

1204
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,175
I mean all this stuff to me is

1205
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
Is just like you chosen

1206
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
Great like

1207
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,991
Kernels of something

1208
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
You can build fear off

1209
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
But

1210
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,135
Closer analysis up that like I would much rather Alex talk about the fact that

1211
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,183
How much was a Nazi

1212
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,023
In World War II

1213
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
Career-wise

1214
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
Why was he you know why did he not have any Nazi

1215
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,215
Nations

1216
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Have a very

1217
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,799
Documented history within the Nazi

1218
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Being

1219
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Not

1220
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
Totally on board

1221
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Same thing with Francois

1222
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
Like if you wanted to talk about

1223
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,039
Francois mitterrand

1224
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Part of the

1225
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
Vichy government for a little while

1226
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
He could do that

1227
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
But if you talked about that

1228
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
To talk about how

1229
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
That was only

1230
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,487
Only for a little while

1231
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,815
Eow

1232
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,583
He was part of the

1233
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,887
Vichy government and then became a rebel against the

1234
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,935
Right right

1235
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,775
And he can't do that

1236
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
Exactly

1237
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
He was a good host

1238
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
She was a good show because

1239
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
Deep dive probably into like the politics

1240
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,719
M on

1241
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:08,447
The party

1242
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,007
Could you because

1243
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
Would you think in like historically you know

1244
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
Like 100 years from now if we still are capable of writing

1245
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:25,855
Do you think people who fought in the American Army would be considered just as evil as people

1246
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,999
Like what it what is the war on Iraq but concentrated

1247
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,399
How many civilians in Iraq

1248
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
Battalion

1249
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,031
Coastal what like 30 million 300 million

1250
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
I don't know how you have that conversation

1251
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
Imagine what the

1252
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,919
Even though we're far away enough

1253
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
Beginning of the Iraq War

1254
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
Contact

1255
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,343
I don't know I still think you are on the side of

1256
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,159
I think you are on the side of xylene

1257
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
Camp stores being listed

1258
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Partial

1259
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Because

1260
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Hey this is true

1261
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
Trump

1262
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,095
Call time

1263
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,399
The people who are enlisted are people who

1264
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
No choice

1265
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Not because they're

1266
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
Economic circumstance

1267
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
The promise of free

1268
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Free college

1269
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
People to join up

1270
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
And then when they're in you sign

1271
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Contract

1272
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Ann if you're in country

1273
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,343
Situation

1274
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
You might die if

1275
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
You don't kill people

1276
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Wrong way

1277
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Right you know right

1278
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
So I think

1279
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,767
To err on the side of not being

1280
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Fully understand

1281
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
Intel

1282
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
Like

1283
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,215
Officers

1284
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,263
Tea Party

1285
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
F****** new bat

1286
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,871
Can make that claim

1287
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:56,479
There is a certain amount of the enlisted man is the gun

1288
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Not the guy Spiro

1289
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
The guy firing

1290
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:08,255
F****** chimney or whomever you want to go with you know she is

1291
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
There are some

1292
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,559
Of your metaphorical

1293
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,911
Likes to go absolutely we're on the side

1294
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Trust

1295
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,983
Faith

1296
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
The individual is

1297
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
Again until there's a

1298
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
You didn't

1299
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
End up like

1300
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
Bignotti later in life

1301
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Is Nazi ideology

1302
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,463
It just happened a progressive politician

1303
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
Secret

1304
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:48,959
I'm going to benefit them through policy action to make sure everybody has Healthcare

1305
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
So weird

1306
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,543
I'm going to become Chancellor of West Germany

1307
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
Running

1308
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
For a party

1309
01:06:56,127 --> 01:07:00,735
That was outlawed by Hitler killed

1310
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,463
Alex's stupid spiritualist stuff

1311
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Chunk

1312
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
Looking up that stuff

1313
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,775
Tell you how crazy

1314
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Like he plays

1315
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
Bark at the Moon

1316
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
After this caller right

1317
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,687
Did he play

1318
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:35,551
Play Baka

1319
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,087
It plays like a minute

1320
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,135
And then it just abruptly ghost

1321
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,071
Commercial like Alex doesn't even

1322
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,911
Commercial

1323
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
And then

1324
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Back

1325
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,335
A commercial commercial is playing in the background like

1326
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
They cut to commercial

1327
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
But

1328
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Alex's broadcast

1329
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,015
They were playing at the whole time

1330
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,807
They broadcast

1331
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
The commercial

1332
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
After the commercials

1333
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
They come back

1334
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:15,743
With Bark at the Moon

1335
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,583
It's a really hoping that it was just playing the whole time

1336
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
Start sit

1337
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Can we come back from

1338
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,807
Counterfeit

1339
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,623
And a fraud

1340
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:46,719
Nearest Target

1341
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,303
What's baptism

1342
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,191
Well I'll tell you right now

1343
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
It's not a ritual

1344
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
Ritual

1345
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
What is the ritual

1346
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:07,711
What is an emoji use my word I don't understand what you say

1347
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,759
It is a literal

1348
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
No greater meaning

1349
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
It's definitely not a ritual

1350
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,583
Rituals in the Christian faith

1351
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:28,191
I'll tell you right now well it's whatever

1352
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,519
We think that once you know what it's not even wine anymore so I can grapes

1353
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
Blood

1354
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Okay

1355
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,479
That's why I don't believe in transubstantiation

1356
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Now let's move along

1357
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
To something else

1358
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Alex

1359
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
Is now going to

1360
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
To jump

1361
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Prediction

1362
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,695
About the dire economic

1363
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Straight

1364
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Some dire strait

1365
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
Show many layers of society show

1366
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:09,663
Let's get focused

1367
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
And worse and worse

1368
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
Bringing a hardcore purse

1369
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Okay

1370
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,935
Get your head screwed on in the right direction

1371
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Okay

1372
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,495
Alright

1373
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:38,335
Prediction about the financial situation as we know now

1374
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
From being in

1375
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,383
In the present

1376
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,687
Stupid

1377
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,711
Slightly

1378
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
She's a trying to sell gold

1379
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,855
Are also really terrible

1380
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:57,023
Congress approval rating

1381
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,327
It's a branding bait-and-switch

1382
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
Very cruel

1383
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
That's not great

1384
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,591
I don't like the sound

1385
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:16,991
The only reason people like that President cuz he's black

1386
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:20,319
Like hanging out against Obamacare

1387
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,111
Things like that

1388
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,695
You said things are good like outside

1389
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
Because the color of his skin

1390
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:31,327
Everything that Obama did

1391
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,399
Every other reason the people liked him every other

1392
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,727
I can't think of any other reason cuz all of the

1393
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Projections

1394
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
The people have a pause

1395
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,103
Feelings

1396
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,639
Profound

1397
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
Yeah

1398
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,479
I mean in a certain way

1399
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,551
He is making a perfect strawman argument

1400
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,391
The they say you're racist if you don't like Obama's policy

1401
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Is the best

1402
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,255
Straw man argument that you could possibly make

1403
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,815
Cover

1404
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
59

1405
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,567
People say you're racist

1406
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
For this

1407
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
Muttered under his breath is

1408
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:25,343
Braces for this

1409
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,463
The last one from February 7th

1410
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,999
Continue

1411
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,583
Alex is really stupid

1412
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:46,079
Cyraq

1413
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,479
I don't want that

1414
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,935
Cowardice

1415
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,031
I do

1416
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
Believe that you could beat the military

1417
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
The wrong people

1418
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:26,527
Children

1419
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
I mean

1420
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,159
You have no idea how awful this thing is that I predict

1421
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
They're going to hurt

1422
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
Your children

1423
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,279
You're saying to yourself

1424
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,423
Right this goes back to that Revelation that I had much

1425
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,919
That's exactly what are you saying

1426
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
You getting to his audience

1427
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
It's crazy

1428
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,783
What is an unfortunate

1429
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,063
He thinks we can go

1430
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,111
The military is crazy

1431
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Literally

1432
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:09,791
Strongest fighting force in the history of the world

1433
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Your world

1434
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Anytime

1435
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,679
In a very short. I want to drop in here real quick

1436
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,727
Conversation

1437
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,359
It doesn't make sense

1438
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
Whenever

1439
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,295
Yeah.

1440
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
Mumble

1441
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
But he said there's no reason

1442
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,719
If he really believes the things that he says

1443
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,023
Violence is the answer

1444
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,655
If you believe that abortion is murder only option is

1445
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,215
Again

1446
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
He thinks there.

1447
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Demon

1448
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,103
Do you have a radio show is going to

1449
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
Stop these

1450
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
Demon

1451
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:03,295
Literally have Supernatural powers

1452
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
Well they're not human

1453
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
So they don't

1454
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
The same protection

1455
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:22,239
I don't know if you do that or not that's the only way

1456
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
For sale

1457
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Doesn't f******

1458
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
Like I was really wrestle

1459
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,599
If one believed the things that Alex

1460
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Believes

1461
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,903
Literally there's no reason

1462
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
Your life is worth

1463
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:47,839
Meaningless if there are demons running the world

1464
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
They're about to

1465
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Consolidate

1466
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,751
Tyranny dystopia

1467
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
Terrorist cells

1468
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
Make militias

1469
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
Become

1470
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Super violet

1471
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,455
That's the only like a logical outcome of it

1472
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,039
It's not an information will you can't have an information war against

1473
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,903
General devil does not care if your life

1474
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,767
I mean there's a difference between

1475
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,327
Things that you say you believe in things that you actually do

1476
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,143
Genuinely believe that

1477
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,983
Climate change the world

1478
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:31,871
8 years

1479
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:39,295
Based on that I should be to prepare

1480
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207
Doing that

1481
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Figure

1482
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
To some extent

1483
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:56,191
He's not the same. Getting water or living somewhere

1484
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:01,823
I'm flooding the is because I kill myself

1485
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,383
That's why we don't have food in the home

1486
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,695
I don't particularly live for the

1487
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:23,327
Apocalyptic scenarios I like podcast

1488
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,095
I like

1489
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,143
Indoor plumbing

1490
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,167
So good

1491
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
Sono

1492
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
Held beliefs

1493
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,567
Are rational

1494
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,847
In terms of climate

1495
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
GameStop

1496
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,175
It's further rational to know that any Lash

1497
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,455
Passing out against

1498
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,527
Tell me human is not going to do anything

1499
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
In order to help the goal that you're looking

1500
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,855
Where is

1501
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
In terms of Alex

1502
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,183
With rhetoric that you put forth like

1503
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:56,095
I don't know I mean but like the big new Brzezinski is a monster

1504
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
If you kill him

1505
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
You can't do that anymore

1506
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,959
Rational

1507
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:05,055
Justifications based on Alex's Redwood for violence and the only

1508
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
To be like

1509
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,615
Don't

1510
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
It's because he knows

1511
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,479
And because he knows that he will be arrested

1512
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
Yeah if people do that

1513
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,807
Irene doesn't

1514
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
So we're done with the 70

1515
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
Now has come and gone

1516
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
Yeah 18th

1517
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Comes back

1518
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
With a bold claim

1519
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,399
Absolutely

1520
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,703
Tour playing two truths and a lie

1521
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,127
They took all the money

1522
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,575
Grabbed kenlay and then he had a heart attack

1523
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,903
Before

1524
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
He's not a Paraguay right now

1525
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,351
Spokane lays in Paraguay

1526
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,959
I did not know there's a limerick

1527
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,799
Chipotle in Paraguay

1528
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,919
Delivery cauliflower

1529
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,967
To say he went down there

1530
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,759
He lost all his hair

1531
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,551
And now I hope

1532
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,367
His death

1533
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,207
I hope he ends up on Showdown with Bobby's wife

1534
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
Is a miserable time

1535
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,119
Throwdown with Bobby Flay

1536
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,239
No

1537
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
Fake his death

1538
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
I think that is really

1539
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,335
Because you such a con man

1540
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,639
Unsatisfying

1541
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,967
Didn't cheat. That's sort of like one of these things is like

1542
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,039
You want a better end of the story they had a heart attack right but

1543
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,879
Before going to prison cuz you also wanted to be punished for what he did

1544
01:19:55,135 --> 01:20:01,279
It's just an unsatisfying on ever again but in his other there is a sort of con man as

1545
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,863
As Folk hero

1546
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,887
That last time

1547
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Subway

1548
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Maybe

1549
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
No no

1550
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
You don't know

1551
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,872
The bird that but if you're if you're doing the the conman is folk hero

1552
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:19,968
You got to have that last trick up his sleeve

1553
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,808
What is autopsy refoundry

1554
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,392
Report its condition was bad

1555
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Begin with

1556
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,720
Francois

1557
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
Ended up dying

1558
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,792
Shortly after

1559
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
From a cancer that

1560
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,352
Successfully hid

1561
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,400
He wasn't power cuz he didn't want to

1562
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,704
Course

1563
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Public affairs and

1564
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,800
Stuff like that I think it's really cool I'm at the

1565
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
Very selfless

1566
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,896
Tough to do I don't think you could pull that off now

1567
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176
Probably couldn't

1568
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,248
I'm so no Ken late did not

1569
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,856
And further Alex did not report a year before that Enron

1570
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
Was a narcotic

1571
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Money laundering

1572
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,744
Also they weren't either of those right

1573
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
They were just

1574
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,144
Eva

1575
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
I would be surprised if the old brick-and-mortar there's a big money laundering with some Junior exec who is in Norco

1576
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:25,760
Or they were so incompetent that they were just putting money into laundromat

1577
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:30,880
They were yeah they were one of the more corrupt history of American Business

1578
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,744
B negative

1579
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
And Connie

1580
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,536
But I would be like

1581
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,840
Absolutely

1582
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
So I'll go ahead

1583
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Give him

1584
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
You know what based on nothing

1585
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,288
I'll be like you can say that it's a Narcotics money laundering

1586
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,848
Not Gonna Take It

1587
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:57,248
I will stipulate

1588
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
The year before

1589
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,576
I don't know if Hitler kick dogs

1590
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
But

1591
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,880
Judging by his track record

1592
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,672
I'll let you say he kick dog

1593
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:11,072
Why not

1594
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
The other

1595
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
Argument

1596
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,448
Hat that I'd like to give

1597
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,264
People along with being able to say I reject your premise

1598
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
The other one is

1599
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,432
Move on

1600
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:31,552
I don't want to get into an argument about whether or not a narcotic

1601
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:36,416
Accepted

1602
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:41,792
That's one strike in a many strikeouts

1603
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,608
It's just like a piece of information

1604
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,960
Let's pretend it's true

1605
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,824
Cool

1606
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
I can't do a 7-hour episode about this about the time

1607
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,760
Read along

1608
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,576
So earlier in the last episode

1609
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:08,160
Made a claim about people only like Barack Obama

1610
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Because he is a black

1611
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,256
And I don't think anybody really prestige

1612
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Outside

1613
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,912
Some people thought there's a certain amount of like he came up from

1614
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,448
Community organizer

1615
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,032
There is a fair

1616
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,848
I'm out of outside

1617
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,200
A relative lack of

1618
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Public

1619
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,808
Black color

1620
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:42,208
Years in government president

1621
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,512
But there wasn't really like a long track record of

1622
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,072
Inside outside

1623
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:51,424
Whatever version of

1624
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,472
I don't I don't think the argument

1625
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
Some sort of a rogue

1626
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:59,360
I'm going to come into it

1627
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,944
I think I think that everyone had a pretty

1628
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,784
He's in the system but he's also

1629
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,368
Hey it's early embodying fresher ideas

1630
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:14,208
Bernie Sanders

1631
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,256
Coming at you like an outsider

1632
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
Is it held public office

1633
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,888
Use a consummate Insider

1634
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
Insider the same way

1635
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Right right

1636
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:32,640
Anyone who gives a s*** little bit

1637
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
Stuff about Obama

1638
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
He's right on that one

1639
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,144
So it's sort of a weak argument

1640
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,728
People to stand by their promises to not have any lobbyists around

1641
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:04,640
Probably not going to happen unless you get money out of politics we're getting closer with a lot of these Democratic Socialist

1642
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,456
Dark money

1643
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
That make it so

1644
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
Can't do that because otherwise it'll just

1645
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,416
Next cycle

1646
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
Mammoth amount

1647
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,144
I'm going he's already

1648
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,824
It's you out there

1649
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
Yes you are

1650
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,984
Sure

1651
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,360
Sure

1652
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
You know from Arabia

1653
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,016
Muslim

1654
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
Same thing

1655
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
Shark

1656
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
First ever president

1657
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,488
The one who's from North Africa

1658
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:30,912
Sure what Dad he's talking about

1659
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:37,312
Around a lot of fake that Barack Obama's options for Dad

1660
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,384
Accidentally saying that Obama's dad is his dad

1661
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,992
I don't know what you think

1662
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,320
That's not.

1663
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
His dad

1664
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,464
Part Swedish

1665
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,632
Trump

1666
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,544
He was a member of the Nazi party

1667
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,920
Brilliant

1668
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
I mean I don't

1669
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,832
I don't care to comment on that past just

1670
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,648
The playing of it

1671
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,440
Whenever you get into like

1672
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,464
Percentages of

1673
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
People to score points

1674
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
That usually means

1675
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,560
And I don't

1676
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
I don't

1677
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,400
It's hard for me

1678
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,680
To hear that in listen

1679
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,728
Someone say I'm not being

1680
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,776
You know it's hard for me to

1681
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,056
Hear someone talk about

1682
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
Percentages

1683
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
And be like

1684
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:47,712
Oh yeah you're real chill you're real cool well it's impossible for somebody to say

1685
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:52,576
First Arab president

1686
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,648
Like all Arabs

1687
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
Muslims

1688
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,280
How do you get 23andMe back and you want to tell me

1689
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Images that's not right

1690
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
That's okay

1691
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
But

1692
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,144
Anyone else

1693
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
It's probably going to be suspicious

1694
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
You taking me

1695
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
I've never asked and I don't care

1696
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,896
I don't care about what percentages I just don't care

1697
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,176
Who cares

1698
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
I don't understand caring about it

1699
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
This is not the crazy

1700
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:32,256
This is a guest who seen before

1701
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:41,728
The episode when Spencer

1702
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,264
He showed up before

1703
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,336
He's a guy who is really again

1704
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,104
Immigration

1705
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,432
He's very on Alex

1706
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,248
He's a guy who set up shop down by the border

1707
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,088
Pictures of people crossing the border

1708
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,416
I meant sends them to authorities

1709
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,464
With that information

1710
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,024
A******

1711
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,888
Big old assholes

1712
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,192
Cheese that we talked about

1713
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
Past episodes

1714
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,336
His whole bio

1715
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
No idea

1716
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,664
I think

1717
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
You're the glencer on the other popular

1718
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Take these people

1719
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,624
And you realize that they're nothing without some

1720
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
Someone like Alex

1721
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
Like they are doing their weirdo thing where they

1722
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,512
Like remote-control drones around a train harass

1723
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Refugees

1724
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
But without

1725
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
Alex

1726
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Ebony real Market penetration

1727
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,192
Becomes very clear

1728
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,800
Even if you agree with like

1729
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,872
Illegals are coming

1730
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
You're still give me like the guy who's flying drunk

1731
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,760
He might feel it too much

1732
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,296
So without without

1733
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
Turn off

1734
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:08,512
I-75 people online I got 217

1735
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
You have a popular show

1736
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,912
What that way

1737
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,288
Multiple times from 7

1738
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,568
5200

1739
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
Something like that

1740
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,880
So like 130 people from Alex's show have checked over

1741
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
Presumption

1742
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:39,232
Alex

1743
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:54,592
But that's for guys act like you've been there

1744
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
I gets crazy

1745
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,736
It's revealing

1746
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,576
Because we also

1747
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
Summertime

1748
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,624
Times I've tracked like

1749
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,464
Things he's promoted like GoFundMe isn't he

1750
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
35 bucks

1751
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
9 hours

1752
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,352
He doesn't really have his much

1753
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,400
Galvanize active audience

1754
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,424
80%

1755
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,960
But people Lakeland

1756
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
I have nobody

1757
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,032
Is oec big jump from Alex

1758
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
F***

1759
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Yet

1760
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
3 * 4 at this interview he's like

1761
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,408
You got a big ol you

1762
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,528
And it's not like the normal buttering Alex up and flattering him out very hasty

1763
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:39,136
Genuine excitement almost surprised like

1764
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,928
People who actually do things

1765
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,720
Which I think is almost

1766
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,792
What's the Border

1767
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,864
The only human level it's kind of like

1768
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Schnucks

1769
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:56,032
So he talks about people in my life

1770
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:59,360
So I don't want to talk too much about what

1771
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,688
Character interview mostly about how

1772
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
They're lying about building

1773
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:09,600
Yeah

1774
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
To come up or much more importantly

1775
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,696
We're going Spencer accidentally

1776
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,024
Shows too many cards about what is actual game

1777
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
I can't get arrested

1778
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:25,472
Find a border for over two years and posting our results and challenging the DHHS

1779
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,080
I know the press conference in the National Press Club on January 15th

1780
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,128
Spent almost $10,000

1781
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,712
How many people showed up in the media nobody

1782
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,952
You rented out the Press Club and no one can you

1783
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
Go fuc yourself

1784
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,840
I can't get arrested

1785
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,656
It's because he's trying to get punished

1786
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,288
To validate their victim Stato he's trying to get arrested

1787
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,592
I thought he was trying to get a rest

1788
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,152
Like I thought that's what he meant where it's like

1789
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:08,480
I've been giving out all of this information and they're not

1790
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,504
Actioning on it

1791
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
No

1792
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:16,672
I think he's talking about educating flying around the Border like proving them wrong

1793
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
Whatever

1794
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,024
For his for his activity

1795
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
Sure that makes as much

1796
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,352
The context

1797
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,912
Episode

1798
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,008
Other is Boston Review

1799
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
Big picture

1800
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
Get arrest

1801
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,152
No one will f*** with me

1802
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:42,016
I keep trying to f*** with them in order to get a response out of them to validate my f******

1803
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:47,392
May everyone keeps ignoring me I think that's what he said

1804
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,696
Well

1805
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,768
Does make more sense in the context of him being like

1806
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
200 people are listening to me

1807
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,008
We had that Logan Roberts

1808
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
Temperature

1809
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,824
Who decided to not

1810
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,896
Challenges on deportation

1811
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,176
The idea of being a

1812
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,040
Be attacked or else they have nothing

1813
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,344
Right and I know it I know it

1814
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,464
Things to say like you got proud boys coming out or like you got sacked it

1815
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,792
March and go give him a hug

1816
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
But if everyone did that

1817
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Screwed

1818
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:33,216
I'm not I'm not I don't think you should do that many other ways to screw it up

1819
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,496
That would be far more status

1820
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,824
Reality of the world

1821
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,848
Itself to a point

1822
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
Especially now we're

1823
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,064
Not respond

1824
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
But in a

1825
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
You could just

1826
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
End up being like

1827
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:59,840
Whatever exit like in The Blues Brothers world

1828
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:04,192
Everybody everybody else

1829
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Never just

1830
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:20,064
The problem is people get hurt

1831
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:24,160
Other people get hurt

1832
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:34,144
Camille want to Light My Fire Boston all over again

1833
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
That was fun

1834
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Look

1835
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
I think it is going Spencer is presenting

1836
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,568
Desperate

1837
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
Dafuq so far

1838
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,128
Episode

1839
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,176
Like if that was it

1840
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
I would have

1841
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,040
It's a it's a waste of gas

1842
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Who cares

1843
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
But then they get into this

1844
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Gross

1845
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:01,792
Is there a complete upheaval in Mexico and I wouldn't be surprised if it was being

1846
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
Orchestrated by their

1847
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,192
Millions of people across the border

1848
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,800
Here are going to be in a world of trouble

1849
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
A lot of people

1850
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,480
District on North

1851
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,576
And you got a lot of very vicious people

1852
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,416
Who wouldn't think twice about blowing your head off

1853
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,288
I can't even

1854
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,592
The number of

1855
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
Racist

1856
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,920
Images that were just

1857
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,224
Spelled out there

1858
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
The Mexican consulate

1859
01:36:54,528 --> 01:37:00,416
Give out as many fake IDs if you want you wanted

1860
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,952
I want Steven Dees

1861
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Different names

1862
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,584
It's only two

1863
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:13,216
Unless you have somebody else with a fake ID on them already

1864
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,592
Sir it is not tempted

1865
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
Alright

1866
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,664
That's crazy

1867
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
The level that Alex

1868
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Spreads

1869
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:29,344
Distrust of like all these other countries that are in America

1870
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,392
Their governments are all

1871
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
Kooky backwards land

1872
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,976
As if they are

1873
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,512
Well also

1874
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
What item Mexico and their consulates behave that way there's no way

1875
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
Country right now

1876
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,520
Mexico cities with biggest penis

1877
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
It is not a novel

1878
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,896
It's not like some sweet like

1879
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
I wasn't trying to present

1880
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Mexico is burning

1881
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,992
Basically

1882
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
Not real live in huts

1883
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
What are you talkin about

1884
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
Premier Hut

1885
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:13,376
Make you up 100.

1886
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912
Cross the border

1887
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,984
And then you get all the welfare you want

1888
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,128
Which be documented in a million times

1889
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,688
In the next life is

1890
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,784
Glenn Spencer putting forth like they won't stick to

1891
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
To blow your f***

1892
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,832
I hate

1893
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
It's not just down here

1894
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,136
They're coming north

1895
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:40,512
Again you Midwestern White's getting scared now cuz later it's going to be too late

1896
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,048
There's a vicious people

1897
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:45,120
Blow your head off what bothers me

1898
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,960
Especially that

1899
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,752
He is even if he's staying

1900
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Even if what he's saying is true

1901
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,848
Write the government is orchestrating it

1902
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:57,152
So these people hate living in Mexico

1903
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,712
To admit them leap right

1904
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,760
Like he's causing unrest

1905
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,064
So

1906
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,368
That means the people who are leaving

1907
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,416
Are trying to escape

1908
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,208
From unrest

1909
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,000
And go to a place

1910
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:15,840
They're not trying to cause unrest

1911
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
They're escaping from

1912
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:23,520
You are not getting the people who are trying to murder people you're getting people who are

1913
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:28,128
Walked over and Syrian refugees

1914
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:31,456
They're being murdered they're not running away from their homes

1915
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,760
Because

1916
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:39,392
The running away from their homes because their government is murdering them

1917
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,184
Which

1918
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
Escaping

1919
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,256
From murder is governor

1920
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,280
Are we speaking

1921
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,304
The people who like

1922
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,120
Doing the murdering and all that becomes

1923
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:55,520
Envogue

1924
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,056
Stickman

1925
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,640
Now they're properly illegal criminals

1926
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,176
GoPro

1927
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,784
They don't generally flea why would they come to America

1928
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,976
Such a feeling of their logic

1929
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,768
Ozark Ruth

1930
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,328
Pennywise

1931
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:23,424
People who have nowhere else to

1932
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:27,264
It's like the fish in a barrel of crude oil today

1933
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
Razors

1934
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,408
I hope you do come back I know you're dead

1935
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,456
Don't feel bad about it

1936
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,736
Alex

1937
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:43,648
SpongeBob

1938
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,208
Enviro cops

1939
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,768
Go out

1940
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,608
Brainwashing

1941
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:58,496
You cannot let your children watch TV

1942
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,336
Don't go to school

1943
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
Don't watch TV

1944
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,688
The outside world

1945
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
Just

1946
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,808
Listen to my show

1947
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Super Nintendo games

1948
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,624
And I really like the zombie

1949
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
My neighbors

1950
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
New

1951
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:29,472
Bentley's ExxonMobil

1952
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
Idea of life

1953
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
You can't trust

1954
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,064
Anyone

1955
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,856
Your family they don't respect you

1956
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
The TV

1957
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Is lying to you

1958
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:51,232
If you go to school they're going to take your kids away

1959
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Exactly

1960
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,328
And then they're going to come home to you as like

1961
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,352
Diversity

1962
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,888
Diversity Dan

1963
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
1 meaning

1964
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,336
That's the one truth

1965
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,360
Of the post

1966
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,688
Inclusive world

1967
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
Bald scary clown

1968
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,368
He said before but

1969
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
Properly

1970
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
Blaine at the last

1971
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Time you did

1972
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,400
Martial law

1973
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:36,288
I don't think that's just the thing though it's not because there's always

1974
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,336
People people are always going to be the problem

1975
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,616
That's one population

1976
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,944
I haven't heard you talk too much

1977
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
Really

1978
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,784
I'm covering up population

1979
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,160
They want to kill most of us it's not all of us

1980
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,256
I know that I I

1981
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:11,360
I don't like being

1982
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,432
I just like I kept that

1983
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
My pardon

1984
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
It's always fun when is

1985
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,760
Will rank

1986
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
Idiot

1987
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:23,904
Weird because he just realized that even his listeners don't listen to him

1988
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,000
But this show where you have

1989
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
Just like

1990
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,400
Frustration with the audience assume that they're either like f****** with you or

1991
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,216
Or they're working for the globalist

1992
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:41,824
Non critical thinker is in

1993
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,408
Is this

1994
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
Martial law in Concord

1995
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
It came up

1996
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,088
F****** stupid I don't know

1997
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,672
I looked into it more after the fact because I was as big.

1998
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,488
What I was able to find out

1999
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,656
Martial law does not mean the same thing

2000
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
Is martial law when Alec

2001
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:08,960
Text talks about it

2002
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
He knows that

2003
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,824
It means they let Thurgood Marshall run things for a while

2004
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:20,224
That would be that would be fun.

2005
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
Use a Supreme Court Justice

2006
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,040
Alex knows better

2007
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:27,904
King Sooper irresponsibly whenever the fear of martial law

2008
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,672
Staying

2009
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
Congress is under martial law

2010
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,256
Is

2011
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,048
Huge Lie by omission

2012
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,584
Not explaining what that mean

2013
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,168
So there's a process that happens. So infrequently

2014
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,192
Chris called martial law

2015
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,240
As described by the hill quote

2016
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:48,640
The use of Martial law refers to bypassing the typical procedure that requires the house to wait a day after the rules committee

2017
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,664
Produce as a rule

2018
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Establishing

2019
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,736
Floor debate parameters before voting

2020
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,272
It's often enacted

2021
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,808
There's a congressional break

2022
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,344
Eminent and legislation is

2023
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,392
People don't miss

2024
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,440
It's a very

2025
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
Regular thing that happen

2026
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
Quite a bit

2027
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,536
In September 2015

2028
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,584
In the house is martial law twice

2029
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,608
It's a month

2030
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,144
Attempt to avert a government

2031
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,168
Shutdown over

2032
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,960
In March 27

2033
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,496
Martial law was invoked by the

2034
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
The GOP

2035
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,032
Hoping to just

2036
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
Bouquet rack

2037
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,104
That one was less about vacation

2038
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,152
More about the fact that if they

2039
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
Savannah weather

2040
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:22,944
Didn't have a chance

2041
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,968
Read the legislation

2042
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,992
They'd likely not him

2043
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,784
Improved from where they were initially with

2044
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,320
Two no votes on the Republican

2045
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Inside the Isle

2046
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,624
Martial law is April

2047
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Edger in the

2048
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
The house

2049
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
Name the center

2050
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
That is done

2051
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,512
From time to time for strategic reasons

2052
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,584
It just has the same name as Alex Jones as big as

2053
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,912
I did not know that until I looked into it either

2054
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,984
That's really interesting

2055
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,592
If I were up because Alex

2056
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
Lincoln stays at Congress

2057
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:58,272
Threatened with martial law everyone putting a gun to the Head

2058
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
Ord

2059
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Just sort of like

2060
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,648
Do you know whatever

2061
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Tutorial

2062
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,464
Control

2063
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
People try to be like

2064
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:16,448
Steve this is another situation

2065
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,128
Seems to be all the time to complain about

2066
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,432
Jaguars

2067
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,968
Is

2068
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,504
So I don't I don't

2069
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,880
Use the idea of martial law

2070
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Of course

2071
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
Yeah everybody

2072
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,488
Abusing

2073
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,816
We want to go on vacation but it's Bill's got it

2074
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,912
Martial law in the house

2075
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:50,752
Gotcha it's abusive that Alex is using it as them

2076
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,520
Some sort of

2077
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,544
Buzzword

2078
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,824
On his show

2079
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,128
He needs to explain every time what it means

2080
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
Because

2081
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
Martial law is such a p

2082
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,736
Of the property

2083
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,272
Yeah yeah

2084
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Doctor part of the

2085
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,344
The paranoia the propaganda put out

2086
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,880
He's made multiple documents

2087
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:10,464
He's about martial law being on the street

2088
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,232
Stuff like that

2089
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,512
To the point where any time

2090
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,048
He brings it up on the show

2091
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,376
Code the audience knows what he's talking about from

2092
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:20,448
Police state documentary

2093
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
So

2094
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,776
To me this is one of the most unfair thing

2095
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,312
He eat.

2096
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,616
So abusive to his audio

2097
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
I just dismissed it out of hand because that's

2098
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:35,040
Stupid the idea that Congress was threatened with martial law now that I know it's actually a thing

2099
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,136
Yeah I think

2100
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,416
The first time we went over it

2101
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,440
When he brought it upsets

2102
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,976
Start a car

2103
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:49,376
We were operating off believing like you was talking about

2104
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
Yeah so

2105
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:58,080
Serous are always

2106
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
Just do a layup

2107
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:04,736
Your f****** telescope the Lucifer god dammit

2108
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,552
I guess I understand just that's a good fun

2109
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,832
It is good fun

2110
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,392
But you just got to think for two seconds

2111
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,208
People are going to be stupid about that could guess what

2112
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,488
People are f****** stupid

2113
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
Lancer problem people have that like

2114
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,584
When you don't have ill-will

2115
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,632
And you're just trying to live your life

2116
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,448
It seems unnecessary to

2117
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
WarGames thing

2118
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:30,336
Yeah

2119
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:34,944
Defense against

2120
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:41,344
Crazy at the same time there's no way to plan for irrational actors if you're irrational

2121
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:45,184
It doesn't matter what you do crazy no matter what

2122
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,488
What are the feelings Alex

2123
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
Nice transitions bag

2124
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,328
Is that his listeners

2125
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,352
Are stupid

2126
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,656
That last call

2127
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,216
Start up where he's lashing out

2128
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,496
If that last call

2129
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,032
Reveal something

2130
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
Incredibly

2131
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:13,344
Somebody comes knocking on the door want to talk to Alex Jones don't come to my house

2132
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,392
My family room sleeping

2133
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:20,256
That was upsetting I literally

2134
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:23,328
Dizzy right now

2135
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,888
I work this much

2136
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,424
For several months

2137
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:36,128
I'm working so hard that my vision blur sometimes call me

2138
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,176
You lazy little preacher

2139
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:44,576
I think it needs a nap

2140
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Alex

2141
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,280
He's responding to that caller who's like you never bring up population

2142
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:00,960
I don't mind him yelling at that dude but it's super f***** up that he's like I didn't

2143
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,752
Sleep the night before because I was on Costa

2144
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:07,104
And then I tried to go to bed and so f****** listener showed up at my house

2145
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,152
But that's f***** up

2146
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:13,248
That is really really f***** up

2147
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:17,344
You should know

2148
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,672
Urban legend

2149
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,232
Sasquatch

2150
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
Just go knock on Sasquatch

2151
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:29,888
I mean I get it we drove past it for Studio

2152
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,448
Same sort of like we were going to knock on the door

2153
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,984
But it was that sort of saying like

2154
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,288
Almost Pilgrim AG aspect of like

2155
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:41,408
Let's go get into his face I am a little disappointed we didn't leave a flaming

2156
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,456
No that's true

2157
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,832
It's f***** up it's f***** up your audience would do that

2158
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
It's f***** up that you had to go through that

2159
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,160
Kind of empathize a little bit

2160
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,696
Even if you are the

2161
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,744
Who is created that vibe

2162
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
I still is a human in lye

2163
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,560
Man that's got

2164
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:02,912
Same time

2165
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,448
You know

2166
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,848
He should be driven insane

2167
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:17,504
Buy one single not every time his eyes closed I don't I don't disagree

2168
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,576
But I'm just saying Isaac

2169
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
I looked at

2170
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,648
Great luck

2171
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:29,024
Goes out the window when you remember like on a last 2009 episode

2172
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,048
Respect

2173
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
So like

2174
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,888
Who else do they have to go to

2175
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:39,264
It scares me the idea of like anybody showing up

2176
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
Someone's door just because

2177
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,360
Something to go wrong some misunderstanding

2178
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,896
His wife and kids are they're going to like

2179
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,176
There's just too much

2180
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,712
That

2181
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,784
Really think that's a horror movie

2182
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,344
What he's described

2183
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,160
Someone who likes me knocks on my door

2184
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,184
The f****** horror

2185
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,256
Right right

2186
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,328
Baseline

2187
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,864
That's a good

2188
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,632
Okay

2189
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:08,448
Legally actionable is

2190
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,240
We get a team of paper

2191
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,520
Roughly

2192
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
24

2193
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,568
Everybody

2194
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:14,848
Every hour

2195
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Knox

2196
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,664
Scott Pruitt

2197
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Everybody gets their own hour

2198
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,808
Everybody has to knock like two or three times then they Runaway

2199
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,344
I think it's not terrible plan but

2200
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,136
Because we're talking about it on air it's

2201
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:32,512
The problem is is that illegal

2202
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:37,888
I guess it's like a nuisance but illegal individually for them because of like private property

2203
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:41,216
Probably

2204
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:42,496
Conspiracy harassment

2205
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,824
Okay cuz we're organized

2206
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:52,224
What we should do is go to the next one

2207
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,784
Facebook where Alex Jones

2208
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,064
Brings in

2209
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,112
The arch weirdo

2210
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:02,720
Okay

2211
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,000
About this guy

2212
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:18,592
Now.

2213
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,360
From

2214
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
Top

2215
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:41,376
We've been waiting with bated breath

2216
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,960
Stop

2217
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:51,616
Now there

2218
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,200
Our house

2219
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:08,768
Stafford Lindsey tells me this I start putting feelers out

2220
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
Okay

2221
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
So the gas

2222
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:22,080
Who is the complete weirdo

2223
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,176
There's a

2224
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,736
Prefer

2225
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,272
Who is going to be on

2226
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,040
The show

2227
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,600
I don't like it when you say pastor and they are on it

2228
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:39,232
Let's not going to bode well

2229
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:44,352
So we're getting weird predictions and his stupidity here in a few

2230
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,912
Website

2231
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,728
Is a catalog

2232
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,776
Of people's mineral rights

2233
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,568
Because all that's very public

2234
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,592
Information

2235
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,616
You can find this

2236
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,408
Information David Jones

A number of different oil

01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:07,392
Course David Bowie.

2239
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,928
Okay then

2240
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:11,488
He owns a number of oil

2241
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,256
Claims

2242
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,816
And throughout

2243
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,840
Area

2244
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:20,704
What is that on Zoe's

2245
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,728
Area

2246
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,008
Whenever you have

2247
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,568
You own a claim

2248
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,616

2249
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:29,664
Share those

2250
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
Yeah

2251
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Free People

2252
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832
Clearly is that

2253
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,416
Someone's drinking somebody's

2254
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:42,976
2000

2255
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,512
2009

2256
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:47,584
There's an artificial inflation of oil price

2257
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,376
Right

2258
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,240
Strike in

2259
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
Disgust

2260
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,432
The past fear of things collapsing in the Middle East

2261
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,968
Ulta

2262
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,528
Together exactly the same time

2263
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,808
And led to

2264
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,088
Hyperinflation

2265
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,112
The price of oil

2266
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,904
It lasted throughout

2267
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,464
A bit like almost a year 2000

2268
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,488
And the bottoms

2269
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,560
The beginning

2270
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,328
2000

2271
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,864
The oil holding

2272
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:23,680
Estimated revenue on a monthly basis

2273
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,776
From the

2274
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
Atlanta

2275
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,848
We're 55,000

2276
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,384
$42

2277
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Monthly

2278
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,176
Monthly

2279
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,200
Monthly

2280
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,992
$55,000

2281
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:41,088
Just from the ownership of the oil right now.

2282
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,392
Extracted it all someone else does all that

2283
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:45,952
He just get six hundred grand for free every year

2284
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,488
Yep there's the contract

2285
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:54,656
That's who he's getting it from is from the people who are taking it out yet

2286
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:57,728
Company owner

2287
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:01,312
So now you go a little bit further you get into Where We Are

2288
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
In 2000

2289
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
9

2290
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,872
The end of

2291
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,408
2008

2292
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
You sneeze

2293
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,224
Alex Jones Is Dead

2294
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,552
Probably only worth about ten

2295
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
Thousand

2296
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:16,928
So you go from 55,000 town to around 10,000

2297
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,976
And like as it goes on

2298
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,048
That was a hit

2299
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,096
It comes from the price of oil

2300
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Yeah

2301
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,912
Yeah

2302
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:30,752
Migrated its foul to lower level than it was before

2303
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,032
But they're pretending this

2304
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:35,360
Hundred forty dollars a barrel oil is normal

2305
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:39,712
That's be hyper yeah yeah yeah

2306
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,992
It came down to like

2307
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
3 something

2308
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,552
I meant rebounded to

2309
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:46,368
More normal level

2310
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,416
It before that was a

2311
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
It was only at like

2312
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,560
Did you talk about 6230 that's still

2313
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,608
50% drop yeah

2314
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:59,680
That could be what you want to talk about but instead they use the

2315
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,472
40 hyper number

2316
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,496
From all these pics

2317
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,776
9 months

2318
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,568
It's super inches

2319
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,872
What that discretionary income

2320
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,920
In the Jones family

2321
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,944
Disappeared

2322
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,736
Right around the

2323
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:15,040
Time

2324
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:20,416
Need Monday bring somebody who has a lot of money

2325
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,184
Again.

2326
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,976
I'm only bringing this up

2327
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,256
Because

2328
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,144
Involvement

2329
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,752
Is relevant

2330
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,544
This information that I found

2331
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,360
It's weird I mean like I don't know what

2332
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,968
I do remember

2333
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:44,992
Necessarily but

2334
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:47,808
I think two dudes like

2335
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,600
I don't get I don't like

2336
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:55,232
I don't have a radio Studio that my parents are providing right

2337
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,536
But I do think

2338
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
Zet

2339
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,352
Your family's life would change

2340
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,912
If you lost $40,000 a month

2341
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,216
It just random

2342
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:08,800
I don't think that that's irrelevant at all

2343
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,080
Think that's huge

2344
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,640
Because is that

2345
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,944
I guess dad has his job job

2346
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:19,296
The kid's life job and then just because of the s*** he owned he's getting 55.

2347
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:24,416
I mean at the same time though it was a

2348
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:27,488
One time it was like a massive windfall

2349
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:33,632
That you couldn't really budget so unless they went wild on spending

2350
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:37,216
Entirely possible if you have a half a million dollars that you weren't expect

2351
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,752
Think she'll ride around with Alex

2352
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,056
Studios

2353
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:47,712
But also looking forward very quickly

2354
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,992
If you look at what

2355
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,016
Before is that

2356
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,808
Huge spike in oil prices

2357
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,624
They were still under $20,000 a month

2358
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,952
Like it went up in 2006

2359
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,744
Peak jumped over the toy

2360
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,072
$20,000

2361
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,352
And then it was sort of

2362
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,632
Leveling around

2363
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:08,448
It always leveling around there in the high 10

2364
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
Jump

2365
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,008
South of 20,000

2366
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,080
30000

2367
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
35000

2368
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,896
Extra dollars a month

2369
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,200
So either you

2370
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:23,552
Budget that and plan for it to drop down again which it was

2371
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,344
Have to assume it would

2372
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,184
You go ape crazy and buy yourself a new studio

2373
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,976
Right and I don't know if

2374
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,792
What is necessary

2375
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,072
Become like

2376
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:38,656
Super Thrifty I'm going to live out the rest of my days considering he's now

2377
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:41,984
The HR representative

2378
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,520
New like I think his dad might be

2379
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,800
So much more invested

2380
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:50,176
Sit in the company then anyone is really dealing might be a part of it

2381
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,712
Yeah I don't know

2382
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,992
I don't know

2383
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,272
I think this

2384
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,808
I think it is

2385
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
These accidentally

2386
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Revealed

2387
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,000
Well I looked at up the open

2388
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,280
To look at like

2389
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
Interesting

2390
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:06,816
Interesting

2391
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,608
You for a year

2392
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,656
Giant

2393
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,680
I'm out of money coming

2394
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,728
Your family that wasn't there before

2395
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,264
And then after that

2396
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,800
Your

2397
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,104
Getting into a position where

2398
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,128
Maybe summer

2399
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,408
Of your narrative

2400
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,688
.

2401
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,480
Not saying I'm just saying

2402
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,016
Anyway Lindsey Williams

2403
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,040
Yes

2404
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,064
Music

2405
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,600
He comes in

2406
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:32,416
I think he is I don't know

2407
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:34,464
That this isn't one of those that I decided I was

2408
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,744
Going to like call the back

2409
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,792
Just church and find out

2410
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
Because he's

2411
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,424
I don't know I'm working

2412
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,448
Concerned with him

2413
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Outright

2414
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,800
He's good at one thing

2415
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,080
Flattering

2416
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,896
This is all planted by the elite

2417
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:56,224
Let me assure everyone out there in Alex Jones

2418
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,528
Infowars

2419
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:02,880
Everything you are hearing Alex Jones say is true

2420
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:09,280
Believe every word you hear every day it may sound unbelievable

2421
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:12,608
It's very sad right but

2422
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,912
If you're not talking about info

2423
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:21,312
Believe every single thing every single day

2424
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,872
It's very clear that you could camp

2425
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,152
He knows how to get out of

2426
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,432
Still like not Quest

2427
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:33,088
Lindsey Williams I'm just going to flash this out as best I can cuz I don't

2428
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,368
Do you spell Poseidon

2429
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:38,720
Alaska in 1971

2430
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:42,304
Three years later the transit last trans Alaska pipeline

2431
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,584
I was beginning Construction

2432
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:51,520
Volunteered to be the chaplain of the pipeline

2433
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:57,920
Being a volunteer chaplain executive with the oil company

2434
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:03,552
The world

2435
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:08,672
That's your story

2436
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:09,696
What

2437
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,464
You want to know

2438
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:11,744
What do you question

2439
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,024
Is this

2440
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Standard practice

2441
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:18,400
To bring the chaplain into hey we're f****** over the world

2442
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
I feel like it's a

2443
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,472
I feel like

2444
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,800
I feel like you're either a shity executive you probably like

2445
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:25,824
He's that guy like

2446
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,848
God he's probably

2447
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:29,152
Probably going to have a higher power than money

2448
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:32,224
Let's not bring him into our f****** secret

2449
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,272
Other side of that question

2450
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:37,088
If you are an executive

2451
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,696
Oh I'm scared

2452
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:43,744
Maybe you should join my scam

2453
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,632
And then we'll all together

2454
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:51,680
That to me

2455
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,472
I know your response

2456
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,032
Set storage in Paso

2457
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:56,800
The smell test

2458
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:00,128
Anyway I don't know why

2459
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:08,320
That one makes the most sense at least

2460
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:14,720
Only because the rest of it is such b*******

2461
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
What

2462
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,584
Are you want

2463
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,376
Okay great

2464
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,680
Schneider the chaplain because nobody said

2465
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:27,264
It's not an elected position if you're the volunteer chaplain

2466
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,568
No volunteer chaplain

2467
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:36,480
Executive status that have a man of God in there whenever you're built

2468
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,064
Hour-and-a-half

2469
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,856
DVD that he put out

2470
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,648
He was telling his story

2471
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:45,440
Add swiss cheese baby

2472
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:48,256
There is just holes everywhere like

2473
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,024
Is just

2474
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,304
What what

2475
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,352
Dwight White

2476
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:57,984
Your chaplain they let you into the secret battle believe that number two

2477
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:04,640
74th on and white

2478
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,576
Right do you was doing that

2479
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,624
Continue until present

2480
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,904
So where's your information

2481
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,720
People

2482
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:20,256
In the seventies that let you win

2483
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:24,608
The boardroom possibly have heard about scams

2484
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
That they were doing

2485
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,656
And you didn't tell anybody

2486
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,936
On you

2487
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:34,336
That's unless they left a detailed plan

2488
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:39,200
This point

2489
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,504
From that time

2490
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,320
All the things

2491
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,184
You knew about it ahead of time

2492
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,464
DD's order

2493
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,232
Post

2494
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:56,608
Post facto propaganda

2495
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,936
All this guy's got

2496
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,472
That is all he has

2497
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:02,752
Just talk

2498
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
Think about things

2499
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,312
Have already happened and it like

2500
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,592
Oh yeah something about that

2501
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,664
I do about that Insider source

2502
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
Love it

2503
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:13,760
NSX clip he's going to talk

2504
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:16,832
About the per

2505
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,440
They have planned this thing worldwide

2506
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
In order to

2507
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:26,048
To do what they wish to accomplish now let me tell you what's going to happen in America

2508
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:32,192
Is happening right today

2509
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:35,008
And you taking notes this man said to me

2510
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,592
Person who knows everything 82 years of age

2511
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,712
He said to me after I've been threatened

2512
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:46,528
Go along with what you said

2513
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:52,672
I couldn't even say on Alex Jones Show today

2514
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,072
Keeping Network he said to me he said Lindsey

2515
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:04,448
He said America will see a financial collapse

2516
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:10,336
It will take years to come out of it at that time we didn't have the bank crisis we didn't have a real estate prices

2517
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:14,944
We didn't have the big bailout packages we got right now he told It All To Me ahead of time

2518
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:21,344
Because they had it planned

2519
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:25,440
I wish I could shout it today

2520
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:31,328
Believe everything you are hearing Alex Jones say even if you have trouble believing

2521
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,352
Believe it anyway

2522
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:37,472
That's a man of God right there

2523
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,824
Hey YouTube you don't even if you do even if it doesn't pass the smell test

2524
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,592
Believer

2525
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:43,872
Just believe it

2526
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,688
I know that I know that I know baby

2527
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,712
Just believe it

2528
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:52,576
So he took some notes he's hearing this plan

2529
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,856
In 71

2530
02:07:54,112 --> 02:08:00,256
No showed up in Alaska

2531
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:05,120
Haha

2532
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:09,472
Write okay though it's because of that information

2533
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
Nope

2534
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,776
So you got different information

2535
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:12,800
Eunos

2536
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,592
He knows a guy

2537
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:17,408
He said he's 82 years old some guy was eighty-two years old

2538
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:22,528
He has an inside Elite source

2539
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:23,552
Another

2540
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:29,952
So he claims any of the secret of Insider sources told him about the 2008/2009 crashed that it was going to happen before

2541
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:33,792
Problem with his prediction is the same with all of Alex's

2542
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:35,328
Secateurs all of his death

2543
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:41,728
Just claiming they were told it was going to happen before it did

2544
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,544
The easiest Hong Kong the game

2545
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,896
And only made worse by the fact that almost all of this guy's not

2546
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,712
With predictions like there's going to be trouble in the Middle East

2547
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:54,016
Coronavirus

2548
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,040
Everything else

2549
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:55,808
Watershed

2550
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:59,136
He claimed that the devil's Messiah was supposed to show up in 2012

2551
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:02,976
The dollar was supposed to clap the number of times

2552
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,768
Global Currency Reset

2553
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,096
Then they turned it off and on

2554
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:13,216
Modem predictions about silver and gold prices

2555
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:16,288
She also is pushing it

2556
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:21,664
I'm as well as oil prices every specifically

2557
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,200
But he's talking about

2558
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,480
Because he's got it from the

2559
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:30,368
Insidesource it's fun when they start to believe their own b******* and they make specific birthday

2560
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:34,464
Like my favorite part whenever they reveal how stupid they are

2561
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
Where is

2562
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,512
Oh s***

2563
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,560
I am getting all these things right

2564
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:41,888
Forgetting

2565
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:45,216
Predictions

2566
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:47,520
Because

2567
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:49,056
Based on his narrative

2568
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:49,824
He was

2569
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,104
Yeah with the elite

2570
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:53,152
Oil Company in that s***

2571
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:59,552
In the seventies and then telling him things that are going to happen they should never be wrong

2572
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,112
He's not guessing

2573
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:04,672
You know

2574
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,208
He's not guessing

2575
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,768
It's not really a prediction so much as it is

2576
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:11,328
Revelation whistleblowing

2577
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,096
Yeah

2578
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,912
Whistleblowing is a great Pretender

2579
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,680
He's doing

2580
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,264
So there's there's trouble there

2581
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,032
I mean even

2582
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,896
Executive and then Within Me

2583
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
Crazy

2584
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:32,576
You have this inside the secret to my success

2585
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:36,672
Then the other part I've got this Insider Source was telling me all this stuff that's bull

2586
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:37,696
How old is

2587
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,744
Anybody who's not

2588
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,816
Using him for their own

2589
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:45,376
Gold

2590
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,144
Would be like

2591
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,912
Dude

2592
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:47,936
Stop it

2593
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:48,960
Is crazy

2594
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,520
And this

2595
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,544
I think is

2596
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,592
Hilarious

2597
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:59,456
The average American didn't have the slightest.

2598
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:01,248
Structure

2599
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,296
Off the

2600
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,576
Price of crude oil

2601
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:06,624
147 dollars Barrel 2

2602
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:11,232
3833

2603
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:16,352
It went down from $45 per gallon

2604
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:21,984
$2.50 a gallon in some states

2605
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,848
Write down these two words

2606
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:27,872
Text Rodger

2607
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:28,896
Textra

2608
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,016
Did the thing is like

2609
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:34,784
It's not like

2610
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,808
Gas is been

2611
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:38,112
$140 a barrel for

2612
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:40,928
More than a few months

2613
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,208
It's been months but it's been

2614
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:46,048
It's not like yeah

2615
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
.

2616
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,424
As a result of that

2617
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:55,008
And others have walls

2618
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,032
34

2619
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,080
75% or more

2620
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:02,944
Now that he's pretending that all taxes come from oil

2621
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:03,968
Does not

2622
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,784
Accurate adults

2623
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,552
Oil

2624
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,320
Specifically

2625
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,880
130

2626
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:14,720
That means that the entire Texas

2627
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:17,280
Lost 75% of its

2628
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,816
Which is ludicrous

2629
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:27,008
I was just waiting over

2630
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:29,824
All the money that will be given away in Denver

2631
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,104
They going to

2632
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:34,432
The College of the university in Denver

2633
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:36,224
They're going to improve

2634
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,784
Coming off of the interstate

2635
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:44,160
They going to build a building

2636
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,608
If they gave you say

2637
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,888
10 million-dollar

2638
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:57,984
And you were supposed to build a new ramp off of such-and-such of an interstate with it

2639
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:03,616
Approximately

2640
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,664
60% of 40

2641
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:10,272
Stimulus package they have intentionally

2642
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:15,904
And it's not a single Congress stimulus package

2643
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
Because now

2644
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:19,488
Updates going to be able to

2645
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:25,376
All of these items

2646
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
The other taxes

2647
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:35,104
An argument for why the stimulus package didn't go far enough which is the progressive argument at the time

2648
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,200
I'm so like

2649
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:42,272
You got stimulus check

2650
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:46,112
What you yelling at the GOP

2651
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:46,880
Conservatory

2652
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:50,976
Individual people get stimulus checks

2653
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:52,512
Couple hundred

2654
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:57,376
You know that that's how are they supposed to live for the rest of their lives

2655
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:59,168
My stimulus

2656
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,216
Give a man a fish

2657
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,496
Doesn't cover everything

2658
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:03,520
Play PID

2659
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,800
Get to you're going

2660
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:10,688
That sort of thing is the stimulate its motion

2661
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,968
Push

2662
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:18,112
Where's the red

2663
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:20,160
Google have multiple meanings

2664
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,440
No

2665
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:23,744
It's like the idea of like

2666
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,512
So this

2667
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:25,280
Big

2668
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:27,328
Like load of money

2669
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:29,888
Gabe is going to pay for 60% of

2670
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,240
Regular budget

2671
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:38,848
Next year's taxes all of that makes perfect

2672
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,640
Have you read this bill

2673
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:41,664
Do you know what it does

2674
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
I just looked it up in Denver

2675
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:45,504
It improve their infrastructure

2676
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,808
Which they need

2677
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
And it doesn't

2678
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,648
At a really high percentage

2679
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,952
More people

2680
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:55,488
Are going to be there.

02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,512

2683
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:02,400
Victory evil it's part of their plan than 60%

2684
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,424
Improvement on

2685
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:04,704
Infrastructure issues

2686
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,984
Pretty good math

2687
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,032
So I don't know this is just

2688
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,056
This is ludicrous

2689
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:14,176
Like the idea of presenting the idea that all taxes come from oil

2690
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:16,224
For granted a lot of

2691
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,248
Text Doug

2692
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,528
I hope it's not all of it

2693
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,088
Most sincerely

2694
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,672
The other is the

2695
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:26,976
I mean I like your angle on a

2696
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:27,744
Better than

2697
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,024
The idea of life

2698
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:36,192
You're actually arguing it should have been more of a better attack on it

2699
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:42,336
Snooze is showing all of the policy principles that Alexandria is pushing and they're like

2700
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:44,128
He wants you to have

She wants you to eat

2704

Bulshit

2705
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,088
Things that you should be afraid

2712
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:08,704
Dude

2713
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,472
It's crazy

2714
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:11,520
He's a gas to the racino

2715
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,312
On the show

2716
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,592
Like I said I watch

2717
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:18,432
A bunch of his other stuff I was going to get clips from that but

2718
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,456
Too boring

2719
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,224
It's just

2720
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:20,992
It's nonsense

2721
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:24,064
I really want to drive home is like

2722
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:25,600
He's not saying

2723
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,904
These predictions are all

2724
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,696
Like after the fact

2725
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:32,768
They're just validating his nonsense

2726
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
But the reason

2727
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
Pull it off

2728
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,864
Because he knows the game

2729
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:45,312
The number of times different people that said what you want you please call this man back and get some more latest information I'm going to admit

2730
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,360
Cialix

2731
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,152
So that isn't in reference to

2732
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:50,688
To this source that he has

2733
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:51,968
People keep asking

2734
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:53,504
Him to call him hey

2735
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,528
Find out what

2736
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,552
Alice's up

2737
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,648
Too scared to call that guy back

2738
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,976
You have now made yourself a public Persona that

2739
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:05,280
Dependent on this guy's information

2740
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:07,072
You call that a****** back

2741
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,352
No matter what

2742
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,912
All that assholes

2743
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:15,008
You say you called that ass hold back and you make up whatever it is you want

2744
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:17,568
Call me a****** in the first place

2745
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,848
Spoiler alert

2746
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:23,712
That's what he starts doing a couple years after 2000

2747
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:27,552
I am I'm fighting to even think of what he might tell me

2748
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,600
What do I make of this

2749
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:31,904
The fact that they have accelerated that

2750
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:32,672
Here it is

2751
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,464
Just

2752
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:37,024
Contact Steve the question

2753
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:37,792
Is like

2754
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,632
What do you think about the idea that oil has gone down

2755
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:42,656
So far

2756
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:45,728
Like it's gone down so far so quickly

2757
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:51,360
Alex the reason they had done this in my mind thinking it's because

2758
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,896
They realize

2759
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:54,176
Program Blacula

2760
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:55,712
Alex Jones

2761
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:57,760
So many people

2762
02:17:58,272 --> 02:18:04,416
The American people are beginning to reveal

2763
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:07,488
Washington control

2764
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:17,984
I found that there was only one thing they were afraid of

2765
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:22,592
I didn't bother them they had control of that Congress didn't concern them the president

2766
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:30,272
What is the one thing

2767
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:32,832
They are afraid of the American

2768
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:35,904
Publix the masses of people waking up

2769
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,720
And that's where Alex Jones Show comes in

2770
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:45,120
That's where Infowars comes and that's where infowars.com comes in

2771
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:47,936
Jim more than anything else in this world

2772
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:53,056
When the masses of people wake up they don't have a chance there's a handful of them

2773
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:56,384
I believe Alex

2774
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,664
Reason that they have

2775
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:00,736
Accelerated

Pakistan American worldwide

2778
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:07,136
I'm going below $50 a barrel

2779
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:13,536
The reason I believe they've done it is because so many

2780
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:14,816
Amazing

2781
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
That is

2782
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,120
That's a badass

2783
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:19,168
Licking of the highest order

2784
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,472
Yep

2785
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:24,800
That's a solid move right there a little bit

2786
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,080
She listened to the show

2787
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:30,176
He figured out what talking points were hot right now you Barrel them back

2788
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:32,736
And now Dan I'm going to stay

2789
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,272
He's going to get to the cell

2790
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:40,928
It has like his DVD Empire that he does later

2791
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:43,744
You end up coming back on it for the bun

2792
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,304
Like he gets much more of his own Cottage Inn

2793
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:50,656
Unfollowers go from 100 to 300

2794
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:52,960
Much like a climbing

2795
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:57,312
Never really spells out on the shows at the globalist

2796
02:19:57,568 --> 02:20:01,152
Crashed the oil

2797
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:03,456
They're going to submit Revolution

2798
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,480
All over the world

2799
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:10,880
Noted pushed the price of oil back up to about $200 a barrel.

2800
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:14,208
To reveal the secret oil reserves that they control

2801
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:19,840
They pretended didn't exist until that moment she knows about from back when he was in the 70

2802
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:25,472
Working with these oil Executives as a volunteer chaplain lower the price of oil

2803
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:32,128
No because they get to under $300 a barrel that they have more oil

2804
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
Then that would drive down the price

2805
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:41,344
Cerveza I know shushing is little bit but yeah

2806
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:45,184
Dial scale

2807
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,256
Yep

2808
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:54,656
Got a big problem years ago

2809
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,216
40 years long

2810
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:58,752
Cardinals hat

2811
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:05,152
Bring the price of oil up really high

2812
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:08,480
Normalize the price back down

2813
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:16,928
40 year long

2814
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:27,168
But even Alex's dad is it so bad that even Alex's fan

2815
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:30,752
Keep him

2816
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:33,056

2817
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,336

Berkeley unanimous @prisonplanet

2819
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:38,944
Oil Insider Lindsay Williams is full of s***

2820
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:44,832
The article is about a mini Rebellion that's taking place in the Infowars forums

2821
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:45,600
Text Lindsay William

2823
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:47,136
The outrage

2824
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:48,928
Seems to stem from the fact that William

2825
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:52,512
The pop-up and make appearances on the Alex Jones Show every time there's a world crisis

2826

What affects the price of crude oil

2827
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:59,168
I have two claims I Williams is made about being in danger for his whistleblowing

2828
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,960
Williams claims that he's received

2829
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:02,240
Threats in the past bags

2830
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,264
The obvious question

2831
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:07,616
Why is it keep risking his life every 3 to 4 months to bring up his darling revelation

2832
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:10,944
It's a good question, Sleep Center

2833
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,224
Jones's information

2834
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:15,552
If it's so earth-shattering after all that's what you'd really do be

2835
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,576
Forget your whistleblowers

2836
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:17,600
Information

2837
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:19,136
I'd wanted to remain alive

2838
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,440
Because

2839
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:26,816
Cannot make a goddamn Penny if he's given up his information anonymously dollar

2840
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:29,888
That is so true

2841
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,448
He is trying to save us

2842
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:36,288
Because the only way to stop the globalist

2843
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:38,080
Is that the American people wake up

2844
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:38,848
This is

2845
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:40,384
An altruistic

2846
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:41,408
Effort

2847
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:45,248
Some comments from the Infowars for

2848
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:47,296
Melvin

2849
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:50,880
This is something he's not really do.

2850
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:55,744
Give me some from the info Warriors themselves

2851
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,144
The sharpest tool in the shed but even my granny could recognize Williams for what he is

2852
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,680
A bullshiting opportunist

2853
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:05,216
Alright I like it

2854
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:09,312
There's another one strict and to-the-point there's a clear script in formula

2855
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:10,592
It's not at all improvised

2856
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:13,664
I think many are coming to the conclusion he's just trying to sell DVD

2857
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,248
Another one quote

2858
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:18,272
For the past eight years.

2859
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:23,392
Sadly today I just can't stand listening to this kind of bulshit Lindsey Williams

2860
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:26,976
Lindsey Williams is Alex Jones in 5 to 8 years from now

2861
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:33,376
Early today I just realized that Alex is just in it for the money and I have nothing against him for making a living but

2862
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:34,144
This is too much

2863
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,960
It seems like a waste of my time

2864
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:43,360
Was just mostly Cut From the Same Cloth

2865
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:46,688
Look, they're like you clearly just in it for the money

2866
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:48,480
Golden

2867
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:52,576
And they do

2868
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:55,392
There would be more informative than this guy

2869
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:57,440
Nice

2870
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,464
Question

2871
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,024
Pass along information

2872
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,048
From others

2873
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:05,376
Ever be wrong even once

2874
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:12,288
The World by the Arctic

2875
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,080
For both enemies and allies

2876
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:15,360
And Alex's

2877
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,688
We got this guy

2878
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:22,016
Mitre oversold it a little bit based on the content that

2879
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,808
Please bring to the table

2880
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:25,600
Is really fascinating to me like

2881
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:27,392
Clear

2882
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,160
Gino's

2883
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:29,952
The game that is flatter Alex

2884
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:31,744
You'll be one of his go-to guy

2885
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:33,024
And Alex's

2886
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,304
Falling for you

2887
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,888
Absolutely

2888
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:39,424
B like this is only

2889
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,960
Six months after the episode where list

2890
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:47,360
Because he comes back later

2891
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,688
Okay okay

2892
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,480
Where he comes

2893
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,248
And he is now in

2894
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:56,320
Introduced his line of DVD he's starting to

2895
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:01,696
He's not doing much

2896
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:02,976
Walking on this episode

2897
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:06,560
He's laying the groundwork he's not in the rotation

2898
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
He's laying the seats

2899
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:10,912
We're going to Prosperity Gospel

2900
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,960
For later grow

2901
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:13,984
So

2902
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:24,480
Brilliant conman whose actual call is terrible

2903
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,504
But his game is good

2904
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,784
What is salt

2905
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:28,832
Is game is good in terms of like knowing

2906
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:31,392
This guy will help me move

2907
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:36,000
But the actual con is

2908
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,024
So thin

2909
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,816
Let The Listener see through it

2910
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:43,168
It seems like you're wrong about all these predictions

2911
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,216
Heavy cotton to pull

2912
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:47,008
On Alex Jones listeners

2913
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,872
You're you're bringing some weak sauce

2914
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:58,016

Figure out what cam going to work best

2925
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:22,080
I agree

2926
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,200
If I was going to become a con man

2927
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:29,248
Right I would do that first

2928
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,528
Get a basic

Over and over the room coming up with elaborate

Or something like that

2963
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:18,304

02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:45,696
Put on paper maybe a presentation

2972
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,720
He's not as crazy

2973
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:48,512
I think I think there's some

2974
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,048
Obviously fun

2975
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:52,096

Ages are to be the problem is that crazy

2979
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:04,128

I think a lot of people when we when you stayed like this

2981
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,272
This Gaston Alex Jones is crazy

2982
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,552
Most people are thinking

2983
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,368
He's going to say some wild s***

2984
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:18,976
Is crazy in like a like idiotic

2985
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,168

I've not seen any guests that there's been an insurrection

2987
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:35,872
That's pretty crazy

2988
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,152
Diploid

2989
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:40,480
Was worse atalissa

2990
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,760
Just because he

2991
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:44,576
He was so transparently bad at this

2992
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:50,720
Somebody stop listening to the show and now we know as we move forward when we hear him

2993
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:51,744
Like we know

2994
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,512

3018
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,496
Commercial Payday 2

3019
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:35,264
Together

3020
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:37,312
Because I'm a Muslim

3021
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:39,104
He said he repeated that question

3022
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:39,872
2 *

3023
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:43,712
Do you think that that will have any effect on how he governs our

3024
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:50,368
So hold on for a second and imagine imagine that interview

3025
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:57,536
Why did you give us so we can all get along

3026
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:04,704
Very ideas that is so hilarious

3027
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:10,080
Play into their fears

3028
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:16,480
I want to bring the worlds

3029
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,760
Together so we stopped killing

3030
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:18,528
Each other

3031
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:20,576
Because I'm a Muslim

3032
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:21,600
And you're like

3033
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:24,160
So does that

3034
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:28,512
So that's a good thing you guys still complaining that he's a member of Reverend Wright

3035
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:34,912
Cuz he's a Muslim

3036
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:35,936
Christian

3037
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:39,776
Monster with and he's got Weather Underground

3038
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:41,056
Man it's so funny

3039
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,080
Is the idea

3040
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:46,432
In my mind I'm picturing it and stuck behind this venue

3041
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:58,208
I don't know how to play it out in words

3042
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,744
Picture of my head

3043
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,072
Alright

3044
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,608
Obama

3045
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:06,912
Walking out the back door he's got his bodyguard

3046
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:09,472
There is a row of children

3047
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:11,008
All wanting autograph

3048
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:13,568
Comes up to him

3049
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,592
And he's like

3050
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:17,408
What

3051
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,200
He's in the middle of signing an autograph

3052
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:22,272
He's signing it.

3053
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,296
Cuz I want

3054
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:24,064
Jews

3055
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:24,832
Muslims

3056
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:26,368
And Christians all to get along

3057
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:27,136
Together

3058
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
Crabs

3059
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:34,304
The autograph note tears it up throws it across a girl's throat

3060
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:40,448
Mic drop

3061
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:41,984
Country

3062
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:46,080
It's already having a second look at the bill he signed yesterday

3063
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:51,200
And he made the statement he said I was elected president I will drop the building

3064
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:54,272
It's disgust

3065
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,296
Bergenfield

3066
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:56,320
The burn exercise

3067
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:58,112
Running reporter down to ask

3068
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:59,904
To admit that he was a Muslim man

3069
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:01,696
And also one last point

3070
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,744
About how to prepare

3071
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:06,048
Power Probe

3072
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:09,376
People need to start vacuum sealing ammunition

3073
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:11,168
And Beyond

3074
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:18,080
Wagon right now

3075
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:24,480
You go look for it you try to find it

3076
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:27,040
Kind of

3077
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,112
So do you know

3078
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:32,672
Do you know what happened with the bullet

3079
02:33:35,232 --> 02:33:36,000
Around this time

3080
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:40,608
Savon

3081
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:45,984
The government was just buying up all the ammunition to remember him

3082
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:48,544
The 2008 election of Barack Obama

3083
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:53,664
Increase sales in both firearms and ammunition

3084
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,968
Reloading components

3085
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:58,528
Dealer

3086
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,088
She was selling

3087
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:04,416
Semi-automatic rifle

3088
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,208
You can put them on the Shelf

3089
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:11,072
The issue was not ever that the government was buying up stuff

3090
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:17,472
It was that these people these propagandist were creating such a fervor of they're going to take your gun

3091
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:18,240
Everyone

3092
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:20,288
Bought out the stocks do f******

3093
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:21,056
Fast

3094
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,080
There was

3095
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,616
8 legitimate

3096
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:25,920
Here's long ammunition shortage

3097
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:30,272
So that was the 1929 stock market crash of

3098
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:31,808
Yep essentially

3099
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:36,416
I mean you can look into it there was a almost 5 year long just run on bullet

3100
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:41,280
Cause of all this. Like you can't get it

3101
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:43,072
Go to a gun show at any f*****

3102
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:45,632
Pinpoint

3103
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:48,704
Shows around

3104
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:55,104
And I wish I could find guns that seems like the obvious answered cuz we got

3105
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,128
So many

3106
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,688
Is America ready for a black president

3107
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:02,528
When you see the ammunition sales are

3108
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:04,320
Stocks are disappearing

3109
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,856
The answer is no guys

3110
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:07,136
The answer is no

3111
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:10,720
People are buying them or semi-automatic weapon

3112
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:14,048
America is not ready for a black president not just

3113
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,608
Also guns

3114
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,632
All of it

3115
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,912
It was because

3116
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,728
These right-wing propaganda

3117
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:23,520
Pushed

3118
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,080
Tumi

3119
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:28,384
I think this is a good place to end the episode

3120
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,920
Because it's so

3121
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:31,200
The

3122
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:31,968
Narrative

3123
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:33,504
Because they are

3124
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,272
Because

3125
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:36,320
They also

3126
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:37,344
Are benefiting

3127
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,112
From

3128
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,136
The

3129
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:41,184
Lack of product

3130
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,744
Their rhetoric about their becoming a

3131
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,280
After being a black president

3132
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:46,304
He's what

3133
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
Cause

3134
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:50,656
Do you run on

3135
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:56,288
Like the government buying up all right

3136
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:59,872
Circle

3137
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:00,896
HD ever

3138
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:02,688
Tree of propaganda

3139
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:03,456
That's f******

3140
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,224
Gorgeous

3141
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:06,016
And you see this order thing you're like

3142
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:07,808
I don't think there's any hope

3143
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:11,904
But this is no this is what's fascinating about

3144
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:14,208
Because I do kind of think

3145
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,000
Cuz we're we're way wrong

3146
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:17,024
Here's what

3147
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,048
They're really say

3148
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,352
The entire propaganda is

3149
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:23,424
There's a black president

3150
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:26,240
Now black people are going to do to us what we did

3151
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:27,520
So we need to buy

3152
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:33,664
They wouldn't say that way but that's the real heart of all of their fears

3153
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:37,504
Is there a we're like the more they get bitching about

3154
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:42,368
I don't want to feel guilty for being white right what they really mean is I don't want to be

3155
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:44,928
Punished for all the s*** that I know weed

3156
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:49,792
I don't want to I don't want it brought up how much I've been in advantage

3157
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:51,328
Because of Britain

3158
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,096
And if

3159
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:55,424
If we give them power

3160
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,960
Which is the way they view it

3161
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:59,264
Figure out

3162
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:03,104
Then we're going to be

3163
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,944
And you know what is wrong

3164
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,736
For me

3165
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:15,136
The last episode

3166
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:18,976
Talk about

3167
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:24,864
There's more of them destroy all of us

3168
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:26,144
Is a fear of like

3169
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,168
I want

3170
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:31,520
To do that I think they would do that if they had one

3171
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:37,920
It's like

3172
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,456
Because on some intrinsic

3173
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:43,296
That suggests they are well aware that people have committed

3174
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:44,320
The worst crap

3175
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,368
Know that they are well

3176
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:48,928
And so it's it's

3177
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,744
It really does

3178
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,560
Crazy you can you can either accept that reality

3179
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:55,328
And

3180
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:58,656
Move forward with that or you can do the white thing

3181
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:01,984
Which is create your own alternative reality where you're always the best

3182
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:09,920
Investigation we are

3183
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:11,200
Dangerously close

3184
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:13,504
The beginning of the public

3185
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,528
Very excited

3186
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,088
See what happens with that will be there shortly

3187
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,112
But

3188
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:18,880
For now

3189
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,416
What we've learned

3190
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:21,952
Not a lot

3191
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:25,024
Mostly stuff we already knew

3192
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,304
Just whisk

3193
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:32,704
How long

3194
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,080
Real shortly

3195
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:38,848
And

3196
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:39,872
Big enough

3197
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,456
I know

3198
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,784
Liver of a

3199
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:49,344
Is heroin much like it's learn

3200
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:54,720
Away from being able to make this announcement all millions of those atoms

3201
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,256
Absolutely

02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:59,072

02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:44,544

Situational because you are such a flagrant conman

3288
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,776
You invalidate a lot of criticism against
