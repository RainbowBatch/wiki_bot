Dan  00:59
Hey, everybody, welcome back. No trade. I'm Dan. I'm trying to like sit around worship at the altar of saline and talk a little bit about Alex June. Oh, indeed.

Jordan  01:07
We are Dan Jordan,

Dan  01:08
Dan Jordanna question for you. So it's a great spot today. But my bright spot today, Jordan as I found a great show. They need something to be watching to while they play with the button. Sure. Buttons. Yeah. So I had survivor last time around. Sure. Which was great. Because I've made it all the way through. Yeah. And Hurrah.

Jordan  01:28
I very legally got you some New Zealand survivor, I believe. Yes. Yeah.

Dan  01:32
I have not tapped into that. Yeah, I actually forgot that. I had that. And I would also like to say

Alex Jones  01:38
thank you, Jordan goddamnit. Thanks for getting those.

Dan  01:43
So I was looking around on Paramount plus, and I saw that they had Unsolved Mysteries. Sure. So I've went back and I've watched a couple of those. I was texting you about how everything seems to happen at gas stations, all these crimes stations, stay away from gas station where they are back in the 90s Stay away from a fucking guy. Everybody needed gas. So it was like the town square, right? Yeah. So it's like okay, execution style murder. And then the next story is about we found a bag of mail. Yes. And I said, I'm out. Well never know where this mail is. This show is so totally inconsistent. I am not gonna watch any of this show.

Jordan  02:20
I was like, it was like a palate cleanser. You know, like, oh, this execution style murder. That's very, very terrifying. But this innocuous mail also, maybe there's ghosts. Oh, that's probably bad.

Dan  02:30
So I decided to skip away from that. And I found the show called contraption master. And it is great. It is a game show Who got that name through. It's a little clunky contraption Master? Yeah. Oh, boy. So it's, there's this guy who kind of looks like a friendly happy British Al Pacino. Okay, and he's hosting a show where two teams compete to create the first episode they have to like I think it's they have to get this tea kettle turned on from the tub. So it's all

Jordan  03:08
Rube Goldberg. Yeah. All Rube Goldberg machines. Okay. All right, room

Dan  03:12
Rube Goldberg machine. All right. They've three days one, one day in each room to make these elaborate contraption. I love it. Yeah. And the guy who judges it every episode he's like a world famous Contraption Maker.

Jordan  03:30
impeachable the great.

Dan  03:32
I think it's called a chain reaction machine is what they call it.

Jordan  03:36
You just can't call it a Rube Goldberg machine for the rest of your life but

Dan  03:39
what I respect about it is even he is like, I love these things because they're so cartoonish. You know at least there's a recognition of how ridiculous yeah but he they have a great respect for like explaining to the audience like physics little bit you know, there's there's the like, here's why this work right.

Jordan  03:58
Rare tropical force and all of those kind of fun thing. Yeah. So

Dan  04:02
there's a light educational aspect to it. But it's so fun. I really, really like it.

Jordan  04:06
I mean, here's here's what happened was the British Bake Off exploded and then Britain has slowly clawed through every possible thing that they could get a small group of people to do competitively. Yeah, like a they've gone through pottery. They've gone through gardening. They've gone through. I mean, it's it's absurd.

Dan  04:28
I don't watch most of them.

Jordan  04:29
I will. I don't

Dan  04:31
know how they do it. Yeah, contraption one's good. That's great. Recommended.

Jordan  04:35
I appreciate again, I don't know how they got that Dave through.

Dan  04:38
contraption Master is not what Yeah, I would have been another pasa. Yeah, at least one or two. So what's your advice?

Jordan  04:45
My bright spot is Muramasa just released a new album. Okay. It is fan tastic. And I think I think you will appreciate the name. Man. It's demon time.

Dan  04:58
It's demon time. It's demon time. Okay,

Jordan  05:00
it's not an even fee.

Dan  05:03
Is it by by time?

Jordan  05:04
I don't know. I think there's something as I want to tracks it's I think it might be honestly. Yeah, something like that. But yeah, it's fantastic. Really, really good.

Dan  05:15
Here's what's great about this. I have no idea who this is. Yeah, and if I were to guess what genre it is? Sure. Give me a hot or cold. Okay. I guess the genre Okay. Classical.

Jordan  05:26
No, but that's also that is possible,

Dan  05:28
but I'm saying hot or cold. Oh, cold cold. Yes. Why cold? quite cold. Hip Hop. Hot. Hot. hotter. Yes. Instrumental hip hop.

Jordan  05:38
Oh, boy. Here's the problem with that. Okay. Yes. And no, ah,

Dan  05:46
jazz. Hip Hop.

Ron DeSantis  05:51
Really? Yeah. Okay.

Jordan  05:52
Yeah, buddy James hop. I mean, he's a producer. So it's okay to electric. You know, it's whenever a producer does a hip hop album it's about how spectacular they can make all is

Dan  06:02
it is instrumental or is there there's

Jordan  06:05
there's he used to be all instrumental and now he's got vocalist coming out the wazoo. vocalist, he's getting big manga.

Dan  06:12
Yeah, I do enjoy some of that, that the genre is

Jordan  06:18
tracked. lovesick fuck went all over the place. It was an amazing track. Really, really good.

Dan  06:24
I look, I have no problem with that title. I'm not a square you it sounds like you're square. I just remember how funny I thought it was. When a con and Eminem came out with that song. I want to fuck you. It's just like, why? What is this? Right? You're adults, right?

Jordan  06:46
It's ridiculous. See, I appreciated that. What makes me laugh. You want this to be on the radio? What makes me laugh is not that that I appreciate

Dan  06:56
the one with Snoop. That might have been the one that Snoop Dogg

Jordan  06:59
that makes me laugh is Let's make love parentheses with Tim McGraw. It'll never it'll never had Faith Hill and Tim McGraw didn't do it called Let's Make Love. It's titled Let's make love parentheses with Tim McGraw. I don't know why. That's the worst thing I've ever heard. It's terrible. It's terrible. What are you doing?

Dan  07:19
So Jordan today? We have an episode to go over and it too is terrible. Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, we're gonna be talking about the end of last week Thursday and Friday the 15th and 16th of September and you know, trying to track the goings on of Alex on his show as the trial progresses. Not much, not much going on. Yeah,

Jordan  07:40
we've lived in reality during this time. What's he been living in? Not much. That's kind of

Dan  07:45
what I was expecting. It's dumb. It's but it's not dominant. Interesting way. It's kind of like, blustery but not in a font. Like it's I don't know, there's just, there's not a lot is what I'm saying. Yeah, and we're picking on those bones. Yeah. And Tuesday, I believe is when Alex has said that he's going to Connecticut. Right. So I foresee that probably this whole week. There's not Alex isn't gonna be at Studio. Yep. He said that Alex Stein is hosting for him on Tuesday. What that troll guy really? Yeah.

Jordan  08:17
Damn now. That names too close to a comic that we know. It's not Alex. No, it's not.

Dan  08:27
Alex stone. Well, there's definitely that guy. I think that's a comic who you

Jordan  08:33
know, I think is Yeah.

Dan  08:35

And we got to take a credit in the mixture. And I know that we're always behind on stuff always behind and so what I thought we would do flip the script now and be early. Okay. See, so we got an ad anniversary message early.

Jordan  10:05
I love it. I love it.

Dan  10:07
The alternative really is that we do it in six months. Yeah.

Jordan  10:10
I mean, we can't do once we know about it. It either happens or it doesn't. This is from Jessie.

Dan  10:15
For Keroh. Happy first anniversary. This is on October 18. So we're about a month ahead. Okay,

Jordan  10:21
good news.

Dan  10:22
I know my country is crazy. But at least we have Dan and Jordan to listen to looking forward to visiting Germany again as soon as we can. Thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

Alex Jones  10:32
I'm a policy wonk. I have risen above my enemies. I might quit tomorrow. Actually. I'm just gonna take a little break now. A little breaky for me. And then we're going to come back. And I'm going to start the show over, but I'm the devil. I gotta be daring on air. Fuck you. Fuck you. I got plenty of words for you. But at the end of the day, Fuck you and your new world order. And fuck the horse she wrote in on and all your shit. Maybe today's grandma's broadcast? Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years. Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow. And you never see me again. That's really what I want to do. I never want to come back here again. I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air. I'll be better tomorrow.

Dan  11:27
It's not really no no bail. So here Jordan is and our contracts dropped from today's show and I think this fits for just about any time Alex has a guest

Alex Jones  11:35
Okay, that was special guests coming up next Gower more on Yep.

Dan  11:42
That's that's always

Jordan  11:47
okay. All right. Okay,

Dan  11:50
so we start here on the 15th where Alex begins and it's a getting repetitive

Alex Jones  11:56
Oh, model is rarely set. Empire is on the Rhine. The great Risha in the world The world is now number one on Amazon number one book in the world topping all charge thanks for the people's homes for the truth

Tucker Carlson  12:14
The New York Times it's really a philosophical questions. Okay, you're directly in let's see, how drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers game?

Dan  12:22
Yep. So we got this we got this going on. I'm still playing the Tucker clip Yeah. Multiple times on on this on this day.

Jordan  12:30
Yeah, you know I'm starting to get offended on behalf of Packer fans. Wait, who's Tucker to talk shit to Packer fans. Hey, love these people at a at a Green Bay stadium. Come on, man lost it's cold out it is cold Tucker probably freeze to death. He doesn't have anything. He's got nothing on a Packer fan. Oh, so

Dan  12:49
I decided to check in here with the the books on Amazon. And when we last checked out, which was at number five on Amazon Jennette McCurdy number four killing it. Steve Doocy. Number two amazing cookbook. Yeah. Steve Doocy has arisen to number one with his cookbook.

Jordan  13:07
What is it gonna take for the world to make sense to me? Ah, okay, here's what I need. All right. I'm a huge fan of Steve Doocy. But not for his not for his political takes. Man. His wife has some great recipe political bakes. That's what we're here for.

Dan  13:25
Jennette McCurdy number five. Okay, dropped a little bit a little bit out for a few weeks. Yep. Sticking with it. Good for her. Alex is at number 12. Ooh, down out of the top 10 Little bit of a slide out of the top 10 I think the interest in that book is probably blown over. It's probably done what it's going to do. Yeah. Yep. Trying to look through this list, see if there's anything else interesting.

Jordan  13:48
I mean, I could see it becoming like a I could see it becoming like a posthumous thing. You know, like people didn't really appreciate James Joyce until after he was dead. And I think I haven't not read the book. I can only compare it to what I assume is its closest literary equivalent, which is Ulysses. So I'm imagining that the portrait

Dan  14:11
of an artist does. That's Alex's.

Jordan  14:15
That's a good one. Off dinners, that can be a good one nipping

Dan  14:18
on Alex's heels, The Very Hungry Caterpillar Daleks in terms of Amazon say, Oh, what are you gonna do? So congratulations on that. Maybe? Maybe it's a little a little past time to stop tooting your own horn on this one,

Jordan  14:35
maybe a little bit.

Dan  14:36
So Alex is a very exciting guest coming up later, the author of the 100

Alex Jones  14:40
day September 2022. Alex Jones, we have a huge guest who worked in Health and Human Services and was an adviser to President Trump, who warned him about Operation warp speed, and who witnessed Birx and Fauci and others bragging out there We're setting trump up for a fall. This is gonna be a huge in studio interview in two hours, or an hour and 15 minutes or so, at 1pm Central Standard Time

Dan  15:13
really hyping this thing up. Yeah. So this is Dr. Paul Alexander. Okay. He's been I think he's been on before or at least Alex has talked about him because we've covered him. He's the guy who was like a radio guest that was beloved by one of the people in Trump's administration's Kabuto. Michael Caputo. Yeah. And so he got brought in as an advisor to the HHS right. And he was the guy who's like, Give everyone COVID. Yeah, yeah. Need to get herd immunity now. Yep. And so we've already talked about I don't know is interviews just like I thought everyone should get sick. Yeah, yeah, that was a protect the really vulnerable people in society, and then just let everyone get it. Damn the torpedoes. Yeah. And it's not an interesting interview. It's not groundbreaking at

Jordan  16:00
all. Yeah, I mean, I would say, somebody, essentially arguing for a culling of human beings is probably not going to give a good interview.

Dan  16:10
Well, I can kind of understand where the thought comes from, you know, like I can kind of understand, I think it's misguided. Yeah. But like the the notion of having a discussion about like whether herd immunity is the right way to go at the beginning of an outbreak chair, I can understand that. One of the reasons that I think, especially now as we've gotten further on, I think one of the reasons why you wouldn't necessarily want to do that, particularly with like, a really novel, unknown thing is you don't know these. Yeah, for effect, that's the one you don't know what syndromes can be caused, or brought on by having, right, the virus. And there's, there's a lot of unknown, unknown show, as it were,

Jordan  16:52
I mean, I just I come from it from this place of saying, like, what is the point of living in the fucking future if your plan for dealing with a pandemic is still like, hey, let's all get together and have a party and get sick and then we will be over

Dan  17:07
be? Beatle song, not good health strategy.

Jordan  17:11
Computers in space, there's computers in space, and I still have to get sick bullshit. No refuse.

Dan  17:18
Well, I mean, you could just ask Alex to get the globalists health machine. See, that's what I'm saying. The cure is yours. Absolutely. So there's a big news going on. And that is that Ron DeSantis is a fuckhead. Yeah, he's

Jordan  17:32
a Nazi. Yeah, he

Dan  17:33
sent immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. Yep. Yep. Some have described this as human trafficking.

Jordan  17:40
I mean, it is I don't know how this Phoenicians I don't know how this isn't a crime that we're gonna rescue him for. You can't lie to people put them in a plane and then send them to a different state that's flying. And that's bad on like a legal level on some way.

Dan  17:57
Right. I think so. Yesterday, Alex loves it.

Jordan  17:59
No, of course,

Alex Jones  18:00
shuffling where the people are striking back with common sense. The governor of Texas is finally doing something good. The governor DeSantis of Florida to continue to do great stuff, are delivering illegal aliens to Kamala Harris his house. And also That's Texas doing that. And to Martha's Vineyard, and one of the most elite areas in the country where Barack Obama and all these other globalist had giant mansions.

Dan  18:23
Yeah. So I mean, like, you know, if you want to look at this as human trafficking, Alex thinks that's a good common sense political tool. It's cool. So Ron DeSantis, should be in prison for this stuff that he's pulled, which Alex is fully in favor of, because he has an opposition to immigration DeSantis charter two flights and sent immigrants to Martha's Vineyard specifically, because it's an area that's a symbol of rich liberal elites, you can see how that shorthand is very clear in the way that Alex describes the place. If that all wasn't bad enough, the immigrants were lied to. When they were about where they weren't going. Right. One of them told reporters quote, when we got on the plane, they told us they would give us jobs a place to live everything. Another said quote, I simply feel misled because they told a lie, and it has come to nothing. According to Domingo Garcia, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the people who are who were being used as political props were even given fake documents that were meant to fool them into thinking that there was a more official backing to the idea that jobs and housing were waiting for them. Interestingly, According to NPR, these flights were paid for by DeSantis but originated in Texas which does seem to imply some level of fucked up coordination between him and Texas Governor Abbott or else I guess maybe is this an urge state kidnapping?

Jordan  19:41
Did Am I Am I understanding this story correctly? If so, so by by DeSantis is best a group of people chartered and and paid for a group of people were lied to were told that they were going to be given a better life. If They got on this plane Yeah. And then they landed and it was a and then yeah and then fucking like that's what happened like that's what and then and then we're all going to act like that's not a crime that if you were I did would be a crime crime

Dan  20:16
it'd be a wild thing

Jordan  20:17
it would be an illegal thing for me to

Dan  20:18
do NPR talked to some of the immigrants and here's their description. Quote the migrant said a woman they identified as Perla approached them outside the shelter and lured them into boarding the plane saying that they would be flown to Boston where they could get expedited workpapers She provided them with food. The migrant said Perla was trying to recruit more passengers just hours before their flight. In addition to all this horrific bullshit, they didn't inform the folks doing this transportation to these migrants didn't inform officials in Martha's Vineyard of the people's arrival specifically, so they could be caught off guard and chaos would be more likely because that's the goal here. Sure. This is an unacceptable and debased level of political theater where we need to stop as a country and recognize that things have just gotten too far. And the things that we're accepting are really far past what's decent. The fact that the organizers of this stunt which involves fraud, potential human trafficking, and possibly some other crimes have the fact that they haven't been arrested already is a fucking bummer. Yeah, that's insane. The game that's being played here is really simple. Ron DeSantis wanted to send immigrants to liberal areas because he hates immigrants. And he thinks that liberals are all talk when it comes to supporting immigration. Unfortunately, if he were to inform officials in these liberal areas that immigrants were coming, they would be able to prepare and accommodate them, which wouldn't really cause any problems and there isn't propaganda value in that. However, if you don't tell officials, and you defraud the migrants with promises of housing and work, then you create a situation where the officials in the liberal area you're targeting are going to be outraged. They're not, they're gonna be super offended that you would do this to people and likely speak out against you for it, then you ignore their criticism about how what you did was fraud, and possibly human trafficking, and pretend they're just mad at you because you send immigrants to their pressure, their precious liberal enclave, you then sell that message to your audience to reinforce your narrative than in reality, no one wants immigrants around and liberals are just lying about it. Fuck this shit. Fuck these people. And fuck Alex and his inability to even be consistent on the one big thing he's supposed to be caring about so much. The king of human trafficking, corruption sniffing it out, man. He doesn't care about any of his principles. He claims me and so much they're all negotiable when there's a chance to quote own the libs. Yeah. Or to advance extreme right wing politics. Yeah,

Jordan  22:34
yeah, it is. It is nice to be reminded that laws are pretend, though. And that all you really need to do is amass enough power and a small enough area that you can control that you can get away with doing whatever it is you want. It's I mean, laws don't mean anything. I mean, they're not arrested. Yeah, I mean, I appreciate that. We're all up in arms about the Supreme Court's rulings. But if Ron DeSantis can do that, then all you really need to do to get an abortion is get a bunch of people around you with guns and then go get an abortion and then shoot somebody if they tried to stop DeSantis is gonna win fucking insane reelection and Jesus Christ.

Dan  23:09
He's something he's gonna go to prison and he's gonna win. I know, election. I know. Any beer contestant is like, 2024. Presidential I

Jordan  23:17
refuse to believe laws matter. It's over.

Dan  23:21
I tried to imagine myself in a younger time, like, I don't know. 1015 years ago, experiencing some of this stuff. Yeah, it's like, now this is I have I have a tough time. I have a tough time putting these events into other periods of time. Yeah, I mean, I Yeah, it's a mess. Yeah. Yo, Russia is losing in Ukraine now. Yeah. And Alex is known this was gonna happen. Okay. And, and there's a new story as to what's been going on. All right.

Alex Jones  23:56
We also have huge news dealing with Russia. And I mean, this news is so dangerous and so out of control. I don't even know where to begin. They tried to kill Putin. Turns out a month ago, Ukraine's bragging, Russia confirms that Putin did survive an assassination attempt. They killed a bunch of Russian generals, Alexander Dugan, his daughter, a bunch of other journalists, and they've killed a bunch of other Russian leaders. So the globalist are in Russia assassinating people, and carbonium shooting them, strangling them poisoning them. I mean, we are at war with Russia. I'm sorry, whether border with high tech weapons. And yes, the Russians have put up a big fight. But yeah, they're losing. And so what the Russians do when they lose when they start losing? Well, Russians get very coalescent hardline and they go crazy.

Dan  24:51
Now see, this sounds like a guy who's questioning things. Wow. This seems like a guy who's just got questions, not a guy who's Say I'm just making every event so that's why I'm making definitive statements

Jordan  25:05
made up of nine assassination attempt odd Putin

Dan  25:09
rumors that were going around logs. Yeah, that's not confirmed. Yeah, stuff but Alex is taking it is very serious and very real. And I bet it probably had to do with like, slow acting sedatives that they were putting in Putin's Diet Coke, right

Jordan  25:22
right polonium, any number of different possible. Bad it is it is. Oh, we should feel bad. We should feel bad for for Russia because they're under attack by the globalists. That's why we feel bad. Well, yeah.

Dan  25:39
I mean, this is this is just the way that Alex has decided for today. Right. Do you argue? It's Russia as the non aggressor victim? As a as a country? Yes, yes. Fun. Yeah, that's great. So we get the COVID narrative of the day, we need a sound effect for that. We're gonna have to Yeah, we're never gonna do that. But COVID story of the day,

Alex Jones  26:02
even the British Medical Journal came out yesterday. We have the article right here, I'll show you in a moment and said, Okay, we think it came out of the lab. Well, it's known they scan the virus. It's artificial Chicon mirik. It's a match.

Dan  26:15
Do you believe this?

Jordan  26:17
That the British Medical Journal has suddenly taken a huge about face way long after it would make any sense and said that the COVID 19 came from a lab specifically probably one in China. Yep. No, I don't believe that.

Dan  26:31
Good instincts. Thank you. This isn't even about the British Medical Journal. Okay, Alex as fuck that up, about an article published in The Lancet. Oh, okay. Okay, they put together a commission to identify lessons for the future that we can learn from COVID. And they didn't find that it came from a lab. From their key finding section, quote, The proximal origins of SARS Cove to remain unknown. There are two leading hypotheses that the virus emerged as a zoonotic spillover from wildlife or a farm animal possibly through a wet market in a location that is still undetermined, or that the virus emerged from a research related incident during the field collection of viruses or through a laboratory associated escape. Commissioners held diverse views about the relative probabilities of the two explanations, and both possibilities require further scientific investigation check. So that's what Alex's report oh man a little bit off.

Jordan  27:22
It is people who like to say definitive things do not like to read what scientists actually say no, but

Dan  27:29
this still just sounds like Alex's questioning thing.

Jordan  27:31
Yeah, no, he's questioning. Yeah,

Dan  27:33
he's entirely wrong about the commission's findings, and he has the source wrong because he doesn't know what he's talking about at all. And he's just making shit up as it goes along. Yeah, he sucks.

Jordan  27:42
That one's that one's bad. That one's pretty egregious though to be like, see, we already knew it was made up whenever it it's not from the medical journal. And it doesn't even man. Yeah, brutal.

Dan  27:55
So Alex as a guest, that's not this doctor who wants to get everyone sick chair. It is a guy who let me see if I can give you a clue that won't give it away. He sells pillows. Shit. Damn, that was too much of a clue. too good

Jordan  28:11
of a clue. You know? I don't remember. I don't know who invented the cert. They didn't NASA they invented the memory foam.

Dan  28:18
He didn't he didn't invent any pill. Oh just sells them. Alright, fine.

Jordan  28:21
I think I know who it is. He

Dan  28:23
has a mustache. Oh shit. Michael indels on.

Alex Jones  28:27
All right, two days ago. He's on a hunting trip early in the morning stops in to get breakfast at a Hardee's and a bunch of FBI vehicles surrounding him. He's told that story. I'll recap. He's got breaking news now on what's happening. He's being investigated for investigating election fraud. That's all these news that we're finding stolen voting machines. The FBI wanted to come look at it. I guess he was human smuggling across the border. Shipping and fentanyl are doing a drag queen storytime. It'd be okay. But because Michael Sandel is trying to have integrity and investigate election fraud. He is persona non grata.

Dan  28:59
No, I think that that stuff that was stolen from voting machines is being investigated. Yeah, some of Michael Dell's associates are very likely going to go to prison.

Jordan  29:08
Well see, that is where we get into an issue. So

Dan  29:11
this investigation is happening. It's just not happening the way Alex wants it to.

Jordan  29:14
Right. Right. Because

Dan  29:15
they're talking about fake things.

Jordan  29:17
Right. Well, I mean, what's fun about that is that is in a backdoor way will force them to investigate the voting machines. You know what I'm saying? Like, fine, we'll finally look into your bullshit so we can prove you're a crime committed. Yeah.

Dan  29:33
Well, I mean, you know, there is an argument to be made that technology is gotten too out of hand and you know, that takes away the ability for people to vote should have real assurance in their vote and which is why I think we need to go back to the broken pieces of pottery, I think a brilliant pasta. We use to to vote. No other system is acceptable.

Jordan  29:55
I would go with throwing a dog food Okay. At the prettiest person that we can find

Dan  30:03
how was that a vote?

Jordan  30:08
What was years ago? Yeah. Oh, okay.

Dan  30:14
Mike, God, I don't even know how to fucking say this 700 episodes ago

Jordan  30:23
Oh boy.

Dan  30:24
700 episodes, we ran into a fella. Yes. And Mike has been defrauded by him.

Alex Jones  30:31
Then he went into another question. He goes, When did you first meet Gina Peters. And I go on at the cyber symposium, you guys already know that.

Dan  30:40
He's talking about the FBI asking him questions. Yeah.

Alex Jones  30:43
I said, I flew in from all over our country, cyber experts, and people are people from around the country, politicians stuff. And then I said, I said, Oh, you must be talking about the Dennis Montgomery terabytes that I own now, which is sitting by the way, everybody in Nevada that the government has a gag order on as soon as that Judge lifts and all this stuff goes away. 32 terabytes of the whole election of November 3 to November 6. That's what I think they're afraid of.

Dan  31:13
They're not they are afraid of anything that has anything to do with Dennis Montgomery. Holy shit that brings it sucking Guy Yeah, that's

Jordan  31:22
that's a real full circle moment.

Dan  31:25
good at this. Yeah, he is so good at scamming these these money marks on the right. It's outrageous.

Jordan  31:33
He's got it. He's got an Mo Yeah. And it's not like it's hard to how do you not just talk to somebody else who has been scammed by Dennis Montgomery and be like, Oh, okay, nevermind.

Dan  31:44
Is Joe Arpaio? Not in Mark. Again, Mike Lynn Dells Rolodex,

Jordan  31:48
they all know each other. He's scamming them one by one and their friends.

Dan  31:52
Yeah. Couldn't Alex warn him? Alex has had run ins.

Jordan  31:57
You know, maybe they're just too embarrassed to admit that they got scammed. So they're like, oh, man, oops, you're in there with Dennis Montgomery.

Dan  32:03
I think a lot of them probably are, I think shocking about it is Mike's willingness to say this came from Dennis Montgomery. He doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know that that name is something that like, all right, or it's something that gives you a like, Oh, your arguments don't. Yep, this is bad. There's nothing here. You have invalidated your old point by bringing a noted career con man. Who did I mean defraud the government? Certainly, yeah, man successfully defrauded the government. He's good at defrauding

Jordan  32:36
people of stuff. Yeah, he just knows who to pick to fraud,

Dan  32:40
I think but look in the past. No, yes. Yeah. In the present. I don't think it takes much skill to notice that Mike Lyndale is gullible has a lot of money. He's

Jordan  32:49
right. There he is. He's right there. Yeah. That is that for a con man to walk by Mike Lindahl without trying to steal something must require superhuman. Yeah.

Dan  33:01
Gotta give up your con card.

Jordan  33:03
Yeah. Got to try and caught him out of something.

Dan  33:06
Yeah, got his watch. You didn't scam. Like Landbell get out a gun in your head. You're not at this meeting. Anyway.

Jordan  33:16
We got to stop meeting at the American Legion.

Dan  33:18
So I just I can't have any conclusion other than like, Dennis Montgomery got Mike bad. He taught him hard. Yeah. But

Alex Jones  33:26
finally, Mike, I can't think of anybody who's more Americana than you and you're a great American and we love you. And they're persecuting all of us together. These massive dragnets. They're panicking. They're trying to get ready to steal the next election. If any four days. I think you're dead on they are they are scared of the proof of what you've discovered. Can you speak to that? Yep. Yeah, well, they were they're very worried everybody. And I want everybody to know, you know, I've had Dennis Montgomery's terabytes, for the last year and a half. And there's a reason at the cyber symposium that we were advised not to put out the China thing and all the terabytes. Yeah, third day, a year ago at the cyber symposium was so everybody at the moment of truth Summit. Right on stage, we had the attorney up there, and he told us why we could not drop them.

Dan  34:14
So I just want to stop it really quick. Because I think there's something so fucking funny about this being the moment of truth Summit. At the last minute, we're like, oh, we're not gonna put this out. Yeah, it was the

Jordan  34:24
moment of truth it was literally it could not be more named so ironic thing is I mean, yeah.

Alex Jones  34:33
Yeah, time to the public. There is a government gag order on this information. I don't believe that that will stop me from putting it out there. Because now I own all this stuff. And I bought the the different stuff that patents that Dennis Montgomery has, and one of the smartest men I've ever known by the way

Dan  34:53
Oh, just so sad. So sad. There's no gag order. They're never they're all It is a gag order with Dennis. stuff, but there isn't because it's made up.

Jordan  35:04
It's made up pretend on, I believe,

Dan  35:08
Mike Lindell probably quite a bit of money for some battens that aren't real and some information that is amazing. Not good or not related or made up, you know, wow, if he

Jordan  35:21
weren't such a piece of shit and the information wasn't used so negatively. I mean, I wish I had defrauded this many right wing pro propagandist. That's an accomplishment. That's an achievement that I do respect. I think more people should screw these guys out of their money because they're dumb.

Dan  35:40
It is just something that is so weird to that he is this thing that keeps coming up. You know? That you would not expect that this con man I just run through so many.

Jordan  35:53
Still. I haven't we haven't even talked about him in

Dan  35:57
forever. It's been a while. At least this one is from Friday.

Jordan  36:01
Yeah. Oh, crazy. Yep. Oh, man.

Dan  36:04
I felt like somebody was saying that he was dead. Recently. Is

Jordan  36:08
he not dead? I don't know. I kind of thought he was dead. The first time we talked about him. Dead his Montgomery

Dan  36:15
investigation. 700 700 and some odd episodes ago. Yeah. No, he's I think he's still kicking. Yeah, he's 69 years young.

Jordan  36:25
Oh, nice.

Dan  36:30
So he got Mike Lindell. Yep, got him hard.

Jordan  36:32
Who do you think he's gonna get next? We need to have a pool. We need to have like a ton teen version?

Dan  36:38
I think it'll be someone we're not aware of. Yeah, right. So I will rise to prominence.

Jordan  36:42
I don't know. I don't know. Once I hear Tucker say those two magic talker. Dennis Montgomery. It'll be tomorrow. It'll be the day. Yep.

Alex Jones  36:50
Or you can go to Dennis montgomery.com. And see that, oh, Dennis is real. He worked for the government. He made this thing called Hammer scorecard for the government. They tried to steal elections amongst other things, or that that's what our GM was going to do spy on other elections around the world. But our government turned us turn it on the United States, turn this on our own people. And now it's sitting. The government doesn't want you to see this everybody. And that government is sitting down there. If that Judge releases this to the public, if they release this to the public, it's over everybody. I have some like termites. They're definitely scared of you. They're trying to shut you down. They're trying to shut me down. So the listeners the viewers, Mike Mandel, Alex Jones are all in a symbiotic defense pack here. You need money to keep your employees hired and fighting and the great job you're doing. We need funds. Even a big sponsor, people can go to any of your big sites at checkout get up to 60% discount on hundreds of amazing items. And not just your items. But all these other made American companies tell people have not heard about my pillow.com promo code Alex at checkout for giant savings. So you can also sponsor us we really appreciate it. But your new website as well.

Dan  38:00
It really feels like these two dudes are playing different games. Yeah. Like Lindale doesn't realize the Montgomery's a long term con man who's been part of at least a few of Alex's busted narratives in the past and Alex knows not to take that shit seriously. Because of that, or just because he's out of his mind. Lyndale seems like he actually believes that if this information gets out, yeah, it's gonna have a huge political effect. Conversely, Alex's wants Mike's money and he knows that the only way to get it is to allow him to say whatever he wants on air, he hasn't taken his Montgomery shit seriously, or else he would be insisting that this is the biggest story in the world and he'd be covering it wall to wall Yeah, instead of being this blase nonsense that you hand wave away to get your promo code totally promotion. Like Michael Sandel is that guy that you just gotta like? I don't he has too much hubris or something because like anybody who was a right wing propaganda is worth a damn yeah, we're just be like, shut up. Yep. Shut up. Yep. Don't say anything. Just give me money. Let me put your message out. You're doing this poorly, you know, like, but he can't you and if you want his money, you have to let him talk. And when he talks, he reveals that he's working on information from Dennis Montgomery. And the whole thing's busted. Yeah, he needs an intermediary for like is his message but he's not going to fund an intermediary. Right? Right. That's gonna be a deal breaker.

Jordan  39:25
He wants apeshit crazy out there. And he is going to pay out the wazoo to get a bit crazy now

Dan  39:31
at the same time, and that's what you are. I don't think that he recognizes

Jordan  39:36
he does not he does not. I mean, I hate it whenever I hear him talk because if he was yelling about like, the fucking betting lines for football on Sundays on ESPN or something, I think that could work. His voice is right for like, like I believe it's over three. You know, like I would give him on the field gold Like, that works for me, but this is sad. This is a terrifying man. And Alex knows he's getting scammed. He's letting his montgomery.com

Dan  40:09
That's why Alex is like I bought her book and get some pillow money. Yeah, no shit. Yeah, all right, well, hey, floodgates are open. You're taking your given Montgomery money gonna give me some to damn it. Yeah,

Jordan  40:22
I'm gonna have to go ahead and say that, ethically speaking, Alex is piggybacking on Dennis Montgomery is defrauding of Mike limb Dell, right? Oh, no, I

Dan  40:30
don't know when the Montgomery information started to be part of Windows thing. So Alex might have been calling him before.

Jordan  40:37
Hmm. Who knows? Who knows when the first con began?

Dan  40:41
Yeah. We were so young. Yes. So Alex gets back to talking about the immigrants coming to Martha's Vineyard, and he's a liar.

Alex Jones  40:50
They're not bunch of little kids that have been kidnapped by the Democrats all over the country. They're, they're shipping men, men, to all these different places that smart Santas and of habit to not be involved with trafficking of children. But if you're gonna come here illegally, DHS is gonna let him go. We're gonna put them on buses and say, Hey, you're not going to Southside Chicago or South Dallas. And I mean, talking super dangerous places like South Dallas and South Chicago, you aren't going to the Bronx, you're not going to Harlem, you're not going to DC. You are going to Martha's Vineyard, or you're going to Kamala Harris's house.

Dan  41:27
So based on Alex's language, it seems like he's totally fine with human trafficking as long as it's adult men. Cool, man, good to know.

Jordan  41:36
And it's not. Yeah,

Dan  41:37
there were children sent to Martha's Vineyard. According to reporting available at the time, Alex is on air, the group included, quote, seven families with four children ranging from three to eight years old, Alex is lying to his audience, because he knows that the reality of what the scientists did looks really, really bad. And supporting it would be in direct contradiction with his imaginary principles. So in order to, you know, you don't have to choose between being a coward or having to denounce DeSantis. Instead, you just create a false reality to respond to. He's really lucky that none of his listeners really even care about what's true or not. Oh, shit, that's also the migrants were told they were going to Boston, on every level, this was a fraud being perpetuated at the expense of vulnerable people in order to score political points. And I mean, the also endangered them. Yeah, like, it's, that's outrageous. Yeah,

Jordan  42:27
yeah, I just, and to be to say, after we're just like, well, at least they weren't trafficking children, you know, like the Democrats do. And it's like, no, they were. And then he said, which they were smart not to do. And you're like, well, they wouldn't be if they hadn't, but they did. First off,

Dan  42:45
right. That's why I'm saying that how Alex is phrasing it when he is accepting that this is traffic. Yeah. If they sent children, it would be human trafficking children.

Jordan  42:55
And they did they did. So they are human traffickers, according to AL Yes. But instead of that, he's just going to say that the Democrats are human traffickers, and they are smart for and that Will

Dan  43:05
you deny that the thing happened and then people who did it didn't do it? Yeah,

Jordan  43:10
yeah. No. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Is that really is that really is gonna drive me insane. It really is gonna drive me insane. Well, let

Dan  43:17
me sue the brain. With Alex talking about cars.

Alex Jones  43:21
Yeah, 400 horsepower. Mustangs. Pretty good. I like that agreement. I was college. Try 1000. Dodge Hemi horsepower. With twin. Supercharged supercharges. Zero to 60 in about a second. Even beaten with them Tesla's dangerous 200 miles an hour? About eight seconds. That's black sunshine. You're going to see a leftist press down the accelerator. What should now that total eight 1am

Jordan  44:02
Is that political

Alex Jones  44:03
power, not that other word on it. They just don't get it. You're in the arena. And we are alive. Being alive means no, you're gonna die.

Dan  44:18
Being alive means wasting a full minute talking about nothing

Jordan  44:21
like you. Like you know, Lewis Hamilton is the greatest Grand Prix driver in the history

Dan  44:26
of the sport, right? It's nothing to me. liberals don't drive,

Jordan  44:29
Lewis Hamilton the best ever at driving the fastest.

Dan  44:35
They don't understand what it means to live the best at the fastest. Right. And I think that I mean, there's there's something that's being expressed by Alex here. And that is it seems to be that leftists don't drive fast cars because they don't want to experience the danger of driving fast. And the danger of driving fast is knowing that you could die right which is the only way to read li be alive, right?

Jordan  45:01
This is silly. That is insane. Yeah,

Dan  45:05
I think Alex just wanted to talk about cars a little bit, but many weaved it into politics. So it didn't seem like he was just bragging about his car. You can't just

Jordan  45:12
like, man, they just say they want to try and own just that. Anything that comes into their sphere,

Dan  45:19
right? Especially for Alex. It's anything that feels like vaguely masculine.

Jordan  45:23
Yeah, yeah. Which is like man driving fast is not masculine or feminine. It's a playing with a toy. Everybody likes playing with toys. It's playing with toys.

Dan  45:33
I don't particularly like driving much.

Jordan  45:35
No, but you like playing with your toys? You like you've got toys? Yeah, you got games? Yeah, you could drive fast in

Dan  45:42
a video game I could have. I don't like driving video games either. You're not really a driver. No, not really. You don't have a license? No, that's true. I haven't since I lived in Chicago. I was just such a bad driver. Yeah, I got bored really easily. Like, I don't think I have ADD, but like, when I was driving, it was so boring. Right? Right. Every now and again. I would hit the curb just because I'm like, and not like it's not like highway hypnosis or anything. You're just like, What is the point? I may I may end up having to get a license again. At some point.

Jordan  46:16
It'll be interesting. You do want to live in the middle of nowhere and without a without a car. That'd be tough. That'd be tougher.

Dan  46:22
Not if I got a drone. No, I was thinking more along the lines of You know in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, that giant cat that you write around who that's true. I get one of those. You could get

Jordan  46:34
one of those. That's true.

Dan  46:35
I don't think that needs a life.

Jordan  46:36
I have not. I have not accounted for writable felines in this in this scenario.

Dan  46:41
So Viewer discretion advised to this next clip, not because it's terrible or anything. It's just Alex is talking a little bit about sex. Oh, great. And this is a family show. Gross.

Alex Jones  46:51
You know, I'm not into bondage. I'm going into pain. And a few times, thanks for telling us high school and college and I will get this incredible date. incredible woman. And they would want me to slap him around. And I'd say no. And they say you're a wimp. Screw you get out of here, that at least twice. I'm like, I'm sorry. I don't want to slap you around. I don't want to punch you in the face. I don't want to beat you with a bullet. But that's a masochist. Or a sadomasochists I guess wants to cause pain. The point is I'm on into pain, baby.

Dan  47:25
I think I just kept it in because I'm not in pain, baby. Good to know.

Jordan  47:30
Is that what we say? For the I think that save that. That's our COVID Conspiracy of the day. I'm not into pain, baby.

Dan  47:37
Well, I think I think that Alex is also mixing up a fair amount of BDSM here in terms of, you know, obviously there are some people who like a little bit of rough stuff, but it's not the entirety of of bondage. Yeah, no, I mean, I don't think he has a full understanding of this, but it might end I'm not sure that I believe his childhood stories of how

Jordan  48:01
now my biggest barrier is just I'm terrible with knots. I'm terrible with knots. I tried to watch a video one time I was asked about I was asked about how to tie some good knots for the stuff you know the type sure not good at it real bad. Got out. Yeah, that's that's a real disappointing hostage situation one which is a fantasy. And you still let the hostage get away? Well, one time

Dan  48:24
one time I had I had a young lady who wanted me to bring some knots into the bedroom and I brought Don Knotts. Big mistake. She left me for it. For those of you who aren't here George's taking off his headphones slowly.

Jordan  48:45
I do appreciate that 700 episode, it took 700 episodes for me to really want to quit.

Dan  48:56
But for slightly different reasons. Yes. Yeah. So Alex has a story. And we heard this tale of a football player who had a lot of blood clots last episode, right. And now Alex has a story about someone having a heart attack. Oh no.

Alex Jones  49:11
We have 10s of 1000s of percent increase in young people having heart attacks never used to happen. It's everywhere. Because it fries your heart. The next time you speed that sucker up. It's byebye. So this is the tree of death is what we're talking about here. Just tree here's the clip. Bartlett teen shoppers heart attack after finishing cross country race WR eg here it is. A 17 year

News Anchor 1 (726)  49:46
old Bartlett High school cross country runner is recovering and Florida after undergoing emergency heart surgery. Gabe Higginbottom had just completed a race Saturday in Pensacola when he started complaining of chest pains

News Anchor 2 (726)  49:58
as WGS one Listen mode reports he underwent a three hour surgery and now teammates, coaches and the community are praying for his swift return to health.

Dan  50:08
I consulted tons of news stories about this case, and none of them say he'd gotten vaccinated. That's just an assumption that Alex is making, which you may notice as a trend. He's reporting and hyping up instances of young people having medical conditions, but never actually does the work to connect them to the vaccine at all. That connection is already made in the minds of his listener. So it's kind of a waste of time to worry about actually demonstrating it. It seems like this never happens or can't happen. But high school athletes can have heart attacks, just do a little digging into the subject. And you can find instances pre COVID really easily. In fact, in 2011, Denver Public Schools began installing portable defibrillator is that schools because, quote, sudden cardiac arrest kills an estimated 300,000 Americans every year, including about 7000 children. Yeah, Alex's exploiting his audiences understandable feeling that young people shouldn't have heart attacks, and then weaponizing that for his anti Vax agenda, it's disgusting. And ultimately, he's using the deaths and medical emergencies of these young people as props for him to use to accumulate power and profit. Sort of like how Ron DeSantis is using,

Jordan  51:14
oh, he's Wait, you're connecting these two things?

Dan  51:17
Well, there's the magic similarity. I

Jordan  51:18
can see that. But yeah, Alex

Dan  51:20
just assumes he never does any of the work that you need to do to actually report a story. He's just guessing shit.

Alex Jones  51:25
But notice the adults all have Stockholm Syndrome. We're just looking for something weird. We don't know what caused this. Well, we know what caused it. You bet your bottom dollar he took the Pfizer moderna j&j shot.

Alex Jones  51:40
And so any of them are all stung by a

Alex Jones  51:43
particular bee, or a particular bug, and then you got sick, you know the bug, get it? I don't need to be an ornithologist. To know what a bird is. I don't need to be an expert in insects. I think you do need to know why the Black Widow bites me I can have a big rod hole in my body that could kill me. But rattlesnake bites me. I know my legs swell up because the rattlesnake bite it's the shots.

Dan  52:05
So this thinking is just stupid. And assuming that you know and can just guess causal relations between things without knowing more about the variables that's painfully dumb. Like, for instance, what if you get bit by two things which caused the reaction you're seeing? No, no, no, no. What if you're variable and complicating this also, you can clearly see here that Alex is just guessing that the runner in this case got the vaccine. Even if he had Alex can't prove or demonstrate any causal link. But Alex can't even prove that the thing he's claiming cause this effect even happened. He's seeing an effect that he knows he can exploit. So he's decided what the cause is based on no information. This isn't a story that's going to be followed up on so if you're in the audience, you'll just experience the story as a dopamine rush of Alex proving your anti Vax ideas correct? Then you'll move on never even worrying about whether or not you're just the target of a parlor trick. But he's just questioning that it's really I mean, what do you think about it Alex? All he does is question things not make things up.

Jordan  53:06
A he really is a cult leader in this respect, because you could absolutely see him like with his his loyal info warriors walking down the street and pass by a guy with a broken arm and Alex and be like, Haha, it was a snake bike. And then they just keep walking today. Like yeah, that was a snake bite clearly. Yeah, it was a snake bite. Like there's nothing It doesn't matter if it even makes sense. Yeah, because that's what he's is description is like, Oh, well, if you get bit by a rattlesnake, then your leg does a thing then you know that it's a rattlesnake. Well, then you have to say that he got the vaccine and then the thing happened, right? This is like saying his legs wall up. Clearly it was a rattlesnake like, no, that doesn't mean haven't even proven that there is a rat. We're not in that state male have we don't have a rattlesnake to react to smoking rattlesnake in this situation.

Dan  53:56
Yeah. Yeah. So third hour is interviewing that Paul Alexander guy. don't really give a fuck Nope. So we're gonna jump to the 16th. Friday show. Woof, woof. No Man's Land, no man's land. Nothing happened. Oh,

Alex Jones  54:10
let's put the live show headline on screen place. This is an emergency broadcast. Nothing happened. No Man's Land. Emergency is deepening and it's accelerating. And there's not much time even mitigate how bad this crash is going to get. So if you go to infowars.com You'll see the live show headline. And it says emergency Friday broadcast. And it deals with FedEx. And FedEx is seen as an absolutely key indicator. What's happening not just here but in the world economy. Now FedEx is telling the world what I've told you in the last month because I know people in industry, not just conservatives, not just nationalist, I know people in a lot of areas of infrastructure. And basically, the economy is flatlining when this has all been done, but done by design, as usual, here are some of the headlines. Massive FedEx shares plunge, the Dow Jones every other indices way down right now, that x shares plunge by 70% After company says it's going to get worse. We're going into a worldwide recession, FedEx CEO warns, numbers don't pretend very well.

Dan  55:47
So there's some serious concerns with FedEx announcing that they're seeing a decrease in shipping both domestically and internationally. This could be a negative indicator for the economy in the future. But there's also a ton of other variables that play into this. One that's pointed to pretty frequently is that the Asian economy is weakening, and that impact is shown in reduced freight. Another variable is that people are starting to shop in person more now that most people are acting like COVID is over, that has the effect of reducing shipping to previously normal rates, which are lower than they have been over the course of the pandemic. Thirdly, Amazon has made moves into the logistics and transportation, transportation space in the past few years. And that has had the effect of reducing FedEx as overall market share. All that being said FedEx was down about 22%, which definitely isn't a good sign. However, if you look back at their stock price, over time, they're trading at about $161 A share as I was preparing this episode, in March 2020, they were at $106.63 A share before making a huge jump as the pandemic lead to more people ordering things for more delivery, right. And there were people ordering things that may be needed to be delivered immediately, you know, more tight timeframes, which does have an effect as that demand goes down, you still need to offer that delivery in that window that you're offering, right? Which leads to like, instead of a plane being 100%, full, you have to send it with like, half full, or whatever, that has a big impact. Yep, this may be a bad indicator of things to come. But it may not be a cause for an emergency episode and the theatrics that Alex is putting into this. That said, he does this all the time about everything. And it's always the summer of rage coming. And I'm not surprised at all. Yeah. But yeah, you know, there may be economic issues. Like you know, there may be some difficulties, FedEx might be in some trouble. But whatever it is, has nothing to do with is no connection to anything. Alex is saying.

Jordan  57:46
Yeah, I mean, we live in America, if you look at us, historically, the fact that they don't regulate we don't regulate the finance industry whatsoever, has essentially led to a series of crashes that happen every decade to two decades. Happens every fucking time. Where do it's coming? Oh, boy. Yeah. Great Prophet.

Dan  58:07
So what supremacy I don't know if you've heard of it. vaguely, not really real.

Alex Jones  58:13
Meanwhile, FBI agent, we have more people assigned to investigate white supremacist than there are actual white supremacist in the United States. It's almost non existent. That's all coming up. I mean, this show huge because they're doing all this. Whatever it is, they're about stage, trying to outlaw their political opposition. That's part of what we're hitting. next hour. And listen, I'm just gonna say this now. It's a real opportunity for everybody on so many fronts. Supporting this broadcast is an incredible opportunity. Because you look at the incredible work we've done together, it's changed the world. And when you find this place, you're just as important as I am. Plus, you get incredible products. So I'm not going to belabor this. I'm not going to let you complain. A lot of our products have finally come back into stock. We put everything we had into buying these products to get them in. And then FedEx comes out and tells you what I told you a month ago. The real economy is flatlining. So I know people running the money. I know the economy's dead. I know they're a great reset of their lockdowns was designed to trigger this, but you must absolutely look in your life and decide what is most critical.

Dan  59:23
What a generous person Alex is giving the audience an opportunity to give him money. Yeah, that's the kind of selfless character you rarely see these days just going out of his way and being like, Hey, I know you're hurting. But it's important to still give me money.

Jordan  59:38
I need money. What an

Dan  59:41
opportunity for you.

Jordan  59:42
I just I just don't man, if you actually I mean, if you really believe that people are struggling, and you ask them for money after you agree with that. That's crazy to me. That's bananas down to me to look at somebody who's struggling more than me and then be like But you should give me money. That's crazy. Because

Dan  1:00:03
whatever I'm doing my project is more important than your well being.

Jordan  1:00:07
No, I would give you money. That's just I don't understand how you're struggling and I'm not so then I help you not struggle. Let's it's

Dan  1:00:16
not complicated. That's because he's a good guy you just don't understand. Dammit. So Alex plays a long bit of Josh Hawley interviewing someone from Facebook, and

Jordan  1:00:27
just just someone from Facebook, from the company. Yeah, okay. Okay. Not just like somebody. Okay.

Dan  1:00:34
And, look, it's long and boring. And I think this sort of highlights how boring it is because Alex asked to start yelling.

Facebook Employee  1:00:42
We do know that people expected and hoped from the platforms that we would help them get accurate information about COVID During the unprecedented time, especially at the beginning.

Josh Hawley  1:00:52
Well, isn't there a difference between you as a platform putting forward information and censoring your users at the behest of the White House? The administration more broadly in the CDC? Isn't there a distinction there?

Facebook Employee  1:01:06
We specifically wanted to work with public health experts to understand the relationship between information and behavior. And so we did consult so

Alex Jones  1:01:15
you were directed by the help or you were directed by them to understand how collusion criminal policies we

Josh Hawley  1:01:22
will you didn't just do didn't just consult with them to understand how they affected public health you actually censored on their behalf in order.

Dan  1:01:31
Yeah, he's he can't It's whatever. Yeah, like Yeah, but that's just to indicate there's a long stretch of that being the coverage and Alex himself can't even keep it together to just watch it. Now. He's not he's not cut out for I would say, like analysis of dents are like more boring writings, right? He likes publicity stunts. Yes. You know, that's kind of his bread and butter. Yeah, memes.

Jordan  1:01:57
I think it would be fun. If you had if I was running Infowars I would have a little meter. That is like Alex's tolerance meter that would end it would like have a little graphic where his head would start to pop, because that's what it feels like when he's watching that there's

Dan  1:02:11
just a meter going up. Chaotic meter.

Jordan  1:02:15
is harder than the applause meter that's

Dan  1:02:17
add influences and you don't know what they're gonna do. Like you put Brian Stelter is face on screen, it just automatically blows up with them. For some reason you bring a llama in studio and everything's fine.

Jordan  1:02:29
It's just fine. He's not mad about it. Yeah. I would be more frustrated with the llama in studio, but what are you gonna do? Well, because it's my apartment. Yeah, that

Dan  1:02:36
is an issue for you. Although I do like llamas and not in my apartment. No, we have some big news. Was that something that's not true?

Alex Jones  1:02:51
Five weeks ago, they swore in Klaus Schwab as the head of the UN and said he has full command say once.

Dan  1:02:59
Yeah. Klaus Schwab was sworn in as the head of

Jordan  1:03:03
why did they do that? They didn't. Don't they have to have like old thing.

Dan  1:03:09
Alex is just questioning. You understand? The secret. So

Jordan  1:03:13
did he get sworn in and secret? Why would you have any swearing in ceremony if you can do it in secret?

Dan  1:03:22
I don't know. I didn't happen. Yeah, that's

Jordan  1:03:26
that's an issue.

Dan  1:03:27
I honestly was looking around. I can't even figure out what he might be referring to this recording. I don't know. I have no idea. But yeah, Klaus Rob isn't the head of the UN.

Jordan  1:03:36
I would think what, where, where, when and why

Dan  1:03:40
he doesn't explain how he doesn't explain. Bullshit. Okay. So look, Alex likes to talk about memes and stuff. And he saw He saw his video on social media that he got a report on.

Alex Jones  1:03:51
I want to play an imam here. So I'm not against Muslims in general. That's not true. I'm here. Where he talks about tick tock. And this is true. Now Tick, tock, owned and run by the Communist Chinese puts out destroying messages to kill the family and to kill our minds and our future. But then the very same algorithm in China puts out a different message of stoic strength and will and mathematics and military and as mathematics. So while they're building men and women and families, their shadow tising us with Hollywood and big tech, and all of this in the messages are all there to make you get up and roll over to die.

Dan  1:04:42
They found the video that Alex is referring to but I don't know who the person is who's talking and I have no idea if they're even an Imam, or any Yeah, it's just someone who kind of looks like they're in the attire you might think and a mom would be in but outside of that there's no indication about his identity at all. I found the person was new originally posted this on Twitter, but there's no citation to who this person is. And no one in the comments identifies him either it's baffling. I have no idea who the person is and larger point, neither does Alex. He just saw a random video on social media that made a point that he liked about tick tock, so he's reporting on it. It's his process. That's what he's doing. Yeah, even leaving the anonymity of the speaker aside, who cares about this claim? It's not backed up by any data that this guy is presenting. It's just the thing that someone's saying someone who have no idea who they are or the larger context of their comments. Essentially, what I'm saying here is that I don't really care about this video. The only important thing to point out is that Alex has no idea who this person is. There's nothing backing up what they're saying. Yeah. And he's, he loves it.

Jordan  1:05:45
It's Alex's broadcast has become an audio version of your uncle's Facebook page in 2015. Like it is just a series.

Dan  1:05:54
hateful, maybe. depends on

Jordan  1:05:57
whose uncle Yeah, we gotta be talking uncles. But yeah, I mean, it is just like a bunch of, I saw this, and now I'm mad, and then you just move on. And then you like, have a flame war in the comments for a while. And then the next day, you're like, I saw that it's fucking awful.

Dan  1:06:12
Right? And like, there is just like, the, like, the way that social media makes things like, what's the next post? Yeah, Alex says the same, like, the next show. Yeah, it's almost like a new cycle or refreshed all those things that I said yesterday, don't matter. And when I

Jordan  1:06:29
got this is the amount of likes that I got. This is about what I'm gonna get from here. So I gotta move on. Yeah, it's a whole mess.

Dan  1:06:35
So I'm still talking a little bit about Martha's Vineyard here. Sure. Fellowship crime.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:41
So what are the most difficult challenges? The difficult challenges are?

Alex Jones  1:06:47
Again, I'll start this over sorry. Again, this is one of the leaders in Martha's Vineyard, the leader is saying we don't have places for him. We don't have jobs for him. Don't bring him here. But you're telling him come here. And they voted 85% in Martha's Vineyard for Joe Biden. So if you want to pour gasoline on yourself, and I don't know, fire lady don't do it. There's nothing like a leftist to be disconnected from reality. Sorry, started over. So what

Unknown Speaker  1:07:13
are the most critical challenges right now? The difficult challenges are we have, at some point in time, they have to move somewhere else, right? We cannot we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants. And we certainly don't have housing, we're in a housing crisis as we are on this island. And we don't, we can't How's everyone here that lives here and work here. We don't have housing for 50 more people.

Dan  1:07:42
So Alex is presenting this as one of the leaders for Martha's Vineyard, because he has no idea who this person is. And he is not entirely sure if Martha's Vineyard is a city or what he should call their leaders. In reality, this is Lisa Bell Castro, the coordinator of the homeless shelter in Martha's Vineyard. And when she says that, eventually people need to leave. She's talking about how the shelter she works with isn't designed for providing long term help. When you understand that what she's talking about is the services her shelter can provide. Not like the city, she's not speaking for the city, right or for Martha's Vineyard as a whole like it's, he's he's deceiving with the context. Yeah. So the larger context of that clip it Alex isn't playing. It's about how the community has come together to help these migrants. And then Lisa goes off on DeSantis about how this is a disgraceful political stunt. That's essentially an attack on the personhood of these migrants themselves. Conveniently cuts that off just before Yeah, yeah, I mean, for that,

Jordan  1:08:38
there's, there's no other way to describe it than to say that he has taken these people and reduce them to things.

Dan  1:08:45
Yeah, yeah. That's Alex. Alexandra. Them too. Yep. So here's a clip of DeSantis just as a like, sort of reverse of this.

Ron DeSantis  1:08:54
And all those people in DC in New York, were beating their chests when Trump was president saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions saying how bad it was to have a secure border, the minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden, go berserk and they're so upset that this is happening. And it just shows you you know, their virtue signaling is a fraud. Okay? They.

Dan  1:09:26
So we can't survive as a country if this is what elected leaders do. The fabric of the country just won't hold together if we have trolls using humans for publicity stunts in a weird attempt to trigger the LIBS so you will reveal their virtue signal insane even if everything DeSantis was saying was true. This is how a distasteful prank show operates not a governor. Beyond that. What he's saying is bullshit. People are upset about migrants and refugees going to different cities. They were super offended by the way DeSantis is doing this as a political stunt using the safety of migrants as a prop. He's endangering you Humans, including children, for his own purposes, largely to increase the chances that he's able to increase his political power in the future. He knows well enough that he can't acknowledge that this is what he's getting pushback for. Because it's a very sensible push back that he can't just write off as triggered virtue signal responses. So we pretend to that's what people are upset about. Just pleases the, the aggressive audience

Jordan  1:10:23
I mean, that I you can't hear him talk like that without getting an immediate urge to like bum rush the stage and just start slapping in the you can't believe this. Just slapping wake up something is wake up. Like there's that's that's an unsaid that's not possible for a human being to think is true. In any meaningful form.

Dan  1:10:48
You're a person who has the responsibility for representing a fucking state. You're the governor of a state. This is beneath your station. Yeah. Business beneath your office. Yeah. And I think a lot of things that maybe elected officials do or maybe beneath the office, but particularly this is up there. Yeah. And I think that acting this way, too. And then the response being like, Oh, look at this virtue signaling it reveals it like that, to me is like, this is Social Media trolling

Jordan  1:11:22
just isn't this isn't just do what other Florida governor's do and get rich off of your shit, and then leave. That's what is that's what Florida does. Yeah, just be a corrupt piece of shit like Florida likes. That's what they want. God dammit.

Dan  1:11:39
So the third hour of Alex's show on Friday, he has a couple of doctors on who are suing about remdesivir. But they're clearly on a fishing expedition. They're making outrageous claims about hospitals murdering for profit, but there's no evidence of anything that's going to be tough. And then they keep saying we hope we'll find things in discovery. Like it's zero in terms of like an interview. It is a nothing but very exciting for us. We'll

Jordan  1:12:04
find things in discovery. Yeah, we'll

Dan  1:12:06
go from there.

Jordan  1:12:06
Ah, see, now this is how the legal system works. I say I sue you and then you have to give me all of the information that I need to sue you.

Dan  1:12:16
I make bold claims that are baseless, and then the law makes it so they're true. So we have one last clip, and it's about the lineage of these sorts of publicity stunts. And Alan Nazis. Well, Alex actually has a pretty good point.

Alex Jones  1:12:32
Not sure if it's good enough for the Democratic strongholds have giant head cities. How about they start to happen at their houses. There's one from Despicable Me. He says sorry, illegal migrants. Southern border states are full. But I hear Martha's Vineyard is accepting reservations. I mean, actually, Laura Loomer is idea three years ago, he took a bunch of illegal aliens. She picked up on the Texas border, excuse me California border and took them to Nancy Pelosi house and she got arrested for it. Let's get Laura Loomer on Sunday.

Dan  1:13:07
Oh, very exciting about this book and can't wait for her to say that she won the election secretly. So Alex is lying about what Laura Loomer did. She picked up men she assumed or undocumented immigrants from a Home Depot parking lot and convinced them to accompany her to set up a tent in Pelosi his backyard. But it's pretty unlikely that they told that she told them that they'd be trespassing on Pelosi his property to do so. And then, you know, she didn't almost certainly didn't tell them as part of a publicity stunt aimed at boosting her profile. With the ultimate goal of being to accumulate political power that she could wield against immigrants.

Jordan  1:13:41
It would be a very difficult thing to explain in the Home Depot parking lot and do so successfully. Yeah,

Dan  1:13:48
it was pretty clear that the real aim of the stunt was to do this illegal thing trespassing in order to create a confrontation between the police and the immigrants. This would allow Loomer to do exactly what the scientist is doing now with the oh you want immigrants here, but apparently not on your property kind of game. Unfortunately, Pelosi didn't press charges against anyone so the immigrants just left and according to will summer at The Daily Beast quote, when it became clear that the men wouldn't be arrested and deported as was apparently the plan. One of BLOOMERS associates groaned and shouted catch and release at them. The police. Loomer didn't get arrested for this stunt. But again, you can see this need to use fraud to try and set people up and an eagerness to use people as pawns and politically cruel stunts. That's Alex's ideology. And this shit is totally fine to him because they aren't people to him. These these people are things Yeah, you have to use fraud objects,

Jordan  1:14:42
you have to use fraud because you are complaining about people that don't exist. So then you have to because they're not going to do what it is you're complaining about. Then you have to try and create a contraption of sorts to get them into a situation where maybe what but they do could be construed from a distance as what you have been complaining about this whole time. Don't

Dan  1:15:05
Don't besmirch contraption.

Jordan  1:15:07
I'm not just saying that I'm trying to use the more technical term you know, I It's like it's like a chain reaction with tissue paper you know, I'm using

Dan  1:15:19
Yeah, it's I think there is like a you know, it's weird when Alex is able to make connections, you know, like that Laura Loomer stuff is similar to it is in many ways. Yeah. And he if he would sit and think about that for a little while, maybe maybe he No, he wouldn't. He wouldn't learn anything

Jordan  1:15:42
if I was DeSantis. I would sit and think about that a while and go Am I really going to do Loomer shit? Oh, yeah, that's what I would do. Yeah, I'm

Dan  1:15:50
like, I'm a Loomer hack.

Jordan  1:15:51
Because Because and that's and that's not because in my in my inhabiting of this character, it's not morally that bloomers doing immoral things. It's that she's shit at the job. You know?

Dan  1:16:06
It's just garbage. Yeah. formance Oh,

Jordan  1:16:08
yeah. Shit. Yeah, get better. Do something better steal from us steal from somebody better. You know, like Marcel Duchamp put an upside down urinal in Martha's Vineyard. How about that? Blow everybody's mind. It'd be interesting.

Dan  1:16:22
It would be but you know what the liberals would like they would like be confused by challenge. Yeah,

Jordan  1:16:29
it would get its own it will get its own Facebook page in like an instant everybody would be wearing shirts. It'd be gritty. And then the upside down urinal of Martin Martha's Vineyard. That's the way it would go. Yeah.

Dan  1:16:41
So I mean, look, there's not much going on here. As Alex's trial progresses, where we left off on Friday, the end of pauses, testimony, right. Norm was trying desperately to bring Trump into the proceedings, and got slapped down with that a number of time hilariously and yeah, I don't know. I don't think that I don't know whether any big points that you would want to bring up. You've you've seen over the course of the week.

Jordan  1:17:12
I mean, I suppose the big point for me is just been so much is is clear, especially with the elongated trial now is so much of it is so obvious that the judge, and Norman and Maddie and all of those people have the rules set up. And the rules are norm cannot do everything that norm is doing. Yeah, but because it's a trial. And we can't just sit there and have the judge say norm, sit back down. You are not allowed to

Alex Jones  1:17:44
talk, although she has said

Dan  1:17:45
that a couple has said that a couple of times. I will make you sit down.

Jordan  1:17:50
Yes, absolutely. She's had to say that. And she's going to keep saying that. Because that's their entire that's all they've got is the stuff they can't say. Yeah, they don't have a new argument. So they're just gonna try and do different ways to like backdoor the same shit. They're not allowed to say it. And we're gonna watch it for more weeks dip. Yeah,

Dan  1:18:10
yeah, yeah. So we'll give you an update on that. As

Jordan  1:18:15
long as the rules are broken more,

Dan  1:18:16
and it appears that Alex is gonna be there probably testifying next week or this week as Yeah, as things are going. Yeah, that'll be we'll see. I'll be interesting. Sure. We'll Yeah. But yeah, we'll be back for another episode in the near future. We will but until then Jordan wave website.

Jordan  1:18:33
Indeed. We do acknowledge fight.com. Yep. We're also on Twitter. We are on Twitter. It's at knowledge underscore fight.
