00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Go to the round drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Is there a hook to the b*******

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
Automatic classic Vines

6
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
I don't know

7
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
Front of the show

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,896
People seem to enjoy its

9
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,480
I don't know what's fun about that

10
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,576
I know it's fun for me but

11
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,696
Look out for a couple of portmanteau is coming later we'll see if that happens

12
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
Theater near you

13
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,608
So I would like to give a shout out to a new donor what's going on out there Rebecca

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Thank you so much

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
Rose Rushmore for anybody who likes the thrilling adventure hour

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
If you like to be a much like Rebecca you can do so by

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Accordingly

18
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
It does support the show we really appreciate it

19
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Cuz you know

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
This is why we're Where We Are

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Appreciate because Dan couldn't survive without it let Ruth

22
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Hayward probably a honey

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Maybe a hundred

24
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
$150 a month away for like

25
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Legitimate comfort

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Or like

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Survival level

28
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,280
I'd like to get there without having to sell out

29
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Any further down this stock

30
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
Cancel Jordan wants to kill white people

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,808
Search Jordan today we are

32
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
I imagine being as we are insects

33
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,048
Client

34
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah the only reason we would be spotted like

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,496
We would accept spaces a sponsor but only if they just gave us free

36
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
It's got to be a piece of it you got to get a little bit of taste like

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
Is that all you get

38
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
Whichever one probably gases that we would

39
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Baby going over at Matty's

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Tuesday

41
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Alex Jones

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Did he

43
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Press conference

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,840
From Washington d.c. to the swap to confront these

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Got to do it

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,216
Spoiler alert

47
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Disaster

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Good disaster like not a fun

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Entertaining disaster it was just

50
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,456
The press conference was the equivalent of a comic

51
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
You can't get on Comedy Central

52
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Can't get book

53
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
So they booked out a small theater make their own special

54
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
It's basically like no one wants you

55
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
No one wants you

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
But make it look like they do

57
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,840
So he rents a room in the National Press Club and then just does his normal bit

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
She doesn't like

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Let me

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Say on it

61
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
A couple clips of that

62
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
Something that is way more important

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
The cross here

64
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
Clips of the actual press conference

65
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Coverage of the rest of the press conference

66
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
Or go look at rightwingwatch

67
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
They covered the

68
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,751
Standard stop

69
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
You wouldn't pick up on necessarily unless you knew

70
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
Too much which I do

71
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,991
Here's the first thing in this is the sort of an out-of-context drive but I can visit the most offensive thing

72
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
That

73
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Resizing the entire Prescott

74
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
F*** you telling us to bring it

75
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,407
Brinks market share this almost

76
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
Do they have like two guys working on it

77
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
No like

78
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,951
We're never going to compete on that front

79
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
Office gets exploded by a meteor in case

80
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
Let's stay around on the off-chance

81
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Story that you see on that the headlines about his press conference

82
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
He went over and growth of the American

83
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Can flag

84
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
That is because someone asked him about his connection

85
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319
Americana

86
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
And he goes over and starts kissing

87
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
It was okay but it was just lectionary according to the uniform code

88
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
I believe a violation

89
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Like a prosecutable

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Touch the ground

91
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,895
Kneeling during the national anthem is of course the worst thing that

92
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
And they should never be given a job sir

93
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:20,159
Essentially f****** a flag that's all whatsoever except

94
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
The guy was trying to

95
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,559
A very legitimate question that is like Alex you have been appearing on Russian television you have your

96
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
You keep reposting without permission stories for Marty all of your narrative seem to be Putin

97
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
Apologetic narrative Rogers down your story doesn't really

98
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Really make sense

99
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
Lee Stranahan this other guy who's there you literally work for Sputnik

100
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
You like you have to understand why people are asking question

101
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
Start screaming

102
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Tiny flag

103
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
And I over at that song

104
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
Dry cleaners

105
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
I have a theory

106
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
I think that the press conference that he did was mostly

107
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Desperation move cuz

108
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
He doesn't say anything he doesn't say normally

109
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,551
He was wanted to make a big splash out of it but I wasn't

110
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Suing him

111
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,671
I think that's I think that might have been one of the lead objectives of him going

112
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Do this press conference

113
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
And in this clip

114
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
He's just head

115
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
Lee Ann McAdoo come up

116
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
For a little while

117
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
And she does this like

118
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
I'm afraid of public reopening was the opening comics

119
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
Murderers Row of losers

120
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
What's going on

121
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Press conference

122
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Was Jack Purcell

123
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,647
It was Lee Ann McAdoo Millie Weaver

124
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999
Jerome corsi

125
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
You had Jerome corsi Hadley at least ranahan

126
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
You had that

127
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,543
Do the Cardinals announcer

128
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Everyone was drunk

129
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Spoiler alert

130
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Pictures of movie star right

131
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
You have

132
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Do you have the end McAdoo up there I don't know if she's actually afraid of public speaking or anything like that none of her behavior

133
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Run the show order

134
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
Live reports where she goes out and talks people on the street

135
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Indicate that she has a fear of public

136
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
I don't know I'm afraid of addressing crowds but I'm here

137
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
And I think there's a little bit of it that's trying to make a feeble victim out of her and Alex

138
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
And then if anybody attacks her that it turns into like

139
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
Which is exactly where the eclipse start

140
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,535
How do I do that

141
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
This is Lily.

142
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Also really really sorry about this deep sound is terrible and it's because none of them

143
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Have Mike technique

144
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
We're going to be some stuff that's a little bit lower than you wanted

145
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Tubi

146
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Daffodil

147
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Alright

148
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
The camera

149
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Blink twice

150
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Sentiment

151
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
That's a lie versus actual

152
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Make it all up

153
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
We got it

154
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
Brake table

155
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,479
Call Jessie George Soros

156
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Sarcastic

157
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
I'm telling you he's a superhero

158
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
Voice

159
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Quantum

160
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Soros

161
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
You are a hero that killed Hitler

162
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Anderson Cooper

163
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
Turn into werewolves

164
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
How about off Hitler

165
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Great movie

166
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Like there's no part of this that is like

167
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
You would expect professionalism

168
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
And to be fair he does have his lawyer speak for a little while

169
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
It's sort of profession

170
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Alex Jones lawyer none of this is admissible

171
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,623
I do not want anyone to know what it happen

172
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
Don't snitch advise my client not doing this adventure

173
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
I will advise him

174
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
Not to have switch is not possible Lord knows the media is not covering this

175
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,775
I think I can cover this

176
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
They're not going to because it's clearly stupid

177
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:05,247
The horribly offensive bulshit that you say

178
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm even better not really because most of the articles are about him groping the flag

179
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Like that

180
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
Which is to get reasonably inocuas compared to what we're going to be talking about

181
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
After we discuss

182
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
The

183
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
The Prescott

184
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Is that we have

185
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,423
Cuz it's way more important and no one

186
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Has been talkin about that

187
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
We just really whatever one

188
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
I'm should be talkin about

189
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Before we get to that

190
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Hi we are getting

191
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Appearance of Rodger Stone

192
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Alex

193
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
Rodger Stone should have left the country by now

194
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,599
He's there

195
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
He's standing up and fighting

196
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
He's going to be there he's going to

197
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,815
You f****** a deal already

198
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,519
Ric Flair of Infowars

199
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
Like he's a political dirty so like of course he's like

200
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
I know what I did

201
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
I know what they can find out I did

202
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit

203
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,135
Detection and that's why he's acting like he hasn't gotten that deal

204
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
I don't know at least some of the interviews where is like

205
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,655
Alt-right credibility

206
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,031
Also I think it's what we talked about all the time

207
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
Cuz he also wants to f*** with people

208
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,759
Perfectly with what we know because otherwise

209
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
He's in Washington DC for the

210
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Suppress

211
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Hey what think I think is really awesome is it Alex's so distracted that he doesn't realize that he brings up Rodger Stone twice

212
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
He's brain breaks

213
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
Bring them back up well after like two other speakers or so

214
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
About this guy

215
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
He gets up there and he does a bit

216
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Tattoo on my

217
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Which is a daily reminder

218
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Things don't go your way

219
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
The only person you know

220
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:48,575
Couple laps

221
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
One of them

222
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
Alex really loud and the friend who's there along at the show

223
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Hey you got

224
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
You got it without you still got it

225
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,687
And that f****** joke

226
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,575
He has the same joke like a million times

227
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,903
And also

228
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,511
Like we were talking about Andrew Breitbart episode about Larry Sinclair

229
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
The guy who claimed to have blown Obama in the back of the limo after doing crack cocaine with right

230
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
The Press Club press conference

231
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,967
The accusations or whatever his lawyer if you'll recall

232
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Was wearing a kilt

233
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
And you know his lawyer

234
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
We're fine for some people who don't

235
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Large dick

236
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
In the Press Club during a proud

237
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
I'm kind of a fan of that

238
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
It's

239
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Rogers moment

240
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Like that that's your press conference sucks

241
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,111
It's almost it's almost like a comedy magician

242
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,999
We're going to throw all these sleight-of-hand techniques at

243
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,119
Adicto good every now and again you're going to forget that I'm shity at both right you'll be surprised

244
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,871
So this next clip is a question from someone in the army

245
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,711
In the audience asking question

246
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
And I don't think you'll understand what he's talking about

247
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Most people dead

248
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
But I do

249
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Cuz I'm crazy

250
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
An expert

251
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
If you're down my show

252
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Crowdsourcing

253
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
On YouTube

254
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Any presented

255
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
He presented a document that was given to him

256
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Contact

257
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Department of Homeland

258
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Security

259
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
The indicator

260
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Was applied for

261
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
For the March for our lives

262
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Prior

263
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
To the shooting

264
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
And he said

265
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
The indicator

266
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Something

267
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
The difference

268
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
We've been talk

269
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Video received an anonymous strike

270
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
People who think they've got First Amendment right

271
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,911
As Anonymous avatars on the internet we don't even know if that's a person

272
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Dexter being artificial

273
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Intelligent

274
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Maybe someone operating out of a country

275
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
It is not protected

276
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,431
Institution of the United States United States

277
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
The face my accuser

278
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
And know what I mean

279
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
So that's powerful information

280
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Alex knows that name

281
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
It's a plug relay

282
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Mcgard

283
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
Because he holds the acts of Damascus

284
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
He's a frequent guest on Project Camelot

285
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Love it

286
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Love it

287
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
Kerry Cassidy false flag guy I love it we haven't listened

288
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,839
Episodes that have him

289
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
Crazy Richard's episode

290
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Depressing

291
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Dumb just not fun and more like oh you're making up all this s*** you have sources who tell you all this nonsense

292
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
It's crazy

293
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
To me that this is a really interesting illustration

294
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Just how close

295
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Camelot world

296
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
And Alex Jones world really are

297
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
They are not that far apart you have a guy who is

298
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Interviewing

299
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
On his YouTube show

300
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Mom is from Europe somewhere

301
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
Denmark

302
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
I'm not entirely sure

303
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
He goes on all kinds

304
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Sounds like YouTube conspiracy shows

305
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
That are just like weird people with the webcam

306
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
Essentially us

307
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Not

308
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,863
But

309
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
A better tomorrow

310
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
Simcam that's not a good idea

311
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
I don't know man

312
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
I don't

313
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
I don't know what further point I have

314
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
On this other than

315
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
It's fascinating

316
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Tumi

317
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
Just be that name come up

318
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
I feel like

319
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Discovering this should

320
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
Be like oh my God

321
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Look at this look at the connection

322
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
But knowing

323
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Water when I was

324
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
Watching this

325
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Really

326
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Press would be like

327
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
Oh well Olay dammegard of course is the

328
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Because

329
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
What

330
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,023
What does Alex the only reason I'm interested

331
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Because Alex called it

332
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Powerful in

333
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Also Hoosick

334
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,423
Crowdsource the truth is what this guy is from

335
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Is that YouTube show

336
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
Alex

337
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,407
And a lot of

338
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Because

339
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,343
There is a guy for right walk there

340
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,440
Super excited they are people like

341
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Mothers for Trump

342
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
A trump

343
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:25,120
Talk

344
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
I went to the mothers for Trump website and they have like a issues

345
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Button

346
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,592
Compressed and it links to Donald Trump donaldjtrump.com

347
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
Dot-com his position as interesting that if you click that link it says 404 page not found

348
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Inspiring

349
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
Mothers for Trump obviously don't really know how to use

350
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
Let's be honest

351
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,304
Automatically

352
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
This is the end of what I want to talk about in terms of Prescott

353
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
It's just

354
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
It's just nothing

355
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
Do they redo it

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Wait what

357
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
So Alex

358
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
And he's sort of just it's not a variant

359
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Interesting show but immediately after the show

360
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:18,368
He did a free-for-all question-and-answer thing at the Marriott Mayweather Hotel

361
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
The ballroom to save the Marriott nose like that sounds right

362
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,936
They basically just redid the press conference where they just had

363
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
Minus Lee Ann McAdoo come up and give slightly different speeches

364
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
And it's important to notice

365
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
What the differences are

366
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
They know that it's a place

367
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
How many watchful eyes

368
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
Fair in front of a friendly audience

369
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,600
And so it turns into a

370
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,184
A white nationalist Nazi rally

371
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,048
I totally saw that coming

372
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
No one's talking about

373
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,704
Alex Jones had this big to channel

374
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
Did you go and listen to it there is

375
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Distance

376
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,104
Really troubling things that are being said by people

377
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
A couple of them even

378
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,016
Earlier we were in front of the press but now I know we're all friends

379
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Which is

380
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,440
Not great you want to hear any white person say ever know

381
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,328
There's never been a situation where I've heard at like after a show if some dude is like

382
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Hey let me tell you some

383
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
That automatically means you're about to hear erased

384
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Okay bro you're cool

385
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
We're on the same team

386
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
You want to hear me say the n-word a few times no

387
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
I'm getting I'm making a little bit of a

388
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,528
Declaration of

389
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Listen to

390
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
I stand by what I'm saying

391
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
But before we get to that

392
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,304
Here's three minutes of before the press conference

393
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
Eyewear Alex Jones

394
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
I think

395
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Fink's

396
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Jordan klepper is trying to get into the question-and-answer

397
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Session

398
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
It hasn't started yet

399
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
And Alex is clearly drunk

400
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Wait so he thinks

401
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
The outside

402
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Jordan klepper

403
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Fighting to get in them doors

404
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
He's talking to a guy

405
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
That is not on camera

406
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
Might be Jordan klepper

407
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
But I don't know that it is

408
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,304
She wants everyone to think that it is

409
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,400
Haha

410
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
I can't say one way or another

411
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
But this is Alex

412
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Very clearly drunk

413
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Talking to someone

414
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Who he does not want

415
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
On this question

416
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Chuck-E-Cheese

417
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:23,200
Chuck-E-Cheese rap

418
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
Chuck-E-Cheese

419
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Chuck-E-Cheese

420
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,136
That's not a good thing

421
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
Call Tess Cantrell

422
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
This goes on for like another form

423
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:59,712
Chuck-E-Cheese the rat over and over again

424
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Great that's a solid move

425
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
Has his traditional drunk thing

426
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Possibly

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Positive reinforcement is like

428
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
This going to last forever

429
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Time to work

430
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
The first time but that it does not work the second

431
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,104
So you might be asking why the f***

432
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,432
Screaming Chuck-E-Cheese the rat

433
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
Kind of weird thing to yell

434
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
A lot of that

435
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Chucky

436
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Chi-Chi's the earlier

437
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
I heard him say brains

438
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
Yeah that take your brain Force

439
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
Alright

440
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:50,912
Just going to plug Hotel Ballroom

441
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
A couple of these people do plugs

442
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
It's interesting

443
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
Teleprompter reader

444
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
Yes

445
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
And then later on

446
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
What is ostensibly Jordan klepper

447
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Says

448
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Allowed to

449
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Accuse anybody of anything I want

450
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Free speech

451
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
Sure does sound like Jordan

452
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
That's a very bad things

453
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Bad

454
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,824
Isn't he supposed to be

455
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,920
Supposed to come up with better

456
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
He would have sent Tim baltz

457
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,272
Or something like that you would have sent other people

458
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,088
Who was Alex doesn't know who they are

459
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Chuck-E-Cheese the red

460
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,488
Cuz I don't understand what that means

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,120
Radioactive

462
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,384
I'm so out finally about 5 or 6 minutes in

463
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Into this video that he posted finally

464
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Robbed it was like

465
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
This way

466
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Alex if you want to Mike

467
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
That's illegal

468
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864
Yeah that's that's copyright Michael Buffer is going to sue you

469
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Comedy Central

470
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Comedy Central roast

471
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Sad

472
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,536
I want to just before we get to this the premise to be clear

473
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
This as

474
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
Feel like to our question-and-answer session

475
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Not that

476
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
Anyway

477
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
There's no call

478
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
There's no no calls

479
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Ballroom

480
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
It's respectable but

481
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
Based on his pretenses about his audience you would think

482
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
The room would be over swelling it's not

483
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
You would hope it's very it's very

484
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Modest

485
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
And in turn out

486
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
And

487
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Like I said

488
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
He just redoes the

489
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
The press conference

490
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,192
He just had all the same people come and give speeches

491
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
I meant at the end gets

492
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
2 some questions

493
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
And it's unfortunate does

494
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Cuz one of these questions

495
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Gets asked

496
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
Is one of the most crazy things I've ever heard

497
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
On Infowars

498
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
What is a big

499
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
Big pronounce

500
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
It will blow your mind

501
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,344
Okay it will absolutely

502
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,928
But we have to go through a little bit of bulshit to get there

503
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Here's Chuck-E-Cheese rat

504
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
Chuck-E-Cheese the rat bastard

505
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
Chuck-E-Cheese the rat which will be his new meme

506
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
What is known as

507
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
50 years from now

508
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
When he goes on to Valhalla

509
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
What is that was not a big

510
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,512
What is a globalist rat book

511
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Like

512
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
Jews

513
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Chuck-E-Cheese the rap

514
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,640
Robots when you're home

515
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Anyways I'm sorry

516
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:24,832
Solid

517
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Inside that is

518
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
If

519
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Globalism is what you're against

520
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
And it's a philosophy

521
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
Safid of trying to

522
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,680
Undermine nationalism and National sovereignty in order to sell out to multinational corporations and what have you

523
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,800
If that's what you're really mad about that doesn't have a physical component to it

524
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
If you're talkin about why these people

525
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
Look like globalist

526
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,504
Generally speaking that means that you are talking about something

527
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
That is

528
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Something about their appearance

529
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,560
What is easy really busy

530
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
Think that the global is look like hipster is that what

531
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
I mean it could be

532
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,008
It could be anybody who looks

533
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Not as white as a

534
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
If it's next to skip over it I think

535
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
It's not that great

536
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,040
Cambridge analytica about how like

537
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Information

538
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
So what

539
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:35,744
Remember when you railed against the Patriot Act

540
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Scraping account

541
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Spore data it's not

542
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Like

543
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
A little bit isn't mining just scraping the ground for s*** and he's not taking into account

544
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
How would the actual thing they did

545
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Where they

546
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Encroached on other people.

547
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
Accounts through accounts that they had

548
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,392
That's another wing of their operations

549
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Can stop a lot of it was

550
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,792
Gaining access to personnel

551
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,656
Account and then by accessing sad that they were able to get information for

552
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
From a bunch of

553
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
All of their friends

554
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
Two billion accounts information were stolen when only when they only had

555
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,480
At the beginning is like 400 million

556
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:34,368
He also tries to bring in like an idea that people think that it was identity theft and all it is is

557
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Taking it

558
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Texas

559
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
That was never reclaim

560
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
The people are making

561
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,792
Right so anyway he runs us

562
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
The whole thing

563
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
Pointed out is that

564
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
Metadata

565
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
Can be used

566
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,288
To influence a ton of s*** like

567
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
It's disgusting how much data

568
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
We we actually put out there

569
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:01,504
You can learn from things that you don't think actually says all that much

570
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Right

571
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,832
But I mean

572
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
You get just a very amount of information from somebody and you know how terrible people are at remembering

573
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Passwords or like those

574
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
I forgot my password

575
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,216
What's a what's your mother's maiden name

576
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,288
It's easier to do than anybody wants to imagine

577
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,408
Runs out of steam really quick on this brings up Rodger

578
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
My mother's maiden name

579
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
That's a shame

580
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
Tough to spell

581
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
Inspired a little bit

582
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Because of a bad diabetic

583
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,376
Doesn't reduce dick on the front and the back

584
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Alyssa

585
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
But

586
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,544
Then he gets off he's he's a he's generous with his time does it take five or so

587
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Alex

588
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Come back up

589
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Who's this

590
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Super f****** weird

591
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
Truck

592
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Crushing

593
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,696
Nicole swap example

594
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Sellout

595
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
Your resources

596
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,776
Quite frankly

597
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
That

598
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,736
The claims over

599
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
You'll notice first of all no applause after that

600
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,976
Staring at him like

601
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
Boy

602
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:54,656
Is Galaga

603
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Stand up

604
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
Yeah whatever

605
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
I hope do it anyways like

606
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
To do a trump

607
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,528
Style rally

608
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,928
There's a couple people every now and again little applaud certain things in my head

609
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
It's not a raucous

610
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
They probably are like

611
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
It's not 1000%

612
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
He's like four

613
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,472
The more the more important thing to do is there in that clip you saying that

614
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
He's now concerned

615
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
The Trump is going

616
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
Too far in the other direction

617
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
Sure

618
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
What is that Alex

619
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
What is that

620
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Too far with nationalism

621
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,416
What happens when people go there with nationalism

622
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
18 different examples of TT going too far with nationalism things International

623
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,568
Believe it of ever happen

624
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
So he even said that

625
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Really expire

626
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Again I think he's drunk

627
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
But anyway

628
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
On record

629
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,008
They haven't

630
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
Motels

631
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
No it's not

632
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Got it Brandon Gilmore

633
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
That's good he's getting help from the Georgetown

634
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Civil rights

635
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,768
Feels like he has to specifically point out Inner City

636
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
Always really saying is

637
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Black

638
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,728
Surprises me that he didn't have diamond and silk

639
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,776
Hazel

640
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
Why not you're going all out for this

641
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
You got a ride other

642
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,480
Trump weirdo why not why are all of your people still White

643
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,416
Like why is it like you're trying to do this Optics involved why don't you at least get some of

644
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
The creeps

645
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
Right

646
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Diverse Creek

647
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
They're all creeps on his team

648
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
But at least there are a couple who like

649
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
You would add

650
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
Diversity youth Shield yourself from the attack of like

651
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,944
Millie Weaver Rob do Alex Jones Rodger Stone Jerome corsi

652
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Lee Stranahan

653
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
Lucian wintrich

654
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,952
Lucian wintrich is the whitest name I've ever heard before.

655
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,912
We've gotten Jakari Jackson to run down the aisle head with a chair

656
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
I bought Jakari Jackson

657
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Comic book

658
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
It's fine

659
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
It's not about Alex at all I would have loved

660
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
To discover that he

661
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
Tremendous Talent

662
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
It's very cute

663
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,832
It's about a

664
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Like a young child who doesn't

665
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Applied himself well

666
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
Because he's too busy daydreaming

667
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
The description that you busy daydreaming of a segregated Society description that we read as it led us to believe

668
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,544
Leave the possibly this was about like to put a

669
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,640
Projection about Alex

670
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
I'll give you a call at your earliest

671
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
Watch

672
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
American Way

673
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
That's a federal filing

674
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
Real quick break

675
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
Let's take a step back and

676
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
Consider all of the people that he has on the show

677
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Who have connection

678
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,312
Koch brothers related to think tanks or

679
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
He still talks

680
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
2

681
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,480
Lord monckton on mobile

682
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
This is all nonsense

683
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,880
Soros

684
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,232
You say Soros overthrew countries

685
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
All former communist authoritarian rule

686
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,424
Fake left

687
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Audience

688
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
Stop

689
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
No we're talkin about

690
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
George Soros

691
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
Funding you

692
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,935
He doesn't he also says that like Chuck-E-Cheese the rat

693
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
Who ostensibly is Jordan klepper

694
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Can come on

695
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,383
He doesn't allow that

696
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
That man right there

697
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
George

698
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
Nazi collaborator in the world

699
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
Call there's more

700
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Financing

701
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
Georgetown law

702
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Overtime

703
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
First Amendment

704
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,615
First of all there is literally zero chance that a civil lawsuit could overturn a Amendment to the

705
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
The Constitution

706
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,479
Completely absurd cockamamie.

707
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
Rulings

708
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
Even

709
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,695
If you allow for what Alex believes about George Soros

710
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
To be true

711
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
If you allow that which it's not

712
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
But if you believe that he helped Roundup Jews as a fifteen-year-old

713
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
That's still not a

714
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Top-level

715
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Not

716
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Oculus in Hitler's

717
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,271
There was.

718
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,111
When he was 12

719
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,743
That's ridiculous nonsense

720
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
How much

721
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
Absolutely

722
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
Despises left it there

723
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Liberal

724
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Libra

725
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,495
And then at the same time is super mad at fake left

726
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
How that could possibly work earlier he just said

727
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:06,783
Leftist

728
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
I just call them

729
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
Regular if you hate left

730
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
So much why are you concerned with the

731
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:19,071
Purity of their last album

732
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,911
Music music Michael calls himself a classical liberal which makes

733
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,215
Now and then

734
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
Regular liberal

735
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,359
Which makes no sense either and then he also hates

736
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
What is

737
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
He was he's just angry

738
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:40,575
What other than white nationalism

739
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Sucks it up

740
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
Cupid step up the other thing that I think is really sucked up in

741
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
My clip is

742
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
I mean I know it's a small crowd

743
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
But at the same time you still have a guy

744
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
Who's yelling at the podium

745
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,751
This guy works for a Nazi collaborator

746
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Furthermore

747
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,895
Year-old Oskar Groening

748
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,295
Simon wiesenthal

749
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
Escaped

750
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Escape

751
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Nazi Collaborators

752
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
All of these are older than George Soros and the murders

753
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Collaborate

754
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
I know that I already said that

755
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Repeating

756
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
He's

757
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
Pointing out someone in the crowd

758
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
Who is a journalist

759
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
This guy works for a Nazi

760
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
This guy works for George Soros

761
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,343
I like a much larger audience

762
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,743
With a more charismatic person at the helm then Alex Trump did the exact same thing

763
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
You could turn that into

764
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,559
Do something very dangerous

765
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
This guy

766
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,727
That's very close to like this guy is part of the Union

767
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
I feel very

768
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Ratably uncomfortable about that

769
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,687
Just because George Soros has donated

770
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
Do a sound ation

771
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
Is it May

772
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
Donate

773
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
To rightwingwatch

774
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
Or one of these organizations

775
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,719
You don't understand level I do still despise

776
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
That you just described you know like

777
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,119
Oh well he can't be mad at George Soros

778
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
For donating to all of these things

779
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Whenever

780
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
He is

781
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
The Holden to Koch brothers and all of those things

782
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
No I'd like batter frustrated infuriates me as well

783
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,927
The topic has come up and maybe there are new people listening who don't know are staying

784
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:59,327
Plugging super into Soros like the reality that he is not a Nazi collaborator

785
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
It's like a beneficent

786
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
King like

787
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Get the first part is

788
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Technically good

789
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
Really bother

790
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,943
Billionaire is still a billionaire

791
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,527
Stopping around how much money Bill Gates

792
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
His money should all be seized and he should be beheading

793
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,695
What is a right

794
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,351
Just agreed to be heading

795
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
Cuz you advocated for murder

796
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:41,055
I'm so also one of the big things you were saying but that last clip is all the people on the left

797
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
You're stupid

798
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,895
All your stupid you don't know about

799
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
Right you don't know about all this stuff

800
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
I know stuff

801
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,551
Alex Jones talks about

802
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,831
John Hancock

803
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:59,231
And we'll see just how smart Alex

804
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
Confront

805
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
Better

806
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
My wife

807
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,311
Who decided

808
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,271
Real quick I'll start it every time he lies

809
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
John Hancock did not sign the Declaration of the

810
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,879
July 4th

811
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,183
I was signed on August 2nd 70

812
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
876

813
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
On July 4th

814
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Congressman

815
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
And voted on the Declaration

816
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
So Alex is already wrong

817
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
It was either

818
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,543
Victory against

819
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin

820
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,903
So John Hancock sign

821
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Swamp Fox

822
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
First because he was the president

823
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,815
Continental Congress

824
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
He signed first

825
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,167
Also super annoying for everybody else too

826
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:21,151
Showboating

827
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Dirty Trickster

828
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
I'm also the Declaration of Independence

829
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Not sent

830
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
That was not part of it at all

831
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,207
No sent to other nations in colonies as an attempt to be like

832
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
The British

833
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,583
Bulshit the goal was to explain to other colonies

834
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Why was a good idea for them

835
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Declare independence

836
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
And sent other nations

837
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
As adjusted

838
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,007
Vacation so they wouldn't be on the side of

839
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,103
Absolutely no point

840
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
To be like

841
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
Hey King George

842
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Suck it

843
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,759
The strangest thing about this is I

844
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,087
I kind of disagree with America declaring independence

845
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,903
Because really what was what it was about was like

846
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Tiny little tax

847
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Stuff

848
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Because the King was like

849
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,959
We are giving you a s*** ton of Mike this is essentially the trade deficit argument if you are if you are so

850
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Supporting Trump

851
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,591
Levi you f****** tariffs against China you're a

852
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
The Declaration of

853
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Interesting

854
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,007
Nazi collaborator

855
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Denny's

856
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Not true at all

857
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,551
Haha don't answer questions

858
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Pakenham

859
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Fairplay

860
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,631
Cooper

861
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:31,199
He was disinherited

862
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,271
Forget about that no money when he

863
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
What are you

864
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,367
No I don't know

865
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Never

866
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Never got money

867
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,767
When he was a child his parents told him he was not going to any of his narrative

868
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
Because it's probably that one

869
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
There wasn't

870
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,423
Rated over

871
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
And because the family is diffuse

872
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,383
And they've done a few studies on that we're within three generations

873
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,015
Things most wealth is is gone

874
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
There's not the same like consolidation of we marry within 3 or 4 times

875
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
You is

876
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:19,583
The of the only way to consolidate your money is due at the way that the old my did then didn't

877
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
Exactly

878
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,007
Interviews about

879
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,567
It's very clear on record he has no money

880
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
They came from his grandma right

881
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
You did

882
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,623
What up piece of Filth bracket.

883
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,351
What

884
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Otherwise

885
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,615
Soros alone I will not

886
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
About you

887
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,743
Crostic that's where they put the code

888
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Message in there

889
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
If you look at the first word of every set

890
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
That's the moment where I'm most felt like

891
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Weird

892
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
Basically in the middle of a Nazi rally

893
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,287
Because Alex is lying about George Soros

894
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
Nazi pass

895
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,871
He's screaming about go to hell

896
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,175
Where you came from he's drunk

897
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,479
He's up there he's rambling nonsense

898
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:45,599
He's repeating The Lure about John Hancock and having some kind of

899
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:51,999
Truth

900
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,071
He's lying about everything in such a way that it's just

901
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
A boy

902
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
Manifesting is

903
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
Maybe throwing that is he throwing the hand up

904
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,871
Izzy Izzy throw the hand up or is it down

905
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,735
Which Hitler are we getting

906
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,319
Slams on the podium are we getting the Hitler that salutes

907
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
We're getting the sweaty Hitler was holding on to

908
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,159
The podium

909
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,463
Chubby sweaty Hitler

910
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:28,863
Play some hip hop

911
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
In the middle of this rally

912
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
Market freedom

913
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,311
Classical liberalism

914
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
The song

915
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,911
Bill Clinton

916
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,303
Oceans are strong like this is the kind of Hosting I've seen it

917
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,447
Terrible shows

918
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:42,847
That's what I want to be I don't want to scream it b****** to get out of the way

919
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
I'm not saying that he's yelling at women

920
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,783
Make it sound like that's a criticism

921
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
I just think it's stupid

922
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,367
Maybe a little bit

923
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
No I don't think so

924
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,975
I think that's why he did move move

925
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,791
The second time around cuz he even was in his head being like

926
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
You were just a b**** last

927
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
B****

928
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,007
I think he's probably just drunk

929
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Also

930
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,407
He said in the previous clip he was going to write books right

931
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
You can't do that

932
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,319
He can't do that nor can you make documentaries anymore you made a documentary in like 12 years

933
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:33,535
Not to be fair to him either

934
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,583
I think I'd be a whole lot of work

935
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,399
Hayward makeup

936
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
You just need an editor who you're paying

937
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
And then just tell him

938
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:50,175
You know what are we could get a grants from somebody to make a documentary about Alex Jones I will steal the

939
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:55,039
I will steal that ribs

940
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,623
Score of the entire f****** thing

941
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
I don't know if we can afford it

942
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,023
I don't think that this is what was being referenced in the

943
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,303
In the chat room salon

944
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
Broken Arrow

945
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,423
And it was in the middle of me doing the right thing

946
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Poirot

947
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
Anime

948
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,943
Donna Donna

949
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
On the Orient Express

950
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,135
Disappointed I love David suchet I love

951
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,463
Borrow I love mystery that show I love it all

952
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
I do not think

953
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,071
Get the murder on the Orient Express as a good story

954
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,911
It's really not everybody does it that's not good

955
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
What's his face

956
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,407
Murder on the Orient Express

957
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,247
The one without

958
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
Brenna Brenna

959
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,135
He is maybe the most insufferable actor I've ever seen

960
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,279
It's fair how much prefer things like the ABC murders that was a good one

961
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,471
Three little Indians ugly that was another good one for a lot of obvious reasons

962
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,031
Weaver AKA rainbow snake

963
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
Gets up to the mic

964
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
Let's hear some of this

965
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
She has an interesting perspective on Charlotte's

966
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,623
That's cuz he was there and that's all she has to go on it

967
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,183
That's sort of Infowars claim to fame

968
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,975
Is that she was at Charlottesville

969
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
Weeping auntie

970
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
By George

971
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,287
That's based on those fake documents of a sound unfortunate Alex Napoli's

972
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
He's now claiming that they've been verified

973
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
Know what happened

974
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,295
No one

975
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:15,071
His arguments about it for a while

976
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,887
No one told me to stop so they are real

977
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,959
Boo boo

978
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,495
Shity love

979
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
If it was if it was wrong somebody would have said something by now right

980
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,735
That's why he has to go to

981
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
Okay bye

982
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807

IPhone

985
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
I was there on the ground

986
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Anime

987
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,655
Immediately

988
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,935
Singers of violence

989

One-sided

00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
Coming from

992
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Right

993
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
Oh we have a

994
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,367
It want to try it

995
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Removing

Element

1002
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,807
Hold on

1003
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
You did have them

1004
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
Radical right

1005
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,351
Stretch out their box fort

1006
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,191
So that you can see by the entire right

1007
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
Demonize Trump

1008
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
Trump movement

1009
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,079
So you're keeping score

1010
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
Literally a narrative that is built

1011
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
To just

1012
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
Defy white supremacy

1013
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,783
Okay hey

1014
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,367
People who were out there

1015
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:20,767
They're also funded by George Soros but there also are being funded by George Soros

1016
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
In order to come out and scream

1017
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:28,959
Blood and soil catchphrases

1018
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
That

1019
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:36,383
Really. It's memorializing history was put up a years and years after

1020
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,991
30 or 2

1021
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:47,391
We got to have the image of the Confederacy the time that they were like

1022
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,047
All of those like spikes

1023
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,607
Confederate statues that were put up over

1024
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
Apparently are at times like when the Civil Rights Movement was going

1025
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:09,407
Remembering we used to own you

1026
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,479
Her point of that their radical left

1027
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,879
Does terrorists and they're only demonizing they're all right and it's like the alt-right is fine except

1028
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
For those people

1029
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,303
Who has the FBI recently classified as a terrorist organization

1030
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Antifa

1031
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:33,471
Minimize

1032
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,055
That's not a threat he also said the Juggalos

1033
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
Yep nonsense

1034
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,223
Absolute nut

1035
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
Is it one of the larger

1036
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
Just cultural mouthpiece

1037
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Pieces of this

1038
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
Permissive

1039
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
Of white violence

1040
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Terrorism

1041
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Directions to Sonic

1042
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:08,799
Now we're seeing these things of like taking questions about lgbtq identity out of

1043
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
DeSantis

1044
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,919
It's not a big deal

1045
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:19,295
There's reasons that those sort of your citizenship test in there as well

1046
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,855
But those things are very important because

1047
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Without

1048
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
Those

1049
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
Sort of metrics

1050
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
You

1051
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231
Lose track of

1052
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
Statistics about

1053
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,559
Hate crime

1054
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:35,935
What's up you say what is and isn't a hate crime

1055
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:42,591
The groups that are having him I mean maybe

1056
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
Do you know a bunch of dudes or

1057
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,711
Affiliated with

1058
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
Groups like identity

1059
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,039
Europa answer to white supremacist groups

1060
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,831
Beat the s*** out of the black guy while screaming

1061
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Slurs at him

1062
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,415
Charlottsville

1063
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,207
Find me feels like a hate crime

1064
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
Hood

1065
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
You could class

1066
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,559
Fire dispatch but feels like it

1067
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
I don't know

1068
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,703
Probably be.

1069
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,055
Deep State actors

1070
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,407
It's a frustrating experience to have

1071
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Like

1072
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Get

1073
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:24,575
I get why they feel like it's necessary so many news organizations put that out as like

1074
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
Alleged hate crime

1075
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,207
You have a video of somebody screaming racial slurs

1076
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,255
And beating up a black person

1077
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,583
That is not an alleged hate crime

1078
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,655
If you have a justice system

1079
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:45,055
That is trying that very black person who beat up by white people making racial

1080
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,895
Where is that him as though he is also guilty of assault

1081
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Justice system

1082
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:55,807
Is perpetrating its own hate crime both sides

1083
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:01,695
No it's not it's not

1084
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,999
Mueller's investigation because the FBI

1085
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,047
Has been a white supremacist

1086
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
Bright white supremacy

1087
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Organization

1088
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,143
The very f****** begin

1089
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
The Democrats are running on

1090
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
Let's get rid of f******

1091
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,311
Because if we actually do take the house

1092
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
They're not going to do it they don't have to

1093
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,271
Women should make up the entirety

1094
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,087
Trick Daddy take it to the house

1095
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,743
I get it I agree

1096
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,279
I'm just angry

1097
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,935
Restart your rant

1098
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,311
Huh

1099
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,639
Quick break I got

1100
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
Alright

1101
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
That sorry about that bro

1102
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,039
First-time caller

My my right calf

1104
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
Can ain't doing it

1105
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,231
Perfect

1106
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,071
Millie Weaver

1107
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,887
Supremacist white nationalist rally

1108
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,471
Made the feel real strong Alex is drunk

1109
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
Straight drop

1110
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,359
Any further sorry to interrupt you for like the millionth time

1111
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
Billy Weaver

1112
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,223
Seems like she's

1113
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,063
Like those people who almost

1114
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:37,183
Like when she starts talking about how corporations are funding all of these people

1115
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:42,047
Seems completely unaware that all of the billionaires

1116
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
Behind

1117
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Populist movement

1118
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
The Tea Party

1119
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:54,079
Directly behind all of this s***

1120
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,895
Confuses me

1121
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,967
Withheld from her or is she aware of it

1122
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,527
Can't believe she is

1123
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
She seems

1124
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:07,391
Now this may read this baby Leighton sexism on my part

1125
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,487
Are you not aware that we're covering a propaganda Outlet

1126
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
Good faith

1127
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,911
Can imagine her in like a backroom conversation

1128
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
Being like

1129
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:25,567
Man I'm telling you I know these right-wing billionaires are running the country but that's where my bread is buttered

1130
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
You know

1131
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,895
Like she seems like

1132
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:35,295
Like she seems like why

1133
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,367
Original I mean there's so many

1134
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
There's so many like profiles of what some young white nationalist a****** who's got who's

1135
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
Believe

1136
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,143
Always wind up being something at the base level

1137
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
If you just start with

1138
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:57,567
Billionaires are controlling everything you're like yeah

1139
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,103
You are right on board

1140
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,175
Because the left

1141
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
No

1142
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
I think it's the

1143
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Just willful team sports

1144
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:13,183
I think it's just that probably just like any kind of

1145
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,095
Groupthink kind of cult thing they inoculate themselves against any information that denies their narrow

1146
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,239
The other side

1147
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:32,639
Which billionaire

1148
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
Beings ever to exist

1149
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Generally

1150
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Sometimes they can have

1151
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Benevolent

1152
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Intentions and sometimes I can

1153
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
But

1154
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
Shouldn't have that much money.

1155
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,463
Yes

1156
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,255
Refuge

1157
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,303
Alex is drunk

1158
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,375
Millie gets off stage there

1159
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
It's crazy Magic

1160
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Probably

1161
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Could

1162
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
What's up

1163
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Theosophy

1164
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,335
Just about it

1165
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
Do you want

1166
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
I think that it's one of those things where he

1167
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
He knows that he explained Chuck-E-Cheese the rat

1168
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
But you going to have a couple more drinks

1169
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
And I was like

1170
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
I don't know if I really explained it so he gets back on stage

1171
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,951
Everybody knows explained

1172
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,975
Absolutely

1173
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Jordan klepper

1174
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,151
Justin Foster concert comedy show

1175
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
In Florida

1176
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
I did say that

1177
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
Slander definition

1178
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
That's what he does

1179
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Citizens School of Journalism

1180
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Texas

1181
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,047
Misrepresented

1182
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
Chuck-E-Cheese

1183
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,287
Or some other men that makes them look bad

1184
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,359
Pcloud evaders

1185
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,527
Continuous

1186
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
And I can't even have a conversation

1187
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
No no no

1188
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159
Sony later out there waiting

1189
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695
You know you got ass kicked today

1190
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,023
Just that you're a fraud you're a scam Chuck-E-Cheese a rat

1191
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,583
You see one of these guys George soros-funded

1192
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
He's back here

1193
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,679
Like they're journalist

1194
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,239
A paycheck

1195
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,519
They're going to lose

1196
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
Solis

1197
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:50,879
You're not going to protect yourself from a comedian by saying Chuck-E-Cheese the rat over and over again

1198
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,671
He will just make a bit about that

1199
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,999
So that's probably what's going to end up happening

1200
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:01,375
And then the second Jordan klepper which

1201
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,911
I'm guessing it's not

1202
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
No.

1203
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,359
And then I don't remember the idea of like

1204
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,223
All conservatives are always mad at

1205
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,575
It really must be mainly because they don't understand why they

1206
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
Can't be comedian

1207
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Furiated

1208
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
Just have like

1209
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
No

1210
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Ability to laugh

1211
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
I know but also what

1212
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Shroyer

1213
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:39,007
Owen Shroyer did not make the cut for the road

1214
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:46,431
Hitman David Knight had to stay at home and the host Alex Jones a show for it

1215
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:49,247
Of course he is there is cuz he was already there

1216
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:53,599
That'd be great if it turns out course he does a wonderful Jordan

1217
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
That'd be great

1218
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,255
Citizens School of Journalism

1219
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,047
In Texas and I don't know what that is

1220
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
I don't care

1221
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:11,007
Probably something we should look into but I assume it's at least

1222
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,799
He's he's gotten

1223
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
I need to look more into it

1224
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,407
But I'm not entirely sure what that.

1225
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,247
Interest too much

1226
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
Dumbshit's thought I'd ask a question since it's your job to do all the research and I don't have a bunch of stuff

1227
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Everything

1228
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:35,327
I did research this next question is why our donors are not giving up the big bucks I researched

1229
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,935
Stranahan talks about people that Alex

1230
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,751
It's been really interesting

1231
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,847
Here's one reason they hate Alex Jones

1232
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
Right

1233
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,783
In fact agreement

1234
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,111
Hanging out with my friends

1235
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,415
What home is gone Andrew Breitbart

1236
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,327
He was on coke all the time probably was fun all the time

1237
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,423
And I missed

1238
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
I'm hanging around somebody

1239
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,519
My other friend is Dog the Bounty Hunter

1240
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,359
When is a little bit of

1241
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,943
Remind me of dog

1242
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,783
Is a picture

1243
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
Hahaha

1244
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,879
I'd like to read you a quote from Dog the Bounty Hunter

1245
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,439
This is

1246
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:37,535
It came out from the conversation he had with his son

1247
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,327
Inspired by the fact that his son

1248
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Was dating a black girl

1249
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
Quotes

1250
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
I'm not taking a chance

1251
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,263
Not because she's black but because we use the word and sometimes here

1252
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,615
I'm not going to take any chance ever in life of losing everything I've worked for 30 years

1253
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,991
Because some drunken and hurt us a n and turn us into The Enquirer magazine

1254
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,295
I'm not taking a chance

1255
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
At all

1256
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
Never in life

1257
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
Never

1258
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,695
The the thing that reminder

1259
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
Meaning of Alex in that state

1260
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
Is

1261
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:12,095
A complete understanding about the

1262
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Right

1263
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:16,959
I'm not taking a chance that some

1264
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Call

1265
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,519
Hear the

1266
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:25,663
You don't understand what just happened

1267
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,223
Also if anybody

1268
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,015
Puts me in the sentence with

1269
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,039
You know

1270
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
The same thing about

1271
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,671
Jordan and dog is I take a lot of pictures

1272
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,951
I want to be out of that too

1273
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,255
I want out of that sentence so fast

1274
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,655
I wanted the Dog Bounty Hunter is

1275
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:51,263
Dog the Bounty Hunter

1276
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,871
Good luck is a private conversation that he had that got leaked

1277
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:00,223
It shows a certain amount of guard up

1278
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,527
And in that conversation is like

1279
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,855
I don't want to present around cuz we use the n-word sometimes

1280
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
And I don't give a s***

1281
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
We just use it

1282
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,695
Because we don't give a s***

1283
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
And I know that it offends black people

1284
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,303
And I don't give a f*** about that now that

1285
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,423
You're coming to dinner movie right there

1286
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,959
I'm sure it was not a comedy

1287
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,751
I think they would get the rocks

1288
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
Play back bro

1289
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,383
And then also Dog Bounty Hunter got in trouble because he went out of his jurisdiction

1290
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,943
And I got somebody

1291
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
The Bounty Hunter

1292
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:38,623
Ukebuddy went to Mexico and got this

1293
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:43,231
You got in trouble for that

1294
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:49,119
Court case took so long

1295
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:54,495
Extraordinary rendition isn't under their purview especially if you're a reality star

1296
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,823
He ended up not getting in trouble. The case got thrown out

1297
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Because of a statue

1298
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,431
The dirty business

1299
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,735
Yeah you can't go to foreign countries

1300
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,759
Expedite

1301
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:10,367
Before that

1302
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:15,487
So now here Lee Stranahan he really vocalizes what

1303
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,839
The feeling of this after press conference

1304
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,911
I was expressing earlier than people

1305
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
Make

1306
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,703
The littoral states

1307
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
We're among friends

1308
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
So I can speak

1309
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:34,687
Edward among friends

1310
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
Knowing

1311
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:40,063
It might as well be that but I mean they still broadcasted this

1312
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,927
This morning I was trying to

1313
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,487
Remedia you want to be conciliatory

1314
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,791
Christian

1315
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
I want to be open and inviting

1316
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
But now I'm a month

1317
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,167
Friends

1318
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,543
I'm not trying to make you feel badly for the left

1319
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,847
But Alex said something very interesting

1320
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,919
Recently he was talking about he did it

1321
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Who is yd

1322
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,295
Three days ago Sunday or something like that

1323
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,135
Where you was talking about I used to live in Austin so I know there's a lot of hippie

1324
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
Hippie Hollow

1325
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
Used to be in favor of free speech

1326
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,631
Used to like

1327
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,495
Remember when they were

1328
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
In Skokie

1329
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
Remember that

1330
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Jessica

1331
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,711
What

1332
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
We're talking about this

1333
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
George Soros

1334
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
Oh boy

1335
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,671
Do George Soros destroyed the Lac

1336
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
By funding a bunch of organization

1337
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,559
You can go to the ACL use website

1338
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:59,423
You can find out about what they're actually involved in right now it's people just don't actually pay attention

1339
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
Mansion 2

1340
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
It's hard

1341
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,287
Look at the website you got to go

1342
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:11,455
March 29th 2018 that Alex Jones probably would be super into that the ACLU

1343
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,295
Police fighting in court instead of screaming about impotent Lianna internet show

1344
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:19,903
ACLU report urges City sometimes to provide internet service as a utility

1345
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
That's something that Alex Jones

1346
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,719
Super into

1347
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,839
They're protecting about

1348
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,887
They are

1349
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:35,519
They're working with students in Louisiana about the door order to take down a mural

1350
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,359
On the grounds that it's a violation of their free speech

1351
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,455
Let me just goes on and on and on

1352
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,991
The ACLU

1353
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
Has done

1354
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Everything

1355
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Possible to

1356
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Not

1357
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
Not

1358
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Support

1359
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Causes

1360
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
But support

1361
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,999
The actual defense and rule of law

1362
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:00,863
Absolute like even when you disagree with them as in the

1363
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
Aforementioned

1364
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
It's still the rule of law

1365
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:10,335
You know is if you don't apply the law.

1366
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:16,735
You don't actually have a legal system like real talk if Alex Jones had illegitimate

1367
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
First Amendment breathing

1368
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,575
Will be the first people who would support him

1369
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,391
They do

1370
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,559
I mean here's a press release that they put out from March

1371
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
7th

1372
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:35,935
This year

1373
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
Supposed to measure with

1374
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Restrict public comment

1375
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Exit meeting

1376
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
The Proposal

1377
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
Prohibit political intellect

1378
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
In common

1379
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,895
Disruptive inflammatory self-promoting threatening

1380
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
Or interfering with board

1381
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,759
Feel like they're doing all this s***

1382
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,343
On a local level on a national level

1383
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
That are

1384
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
Making a difference

1385
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Consider trying to help

1386
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
People

1387
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
All he does is

1388
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:06,911
Why are they are they called a leftist organization

1389
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
By the right

1390
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,007
Because they want to apply the law Tico

1391
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
And that is

1392
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
Anathema

1393
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
To write philosophy

1394
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,408
Especially far-right philosophy

1395
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,200
The fee which is essentially authoritarian

1396
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,272
When you do that when you apply the law equally

1397
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
The

1398
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,320
Hard right will

1399
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,600
Always fight again

1400
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:32,256
Yep. No but I just I find this disgusting because

1401
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
ACLU

1402
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,584
Is still living there mission

1403
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,424
The only rationale you could possibly have

1404
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
Fort Knox

1405
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
Dingbat

1406
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Is willfully

1407
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,312
You have don't let you don't care about what they're doing

1408
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:51,456
You know like that's really

1409
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,040
Appointment

1410
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,904
Damn independent noxious recently a number back when they did that in Skokie

1411
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
Has a

1412
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:10,656
Nazi candidate running for congress overwhelmingly

1413
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,960
CB all good luck

1414
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,728
The right to do that

1415
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,568
They still do that you'll still hear stories

1416
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,896
Even in the last few years of ACLU defending their rights

1417
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
To have

1418
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,944
A demonstration

1419
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Ratchet life

1420
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,040
It's f****** b******* Lee Stranahan is just

1421
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
Lying

1422
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,112
To perpetuate a narrative

1423
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
That the left

1424
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,928
Principal

1425
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,744
In service of demonizing George Soros

1426
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Also

1427
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,168
Actually just talking about the Blues

1428
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:51,104
Remember the Nazi rally in The Blues Brothers I think that's what he's actually reference

1429
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
My mind

1430
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
Glitch

1431
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,712
Because I started thinking about Chubby Checker

1432
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
It's not Chubby Checker

1433
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,040
Who is it

1434
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,880
Chuck-E-Cheese the rat

1435
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,256
Now I'm thinking of checking

1436
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,280
The wrap

1437
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:14,656
As as like Chuck-E-Cheese brother in a in a Hamburglar situation

1438
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,216
I'm enjoying that whole life

1439
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
Never

1440
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,824
I don't want to try and get into this weird fantasy that my brain

1441
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
No Doubt

1442
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
Is he did the twist

1443
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:31,808
Now all my brain can do is think about the time the Chubby Checker did that song with the Fat Boys

1444
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,856
So did the other version of The Twist

1445
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:40,768
What's the mic down clip for you

1446
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
Lee Stranahan

1447
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,864
And now we bring up that old

1448
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
Puffy b****

1449
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:53,312
I really hate calling people a b**** or anything like that for some reason everytime I see Jerome corsi

1450
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,128
It's swollen a b****

1451
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:04,320
I don't know why she's the person who get that like you folks

1452
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
In a like

1453
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
Ark

1454
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Clear that you're a propaganda

1455
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:14,816
Abundantly clear in Riley ever on the show

1456
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
Your entire life has been about propaganda

1457
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,192
You were brought up by Edward Bernays

1458
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,264
In the propaganda game

1459
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,616
You are clearly a person who has written books

1460
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,664
About Obama's birth certificate

1461
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,504
Are John Kerry in the Swift boat situation

1462
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,064
Your entire career has been about lying

1463
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,600
And now I look at

1464
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,392
You and you make me sad

1465
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:43,232
You look like you got f****** left out in the water too long

1466
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:47,072
You look like a bloated corpse

1467
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,144
You piece of s***

1468
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,192
I hate him so much

1469
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:54,240
I hate what he's done to the world

1470
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,032
Baby just makes me

1471
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,848
Do waterlogged b****

1472
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
Anyway

1473
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:08,064
Motion for me I've been I've been holding up holding back a lot of Jerome corsi

1474
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,344
Now

1475
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,880
He's doing all this qanon

1476
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
It's over like it's even better

1477
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,864
This is a delightful

1478
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,168
So he comes up in this press conference

1479
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
It starts talk

1480
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,496
Qanon she turns out

1481
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
She knew about it

1482
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:33,920
Citgo which is counter counter-coup

1483
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
But

1484
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,784
Because we've done our research we know that this doesn't match up with Jerome corsi

1485
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
She's timeline

1486
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
At all

1487
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,392
I want

1488
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,160
3 years ago

1489
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
Water

1490
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
About three years

1491
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
Barack Obama

1492
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,944
Also sorry Jerome corsi is terrible like sex

1493
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,064
This is amazing this is no one should allow Jerome corsi

1494
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Any kind of

1495
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
Rally

1496
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,392
Closer to the mic

1497
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,584
Heather a few weeks later

1498
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:24,864
Call

1499
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,848
That was Alex

1500
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,920
Screaming from the back of the room

1501
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Six Flag

1502
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,952
Trump agreed

1503
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Wood rot

1504
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
And they agree

1505
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,328
Run

1506
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
There

1507
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,424
Coup d'etat

1508
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Rudy

1509
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Tradersway

1510
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,568
That's not a concern.

1511
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
As we've been

1512
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Alex

1513
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:18,880
Military

1514
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Intelligence

1515
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Nope

1516
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
And

1517
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
What's the truck

1518
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
And the intelligence

1519
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
Forgetting

1520
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
That we've explained

1521
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
Really

1522
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Inside screen

1523
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,032
Course he just gave up the game

1524
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:42,432
You just admitted that a lot of these excited formation that they pretend comes from sources comes home

1525
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,992
Yeah you just basically gave it up

1526
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,320
Like he's like a lot of this inside information

1527
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,856
From this internet hoax

1528
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,904
This is

1529
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Wow

1530
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:58,048
Like we haven't done sad we haven't really sad we haven't talked a lot about qanon

1531
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:04,192
Because why would I probably

1532
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:08,544
Narrative

1533
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:15,200
Then we realize our always begun talking about now is that

1534
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,016
Alex is trying to catch up

1535
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,320
The conspiracy world is too fast

1536
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,440
888 he's just not able to put out enough content

1537
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:29,536
It's just a bunch of random dudes having a great Ole Time

1538
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,120
Exactly what they want

1539
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:37,216
Open cryptic.

1540
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,752
And probably will make a

1541
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
Shitload of money

1542
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,592
Once they give it up and write a book about

1543
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,224
Wannabe Macklemore Killam

1544
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,760
Pages that are just hand tie

1545
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,856
So the end result of this

1546
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,136
According to Drum Corps

1547
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Amman

1548
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
I would say that this

1549
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
Describes what they are

1550
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:04,864
Traders

1551
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
Crater

1552
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,216
Is a capital crime

1553
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,008
And I want to

1554
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,544
Predicament

1555
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,552
Even Hillary Clinton

1556
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
And Barack Obama

1557
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:33,024
Request

1558
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,888
Unlock garage

1559
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
And Donald Trump

1560
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
Heat

1561
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Play a role

1562
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,440
Did you hear her troubling what he's saying is

1563
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,720
All I know is that

1564
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:08,608
In historically military tribunals have been the best part of every functioning democracy

1565
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:15,008
Especially when they're brought up to punish your political right

1566
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,848
Really aren't even political rivals

1567
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:23,968
Trying to consolidate power and punish your perceived enemies

1568
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,856
Also Jerome corsi at the end there saying that Trump has a vision

1569
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Of the world with

1570
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,208
Him staying involved and he has for decades

1571
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:38,560
It doesn't sound like

1572
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
With the timeline

1573
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,384
Green overlooking the 2015 that around

1574
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
The time

1575
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,712
3 years ago which would have been in April

1576
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
2018

1577
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,808
Jerome corsi wasn't at all

1578
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,880
He was even in about

1579
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
September

1580
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,184
When he would come on Alex Jones

1581
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:11,328
The show and talk about it he said the Trump was just f****** around he wasn't really serious once he was even running

1582
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
So the idea that

1583
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,448
And even more specifically back then if he had that in for

1584
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,752
Formation

1585
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,336
No he wasn't for you would have told Alex

1586
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,920
No I mean just on General Bible

1587
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
This is this is

1588
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,552
Before the whole team got behind Trump

1589
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,112
So this is still that read well

1590
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,136
3 years ago

1591
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,976
That still when they would have joined like Jordan

1592
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,304
You're stupid

1593
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,352
Bus 14

1594
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:49,728
If in Jerome corsi timeline that he's pitching now present day

1595
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,032
The three years ago

1596
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:58,432
For Donald Trump decided to run for president and get Obama out of off

1597
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:02,272
Ron

1598
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
Have either been like

1599
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:16,096
Hey I know that there's a secret coup d'etat going on in truck we got to get behind him

1600
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
The bastard has been like

1601
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,936
Alex I think you really should support Trump

1602
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:25,312
His first couple of appearances after Trump announced that he was running

1603
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:31,712
And was on the trail or like he's not this guy is you got to still love

1604
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:38,112
Love Rand Paul of course make any f****** goddamn sense at all

1605
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,160
Corpse on the beach

1606
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,696
That f****** hate him

1607
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,000
Stupid dick hole

1608
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,792
I love it

1609
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:59,360
We're just going to open up every show now with you

1610
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,968
And esoteric in Zelda

1611
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:10,368
To describe Jerome, Jerome corsi with your laying down in the sand I poked you with a stick in it

1612
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,816
What sucks about it is like the only ever own swamp

1613
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,400
Bloated balls just exploding all over everywhere

1614
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:28,800
Like mushrooms in a fairy ring you are. This is the problem

1615
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:33,152
My head is legitimately a waterlogged corpse

1616
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:38,016
That's all I'm going to do

1617
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:44,160
Of course you suck

1618
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,696
You can go with a river I think

1619
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,024
I think the reason that I'm so mad at him is his history

1620
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,816
He's so f****** pretty

1621
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,608
Like it's like

1622
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,032
Specifically three years ago there's a lot of people who make me mad and Alex Jones's world and what have you

1623
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,848
He doesn't make me mad I hate

1624
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,664
You know I like there's other people who unlike

1625
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,456
I'm more interested in explaining

1626
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,784
Do you why this person is a problem

1627
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,344
Want to do a dance on his face

1628
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:19,744
I love it when it gets personal with you

1629
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,352
I don't know how much you hate this

1630
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
I don't know why you

1631
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,448
Me so boring

1632
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:36,128
I think it's a combination of bordova and murder

1633
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:40,992
Hamamoto Steve

1634
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,040
And I generally don't listen to as much as

1635
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:48,160
I think I only get I only get trickster God

1636
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
I'm I'm I have

1637
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
Such

1638
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
I mean I want to call it a fetish

1639
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:57,376
Metaphorical kind of a fetish because in the way that I listen to Infowars

1640
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,936
I can really only get it up for people who are creative

1641
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:04,544
I can really only enjoy it when I

1642
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:08,640
Coming around, Modo Larry Nichols

1643
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,712
These types of interesting crazy

1644
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
Interesting

1645
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,856
He's a boot-licking assholes it's like a

1646
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
Your you're

1647
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:25,792
Tasting imported like eventually to escalate to the point where it gets more and more shirt

1648
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,840
Of course you need something you need

1649
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:33,472
In order to make things

1650
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,032
Alex's

1651
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,080
That sort of white bread

1652
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,664
Mainline mom and popcorn

1653
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:49,600
Send run-of-the-mill that's already in a weird place right there

1654
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,928
Especially these days get off this topic

1655
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,232
My point is the

1656
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
Knowledge

1657
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:02,144
Feel like I got railroaded

1658
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,704
Picture of course I do I love it

1659
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,288
Anyway up in this next clip we get someone who I'm not really as a

1660
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,056
Excited about

1661
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,896
Don't care about

1662
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,200
But

1663
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
U disc

1664
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,720
Cast me as a human being

1665
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,304
Like every part of his life

1666
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,656
Bums me out might as well be mini Rodger Stone

1667
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,448
Like you sort of

1668
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,752
Shittier more boring

1669
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:42,336
F****** a monstrous Rodger Stone

1670
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,896
See him is kind of like a satellite

1671
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:49,760
Dirty trickster in training like the

1672
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:56,160
All of the beginning with all that pizza

1673
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:05,888
Not going today not going to the pizza place in creating a hoax out of it

1674
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,424
No not at all

1675
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,496
We see this

1676
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
He's very easy to see through any

1677
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
It's not that interests

1678
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,104
But you'll enjoy this first clip

1679
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,408
For he tries to get a USA chant going and it

1680
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,432
It does not work

1681
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,712
Coronavirus

01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
He's revealing

1705
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
He is and that is

1706
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,664

Say that

1712
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,696
Is it always talk

1713
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
He said

1714
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Jack one day

1715
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,680
American

1716
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,448
Baby

1717
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Baby adopted

1718
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
And that's the way it's going to

1719
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
He said that's why

1720
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,248
Really shocked me

1721
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
USA a verb

1722
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,416
Impoverished country

1723
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Where I

1724
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Where you can

1725
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
Alright

1726
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,984
And I don't want my child to grow up in

1727
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,776
That's going on

1728
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,312
Recline and that is why

1729
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,872
I fed all the 2016

1730
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,408
Working my butt off

1731
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
For Donald J

1732
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:02,528
Strong and that's why I spent all 2017 I'm going to spend all the 2018

1733
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,832
And as long as it takes

1734
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,368
As long as it takes

1735
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
Thank you so much

1736
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:12,256
So he closes out his his set as it were

1737
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,816
I really don't like

1738
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,584
That he said

1739
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,376
No I had a Chinese

1740
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Visit partner

1741
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
That's not good

1742
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:25,312
I don't know if that's how you phrase it but if it is it somehow I missed my ears

1743
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,456
The thing that's important is that

1744
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
White nationalism

1745
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
White supremacy

1746
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,088
Based on the 11:00

1747
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
Onwards

1748
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,672
Most of it is about

1749
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,440
Securing attic

1750
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
Sims 4 white chili

1751
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,584
That is very spiritually similar to what

1752
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
He's talking about

1753
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,912
Offensive

1754
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,496
Babies would be sent over

1755
01:39:54,752 --> 01:40:00,896
Coded up bits of language

1756
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,712
Personalized

1757
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:09,344
Play I don't give a s*** about me or not so I don't take care to get the

1758
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:15,488
A big fan of it

1759
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:21,120
You have no idea right I don't want my kid growing up in a country that's in Decline

1760
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,912
Send them elsewhere

1761
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
No no that's not even

1762
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:30,848
Concerned about

1763
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:37,248
I'm like well what's the what's a f****** infant mortality rate hear you f****** idiot that's what it what are you

1764
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
Talking about

1765
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,320
In the same way the people who like

1766
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,600
Attack abortion clinic

1767
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,904
Because they're concerned with

1768
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:50,560
Bored

1769
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,096
It doesn't match the belief

1770
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
And the belief

1771
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,656
Then he's espousing is

1772
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,496
More or less

1773
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,992
Very clearly to express that's why I supported Trump

1774
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
And that's why I'm going to

1775
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
Continue working so hard for him

1776
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,112
And all this mess

1777
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
There's so many like

1778
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,024
Every time every time these guys get

1779
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,792
Eclipse

1780
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Take a note

1781
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,120
Where it's like well obviously you're talkin

1782
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,400
Think about how you're a white suit

1783
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,472
Their likes

1784
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:30,752
I just

1785
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:34,080
What have we have we have

1786
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
Years-long

1787
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,920
F****** rap sheet

1788
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
Supremacist

1789
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,504
There's no taking this out of

1790
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
Contacts

1791
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,552
You are

1792
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
Literally

1793
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Prove

1794
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,416
A white

1795
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
National

1796
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,232
You pretend otherwise

1797
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:56,096
Is f****** ridiculous and it's insane that they realize it's like

1798
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:03,520
Among friends

1799
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:09,152
Why don't the Bounty Hunter. He's free to say the n word

1800
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,992
That that's her to think that's because they're free to say things

1801
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,064
That clip of Pacific talking about

1802
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,416
I don't want American kids being adopted by Chinese people

1803
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
That's I mean that's dog with leave for sure

1804
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
Yeah but it's

1805
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:30,656
There's a name to it to Rio lights up

1806
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:35,264
How come African Americans

1807
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,360
Wiggle wine

1808
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,664
American baby

1809
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
F****** p

1810
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
Absolutely

1811
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
Why

1812
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
So

1813
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,392
What do you mean

1814
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,952
Are you f****** me

1815
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
Like what is it take

1816
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,768
To not be a white

1817
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,560
Is it like is it just

1818
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,584
Can't

1819
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,144
Just be that you were raised

1820
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:09,056
The part of it like it was a traumatic experience that.

1821
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,920
People who go to church really just kind of hang out

1822
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,528
The benign version of it but yeah

1823
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,344
I think there's a

1824
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
Interesting articles

1825
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,392
Recently about

1826
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,440
Conspiracy of being a shortcut to Phoenix

1827
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,000
Smart because you have like this idea of like

1828
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,280
Our believe

1829
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,864
This I know the truth

1830
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:39,264
But I could do know what's a smart smart

1831
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,152
Because I have this alternative now I haven't researched papers about

1832
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,480
Truth

1833
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:52,576
That I saw on YouTube 7% of scientists

1834
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
Can be wrong

1835
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,624
When they talk about

1836
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,184
Yeah it's only the 3%

1837
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,720
We know that

1838
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Spira see behind

1839
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,608
I'd like a shortcut to feeling smart

1840
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,912
And I think there's a disenfranchisement

1841
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,936
The people's feel pause

1842
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
Possibly

1843
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,312
Supremacy gives them a shortcut to

1844
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,080
Being

1845
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Awesome

1846
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
I mean

1847
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,736
How to make

1848
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:26,112
I'm a piece of it probably justification for it so much as a

1849
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:32,512
Psychology behind it

1850
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,840
Excuse me

1851
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:42,496
Because you were asking like what do you get out of there automatic boost

1852
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
Perfect sense

1853
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,592
It's not a coincidence that everyone on that stage

1854
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,872
Write a note

1855
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
It's right

1856
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:49,920
Anyway

1857
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,712
Finally

1858
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:56,064
You like with with both of our insecurities and mental illnesses

1859
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,904
You think we'd be better off if we were white supremacist Dan

1860
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,952
Not too much baggage

1861
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,744
Comes along with it

1862
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,584
Going to hang out with weirdos

1863
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:14,240
That's a good smell good you got to be a proud boy that's the worst part of it alone

1864
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:20,128
Is disqualified if you ever watched any documentaries about like neo-Nazi

1865
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:26,528
Two groups and stuff like that it's really fast out the Green Room that sound about right

1866
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,672
You can't go wrong that's the movie I'm starting Doc's baby

1867
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:37,536
If you watch documentaries about white supremacist groups a lot of the times you'll find

1868
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:42,656
If you were in the place of the person

1869
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:44,960
The documentaries about like who do like

1870
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,728
Why do I have to hang

1871
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:48,032
Yeah these people are assholes

1872
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,824
What am I doing

1873
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
Garage

1874
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:58,272
Hang out in garages garage like

1875
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,064
I'm talking about a garage

1876
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:05,696
Finally an hour plus

1877
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,256
Speeches that get to the actual q-and-a session

1878
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:10,304
Wisconsin

1879
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,424
I enter Alex is too drunk to do it

1880
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:22,592
Star Trek Q

1881
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:32,576
Alright we're going to open the floor to questions Billy Weaver up here and I'll come if you want

1882
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,160
And then he kind of just disappears for a long time after

1883
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:39,488
After this

1884
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
He's

1885
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:43,072
He's doing something probably yelling at Chuck-E-Cheese

1886
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,680
I think we all agree that Trump

1887
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,728
Historical anomaly

1888
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,008
It wasn't really meant

1889
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
And

1890
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,616
There's discussion that

1891
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,640
That Alex

1892
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
And

1893
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,736
And mr. Stone Rodger Stone had about

1894
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,784
Basically

1895
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,808
Street fighting pack

1896
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,344
Versus

1897
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,880
Long-term strategy

1898
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
Token

1899
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:11,232
I want to save this guy is a very valid question

1900
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
And so my question

1901
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,608
Rodger Stone and for Alex Jones

1902
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,912
Or outside of street fighting

1903
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,240
Outside outside of short-term

1904
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,520
Street fighting

1905
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
Gorilla attack

1906
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,336
What's the long game

1907
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,896
And who has the long game and I'm

1908
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,456
Talking 20 30 40 50 years

1909
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,760
And I like to throw in one

1910
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,040
Caveat

1911
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,648
Question for both of you

1912
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Please

1913
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,232
Can you all them in that

1914
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,304
How do you work with institutional Christian

1915
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,328
Organization

1916
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
And your long game

1917
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,960
Now I'm going to give you a call

1918
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
Yes

1919
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,264
Do you think

1920
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,568
Alex has a decent answer to the question

1921
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,384
Leopard to boil this question.

1922
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
The question is essentially

1923
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
Can you actually governor

1924
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,784
What is your idea

1925
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
How do you get it so you guys have taken over

1926
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:19,840
You threw a couple uppercuts

1927
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
Right

1928
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,680
How do you govern and what's your plan

1929
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Christ

1930
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,776
So I assume

1931
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,568
Alex is responsible.

1932
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,360
No we can't

1933
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Huh

1934
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:34,688
The second part of the question is based on Alex Jones

1935
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,968
Is rampant distrust

1936
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,952
Any Christian organization

1937
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:51,840
That's not Patriots first and a very few reasonable position that he still made

1938
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,632
Your your prediction

1939
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
It's pretty accurate

1940
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,728
Chirp

1941
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,008
Thank you

1942
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
American

1943
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
Not an answer

1944
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,664
Not an answer

1945
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
Just doing a bit

1946
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
You help

1947
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,096
Right

1948
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,120
That's all I'm doing

1949
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:32,288
White nationalism is not a given that

1950
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,056
I think it is

1951
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,360
Telling the truth

1952
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,640
Exposing WhatsApp

1953
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Not being

1954
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
Group

1955
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,440
Individually

1956
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Checking out

1957
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,512
That's not an answer

1958
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,792
That's nothing

1959
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,584
If your answer is

1960
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,888
There is no way to govern

1961
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,656
So

1962
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,424
Nah

1963
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,960
That's a badass

1964
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:01,984
It's just

1965
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,288
I mean he just is rattling off his catcher

1966
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:07,872
Phrases you might as well if y'all 1776 2.0 and stir

1967
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
They would have been

1968
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,688
It wouldn't have been out of place in that

1969
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:17,088
String of bulshit But ultimately what he said at the end there was there's no organization that is going to help

1970
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:24,512
Well I mean if you want to if you consider the government and organization then you are

1971
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,072
Essentially advocating for

1972
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,608
Complete and utter chaos

1973
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,400
Anarchy there baby

1974
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,216
I mean I think what he's just saying is

1975
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,824
The streets I don't know

1976
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:44,736
That's great I'm going to not answer it because that is a hard question to answer

1977
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,808
It's a dawn answer because he has no grasp on policy

1978
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,136
Well here's what we would like to

1979
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,720
University initiatives that we would like to push for

1980
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:58,560
It doesn't address the ideas like are we going to evolve Christian organization

1981
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:04,960
At all and that answer questions

1982
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,240
Humanity which means nothing

1983
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:11,616
I believe that I can just do what I'm doing and you do your thing

1984
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:14,688
I'll go Diamond keep telling the truth

1985
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:17,760
I'm going to keep exposing code for

1986
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:24,160
I'm going to be a white supremacist on Aaron repeat Russian talking point

1987
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,208
I don't I don't it's just not answer

1988
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,072
Great question though

1989
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Steve

1990
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,912
Either

1991
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,728
I can't see really any group

1992
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,264
Answering

1993
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:43,104
Crabs have a 30-year plan

1994
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:49,760
I think if you don't grasp on

1995
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,296
Nobody to talk to

1996
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,832
Mainstream

1997
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,112
Actually

1998
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,416
You could talk to the conservatives or liberals.

1999
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:59,232
Even even middle-of-the-road would have a much

2000
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
I disagree I think their answers would be stupid

2001
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
They wouldn't be nothing

2002
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:11,008
Maybe if you try any one of these

2003
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,848
They're not going to give a solid consistent answer to

2004
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:21,248
Like here's how we survive the next 30 Years and what's more important is that Alex

2005
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
Terrible

2006
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:26,368
Rodger Stone

2007
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,192
Or a video

2008
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,752
Or break

2009
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,056
Or anywhere

2010
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
Dory

2011
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,384
Freedom

2012
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,992
And post it

2013
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
Your social

2014
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
Because you see that

2015
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:06,816
Don't disturb your plans Facebook shares

2016
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,840
A warrior

2017
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:08,864
A nympho

2018
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,632
Warrior

2019
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,192
Nice

2020
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,312
Pace

2021
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,872
Hurt

2022
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:22,944
So I control control wax what are we doing

2023
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:34,720
Extreme truck from the back of the room

2024
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:35,488
8:30

2025
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,120
I mean Rodger Stones answer to the question is help us spread propaganda

2026
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
Functional in like a

2027
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:48,544
Hey Sarah Link on Twitter shared on Facebook

Communities

Ohio

2037
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,224
When you believe it

2038
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,576
Almost no incidences of autism

2039
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:33,344
Back

2040
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,368
Statistically

2041
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,696
Are almost non-existent

2042
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:45,632
Jackson children

2043
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,008
What's one more question

2044
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,848
So I grew up Mennonite which is not honest but it's

2045
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Sota clothing

Should Jason

2047
01:54:57,152 --> 01:55:03,296
I have a lot of how that works

2048
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:10,720

Good paycheck

2054
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,408
Absolutely what Millie we were talking about other horseshit

2055
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:32,480
What she's doing is she's operating off a 2000

2056
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
5

2057
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,552
Story

2058
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:41,952
That was a non-scientific survey of an Amish community in pencil

2059
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,256
Very large one in Lancaster

2060
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Cineworld

2061
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,096
He claimed that he could only find three autistic

2062
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,632
The kid

2063
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,168
Three of them have been vaccinated

2064
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,448
An implied that

2065
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,984
Very uncommon thing

2066
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,520
In the Amish community

2067
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,056
It was not a study

2068
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
Is apocryphal

2069
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,384
These are just stories that he's relating

2070
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
And the ex

2071
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:04,480
Clung to it

2072
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,760
Like it's the Holy Grail

2073
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:08,320
The proof that vaccines cause autism

2074
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,600
Unfortunately

2075
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:14,464
A 2011 study in the magazine Journal Pediatrics

2076
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:21,120
Showed that 68% of Amish people had their children vaccinated which is lower than the national average but it's still

2077
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:21,888
A majority

2078
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,192
I also

2079
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:27,008
In a 2010 presentation to the international

2080
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,544
Society of autism research

2081
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,384
Researchers from the University of Miami and the University of Vanderbilt

2082
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:36,480
Discuss the research into autism in the Amish community based on interviews with

2083
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,248
1000

2084
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,064
899 individuals in multiple community

2085
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:42,624
They found a rate of approximately

2086
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,672
Shekinah

2087
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:49,536
They found a rate of approximately 1 and 271 children's playing autistic

2088
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,840
Also there's a clinic called

2089
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,144
Clinic for special children in Lancaster

2090
01:56:54,400 --> 01:57:00,544
Transylvania is specifically for the developmental disorders in Amish children which would not exist if those didn't

2091
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,592
The main reason that

2092
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,640
Suggested for why rates are lower

2093
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,968
For a diagnosis of Amish

2094
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,736
Communities

2095
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:11,808
Is that they don't have they don't have the stigma

2096
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,392
Diagnosis

2097
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:17,952
Sabaya

2098
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:21,280
Also Advanced like how people say that the

2099
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,560
Diagnosis of

2100
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,328
Doesn't has

2101
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:29,728
Explode and nobody understands why well if you go back they put peep

2102
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,752
People in f******

2103
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,544
Institution

2104
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
Further

2105
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:37,664
Because the populations are so insulated an Amish community

2106
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,992
There's a much lower genetic diversity in play which reduces the risk

2107
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,528
Certain diseases in elevator

2108
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,808
Another

2109
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:47,392
It's not entirely clear why autism would be one of them

2110
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,952
But it turns out that the one that has a much lower inside

2111
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:50,976
Unless

2112
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,512
Genetically diverse population

2113
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:03,520
Who's that at the door that rainbow snatch

2114
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
Is that your burning

2115
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,920
That was for the chat

2116
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:12,480
Alright

2117
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:18,368
We were just going based on an apocryphal story 2005 but got Traction in a T-Rex make

2118
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:23,488
But also there is always get traction

2119
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:24,768
And the debunking

2120
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,048
Never.

2121
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,376
Studies

2122
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:34,240
Rob gets on the mic everyone forgotten you still exist

2123
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
He shows up on the mic

2124
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,640
He said some really weird stuff one of the things I like to hear is that the bar is

2125
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:44,736
Does an open bar that's a good

2126
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:45,760
It's really weird

2127
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,952
15

2128
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,560
We should do that and just hang out

2129

Mango

2130
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,728
If somebody asked

2131
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,200
It's cuz I was too drunk to get back on stage

2132
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,440

Babe jungle juice at the back

2137
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,712
I don't know what's in that punch

2138
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:55,648
Radu baby

2139
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:59,232
Lemonade mix

2140
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,560
Is terrible terrible in my past

2141
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:06,144
He stole the margarita mix for my parents

2142
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,168
We're gonna have a good time

2143
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:08,960
Yeah

2144
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
They should have stopped at 6

2145
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,544
7615

2146
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,896
They take a question

2147
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,784
I don't know why

2148
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:25,088
But at some point right

2149
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,624
Before this guy asked

2150
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,392
2 question

2151
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:29,184
The audio starts going f***

2152
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
Terrible

2153
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,256
This is going to sound like s***

2154
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
And I apologize in advance

2155
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
But

2156
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:38,912
I will say I tried to hunt down alternate versions of the audio

2157
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,472
There is nothing that doesn't have this glitch in it

2158
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,264
Paper worth it

2159
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,544
For what ends up happening

2160
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,104
I tried to fix it

2161
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:49,408
I could not fix it would have taken me like

2162
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
6 hours to

2163
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:55,040
Go through and fix all the Audio I apologize for subjecting

2164
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,832
But I wouldn't do it

2165
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,112
Is it work one of these

2166
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
Craziest thing

2167
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:06,048
When we get to spoil it all

2168
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,656
You cannot imagine the look on Millie Weaver

2169
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,496
Why the f*** is Alex you're helping me with

2170
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,288
This is not cool

2171
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,360
So I hear is the guy his name is

2172
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,384
True Dave

2173
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,432
Inside stew

2174
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,968
But no

2175

Utah

2176
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
He's a genius

2177
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,576
He knows how to start at

2178
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,368
You knows how to start out a question

2179
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
With a plug

2180
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:33,440
Strangely enough he's a fake leftist

2181
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,584
Good afternoon everyone.

2182
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:46,496

So far so far

2185
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:04,928
People are making it out what do you say let's give ourselves a round of applause for being courageous

2186
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:09,536
Come out and

2187
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,840
What's his name

2188
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:12,608

No

2202
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:31,456
So to recap what you said so far is that the longest-running government in the world is a Christian government at the Centre of it

2203
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,224
Is a man

2204
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
Jesus

2205
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:44,768
What

2206
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,048
Jesus gets his

2207
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:48,352
But I'm going to go a little deeper

2208
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,912
That's wild

2209
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,448
That's nuts

Very clearly

2215
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,544
Say we are in the end times

2216
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:34,176
What should we be looking for Christ is the focus I have is

2217
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,968
Preferences that with

2218
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,296
As though everyone

2219
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,600
Already knows what we should be looking

2220
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,624
Looking for

2221
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
Critz is the folks

2222
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:45,696
Yeah

2223
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:48,512
I don't know what we should be looking for

2228
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,056
You have no idea where this is going

2229
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:06,432
I'm also to the chat room I appreciate everyone suggesting how this audio could be fix

2230
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:12,832
Trust me

2231
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:17,440
And maybe there is some really really long wait

2232
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,744
To do it this manually but

2233
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:22,560
Such a mess

2234
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,096
After you fix that audio

2235
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,888
Right

2236
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,472
I think this is

2237
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
Bring up

2238
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,312
I took this audio straight from Alex Jones YouTube

2239
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,104
He put this outlaw

2240
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,688
Oh yeah.

2241
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:45,088
It was like working on this and every time I make it

2242
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,416
Motion rate cut out the little black sand audio in

2243
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,720
Either way it's going to hurt the ears

2244
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,048
If we do not understand

2245
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,888
Millie Weaver

2246
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,616
Sonya, wait hold on

2247
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Yep

2248
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:23,648
So this guy

2249
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,928
I was like

2250
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,720
Now's my time

2251
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:28,512
To let everybody know

2252
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,840
I already know who crisis and and

2253
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
He did it perfectly

2254
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:38,496
He got everyone behind him by doing the plug products are going to love it

2255
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:42,336
First war in the end times

2256
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
You do plug

2257
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:50,272
Talk about Alex Jones for a long time a infowarrior from way back I love

2258
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,552
Call this look

2259
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,344
Christian Christian

2260
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,648
I believe in Jesus

2261
02:07:55,904 --> 02:08:00,256
And then you f****** Trojan horses

2262
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,216
Part where he's like

2263
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,568
No

2264
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,592
He's not mad

2265
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:18,944
Do you know I know but it's like just like

2266
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:19,968
No I am

2267
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:25,344
I have First Amendment rights

2268
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,928
This whole thing is about how his first amendment rights are being encroached on

2269
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:34,048
And now we started the episode with him trying to kick out what might have been Jordan klepper

2270
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:37,376
From his event

2271
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,912
And now we end

2272
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,936
With a moon

2273
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:47,360
Looks like it's just Shadows cuz

2274
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,456
To him like

2275
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,224
Dude

2276
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
Stop

2277
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,272
Like

2278
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:56,576
Hold on one second

2279
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,112
We

2280
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,952
Are crazy this is getting

2281
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,488
No no it's f******

2282
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:05,536
It's because it's getting too real

2283
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:06,816
Like

2284
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
Not because

2285
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,864
Sundial movies Christ

2286
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,680
Sun Myung Moon

2287
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:12,704
Mega wash

2288
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,472
Washington Times

2289
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
Hand washing

2290
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,008
X

2291
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,800
Is a load of s*** Journal

2292
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:18,336
Publication

2293
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,408
Stop the same narratives that Alex does

2294
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,688
And he does use them

2295
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:23,968
Mosasaurus a lot

2296
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,552
Sundown moon is related to a lot of funding

2297
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:29,600
No

2298
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:36,000
Are you sure he's not really sure of the unification Church

2299
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
Christ

2300
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:38,304
Sun

2301
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:39,840
Becoming

2302
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:43,680
Sunya sunya moon is related to a lot of funding

2303
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,448
Conservative

2304
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,216
Organization

2305
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,520
Right

2306
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,800
There's a lot of

2307
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:52,640
Connection between the narratives that Alex Jones puts out into the world

2308
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,944
And Sun young Moon funding

2309
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:57,504
Until this guy

2310
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
Is crazy

2311
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:05,952
But at the same time he's not crazy and thinking that Alex should be on the same page

2312
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,512
Listen to Alex for a really long time

2313
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:11,584
Like your focal point was Sunday on the moon

2314
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,120
The Washington Times

2315
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,400
It would make perfect

2316
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:15,680
Sense to you that like

2317
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,216
How to get to

2318
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,496
Alex

2319
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,264
Alex's

2320
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:21,056
Gino's

2321
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:26,688
When was the super behind Nixon and Reagan Alex

2322
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,224
Seems to like those guys

2323
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:36,160
Love it it's very it's very not he's coming to Rodger

2324
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:42,560
Just Stone as being like he was behind

2325
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:46,400
Bringing Rogers

2326
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:54,336
Love it introduces the question of does Rodger Stone have any relation with Sonia

2327
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,360
Two of them have had

2328
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:56,896
Parallel tracks

2329
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:58,944
Have they ever been in the same room

2330
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,272
I don't know

2331
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,320
Is Korean

2332
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:06,368
Yeah but was he white dude

2333
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:13,792
The Christ surgery you know that's Christ was Jewish and then he became White that's why all the Italian

2334
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,632
No weed one more Clampett's

2335
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:20,448
2 minutes long of him it's worth it

2336
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:27,104
Cuz he just Rambles more about Christ

2337
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,504
It's really funny to me the rest of it and you can go look at you

2338
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,576
He keeps being like

2339
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:44,768
There are moments like that that are really funny prize is great

2340
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,048
So there's that but

2341
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:50,400
Alex had his story bombed by a Mooney

2342
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:52,960
Love it which is going to be my punk band

2343
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:55,008
StoryBots

2344
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,640
It's been a really interesting thing cuz I I

2345
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:05,504
You know everyone but I wasn't expecting everyone wanted us

2346
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,784
To talk about

2347
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,808
The Press

2348
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:17,024
This is much more interesting drunk them

2349
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:23,424
Staubach goes out in public drunk Millie is doing her best

2350
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,056
She is dreaming of better things issue does as heavy lifting to do

2351
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,848
Maybe course

2352
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,384
She's drunk I can't tell with his

2353
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,152
Second

2354
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:38,784
I can't do it anymore. No more. No more metaphors for a

2355
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,832
Soggy

2356
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:41,856
Jeff

2357
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:46,208
Dapper cadaver in a bog

2358
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:52,096
Just a f****** Lake full of with blue lips

2359
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,376
His f******

2360
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,168
Tiny little

2361
02:12:55,936 --> 02:13:01,568
Knockout whiskey

2362
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:04,128
That's what Coursey f****** looks like

2363
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,688
Falcon dick

2364
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:10,528
Guy suck

2365
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:14,112
I love

2366
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,136
Doing his best

2367
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:15,904
Just started

2368
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
Just bananas

2369
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:20,000
Ain't no man

2370
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,816
You look at when you look at the totality

2371
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:23,584
As you see

2372
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,400
I think the major points I want to take away is

2373
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:27,168
This

2374
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:30,496
Has all of the flavor of a white nationalist Nazi rally

2375
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:34,592
That is a failure because the audience is not very

2376
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,432
They're very energy audience

2377
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:46,880
All that be crazy they were all behind him

2378
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:48,928
That be crazy

2379
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:55,072
Better better chance than pasovic could get going

2380
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:58,144
So that's one point then the other point is I really think that Alex is

2381
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,680
Trying to get

2382
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:00,704
Soros

2383
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
Som

2384
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,752
It's really funny to me

2385
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:04,544
That's never going to happen

2386
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,080
It's never going to happen

2387
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:10,432
There's no there's no no

2388
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:12,480
Just keep slandering him and eat it doesn't matter

2389
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,016
Cuz why would it matter

2390
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,064
What I find interesting about the

2391
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,088
Is that

2392
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:20,160
The only thing that will get us to sue him is if

2393
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:20,928
One of Alex

2394
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,208
Texas fans killed his.

2395
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:25,280
Which I think is a remote possibility

2396
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,816
As things deteriorate

2397
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,120
Might do it

2398
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:30,656
Possible

2399
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,496
About

2400
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,264
The coverage

2401
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,800
The press conference

2402
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:40,384
And the lack of coverage about this

2403
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,664
Yeah

2404
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,432
Is that

2405
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,712
Every time

2406
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:47,552
Every time we see this type of coverage

2407
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,576
From

2408
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,856
Rightwingwatch

2409
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:56,256
Media Matters go f*** yourself Adam Schiff

2410
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,024
So do you

2411
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,608
But we had to me is that they

2412
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:02,400
Always cover Alex

2413
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,168
At his

2414
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:03,936
Wrong

2415
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,472
Do you know what I'm saying

2416
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,264
Like they always cover Alex

2417
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,312
The most hour

2418
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:12,640
Colorado Alex at his weakest

2419
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:15,712
Gives up the game it's the strong embarrassing

2420
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:22,112
Conversion cuz kissing the flag and stuff like that is embarrassing

2421
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:23,904
Embarrassment

2422
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,184
Used his strength

2423
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,256
Like his inability his complete lack of

2424
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:31,328
Ability to feel shame just like Trump

2425
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,632
