1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,592
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
Flash have you ever been on a bow

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:30,208
Dear friend Matt a little bit of a boat

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
Excursion into a lake

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
Where is deeply hungover

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
I was swimming around and

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,424
Declared that I belong in the water

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
I was built to swim. I love being in that water I think it was just a hangover it's relieved by that

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Water

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,296
I don't know I'm not that I'm not generally on a boat

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
Go down to Belmont Harbor

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,184
Lake Michigan I don't have a yacht

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Nope nope

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,280
I don't understand anybody who owns a boat

16
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Chicago other than they are

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,168
Just people that idea of owning a boat in Chicago

18
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Thought about it

19
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Not terms

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Actually thought about it

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
But I imagined what it would be like

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
If the docket during the winter

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
The reason

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,512
To hire somebody to handle all of the bones of a boat guy feels that way

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,608
We're not both

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Tell me what the show is kinda about

27
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,056
We're back from our way of new folks

28
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Into the show

29
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Cuz I did get a number of messages

30
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Expressing the

31
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
The f*** is this

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
Not even angry whale

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Some confusion about why we were talking about

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
List

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
But I apologize for any

36
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Confusion about that

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
We are

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
One of the reasons

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
That is I of course

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
Duda news broke in the middle of the week if you had his mother came out

41
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,456
The most non committal bulshit that obviously means please impeach the president

42
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Committed

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
Novikoff

44
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Before a lot of the sentence

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
A little bit of

46
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
We can't

47
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Say that he

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Alex

49
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
We're going to have a real unhinged response to this

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,640
Did the show we have to record

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Put on Friday

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Alex is back

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,504
Studio on Thursday

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,344
Prepare episode in order to get it out on Monday

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
Get back to it but also I have a really strong prediction

56
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
He already has a

57
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
Mueller is a f******

58
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Game Trader for the

59
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,376
Narrative built into what it what is this going to change

60
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
It could just

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Like make him more

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Desperate

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,592
Or whatever

64
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Lycopene about how awful Mueller is

65
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Mueller

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
More be like

67
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
No he said a bunch of stuff to the report really basically means this you don't need to

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
Please if you are a Republican or a can

69
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Conservative or

70
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,376
Do not actually read the report because they will tell you things that maybe you shouldn't outfits diversionary

71
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
What's his role

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Yeah

73
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
It doesn't matter

74
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
Especially for Alex's coverage of it

75
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Me either a more RAM

76
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Version of it or

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,368
Exactly what he's been saying all along

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
It will do present-day episode on Monday

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
When we have more than

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
In front of us

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Back in the past

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
Check out what Alex is doing

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
In the aftermath of

84
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
News coverage of it

85
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Today we're going over January 29th

86
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Through 31st

87
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Yes the greatest

88
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
It's a good one

89
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
That's all I got to say about that

90
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
Devote

91
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Entire month of February

92
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
History Month

93
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
He's really going to go to

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Through a lot of

95
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
How's your tune after we left

96
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
The very first stand-up comedian

97
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Black

98
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Kate

99
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,175
Stand-up crap

100
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
People have signed up and are supporting the show

101
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
I'm a policy wonk

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Think it's Mark Richard

103
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,631
Perhaps

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,767
You are now

105
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Money off at heroin

106
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
Freakishly large

107
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
Thank you so much Alexandra

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Sport Chevrolet

109
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
These guys do that

110
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Show

111
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,887
Important to remember about this time. Right

112
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
January 29th

113
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Specifically

114
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
Is that we've crossed a line of demarcation

115
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,847
First of all we've had Alex on the last episode

116
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
I haven't gotten into the

117
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
These people saying that they were actors

118
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Now

119
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,695
Christian Anderson Cooper

120
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
100% proof

121
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Committed to that

122
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
He has signaled that he is

123
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Supportive

124
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Of those things

125
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Which is building upon him having

126
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Professor James Tracy

127
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
On

128
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
By Paul Joseph Watson

129
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
It's immensely annoying how it's

130
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Movies Littleton

131
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Any babies

132
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Just want him to like

133
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,303
Perhaps more importantly than any of the coverage

134
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
The point where

135
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Has sent Alex

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Some email telling him

137
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Time to stop

138
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,519
The point where he has gotten in contact with Alex

139
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Made

140
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
Infowars aware of the fact that

141
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Their coverage

142
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Having a negative impact

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
On their life

144
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
Yeah so everything after this point

145
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Really take away any

146
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,135
Volusia but he doesn't know the effect

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
It only gets worse from here

148
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Kind of

149
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
I mean

150
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
The Paynes

151
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
A bad picture

152
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Further on the Spectrum

153
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Stupid Flash

154
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Email

155
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,127
Then you're responsible for everything

156
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Episode

157
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
The first years and I work

158
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,303
No that's great

159
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
Buford piranhas piranhas of Liberty

160
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
I don't know what to tell you

161
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,151
Swimming up the urine stream of I make this promise

162
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
To our listeners

163
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,783
If I ever meet Alex Jones

164
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Messenger

165
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,207
Ono Liberty piranha

166
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
All right. It here we are on the 29th

167
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Never

168
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Expect anything

169
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Sing to delete

170
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
When I go back into the

171
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
The past or even a present look at Alex Jones

172
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,287
But here's something that I found delightful I will see if you can figure out why

173
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Cinematic film

174
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Why does this delight make

175
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Well that none of his previous documentaries have been powerful

176
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
He's quoting Orson Welles

177
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
But he's not calling Orson Welles from a movie or a speech

178
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
He's quoting Orson Welles from

179
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
Paul Masson commercial commercial real

180
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
We will sell no wine before its time is the tagline of Paul Masson

181
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Winery

182
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
If you guys

183
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,439
I would play this audio on the show but it's so visual go if you haven't watched

184
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
Go on YouTube and watch the outtakes

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Of Orson Welles trying to

186
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
2 film

187
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Commercial

188
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
It's a1421

189
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Famously

190
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Drunken commercial

191
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
It's not

192
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
To me that he's

193
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
He's passing off a quote of

194
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
That is actually just

195
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
Logan

196
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
Shiama commercial that he probably saw when he was

197
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
That's like that's the Orson Welles from Animaniacs

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
If I were quoting

199
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
Country goodness Siegfried penis

200
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Alright just dance

201
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,271
For the road Maurice lamarche

202
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Next week

203
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Difference

204
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Present-day Alec

205
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
And

206
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
2013

207
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,959
Social media

208
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
2013

209
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
They didn't this Mexico

210
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Itsfunneh

211
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
These sorts of things

212
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,223
About Facebook for example

213
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
Cannot operate without Facebook

214
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
You Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone

215
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Facebook as a joke

216
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
System

217
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
Now certainly he still believes those sorts

218
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
Seem to have any concern about the idea of it

219
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:21,375
You're entitled to be on in 2013

220
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Maybe because he got on it is business model shifted so heavily

221
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Towards

222
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
A sensationalist

223
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Promotion on social media

224
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
Quickbase without it

225
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Things Fall Apart where is

226
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,063
It wasn't so dependent on that back guy whatever some still had a f****** gold

227
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Can't put it somewhere where people

228
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
If that's a problem with

229
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
Make it better Cornerstone of your marketing

230
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Social media

231
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,335
Can't even muster the energy deplete I just want to be in the water

232
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Famously I just

233
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Sit here and

234
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
So I can open up Twitter and

235
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Try and type of promotional teams like

236
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Battle Lake

237
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,903
You are The Hungover piranha of lakes in my little teeth

238
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
I got three tweets

239
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071
Reading things where people talking s*** about Dave Brubeck that's all I want to do

240
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,471
From the 29th we get a really depressing caller

241
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Me

242
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Out

243
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
I feel very bad for him

244
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
I feel like Alex

245
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,271
Deeply explosion

246
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Oh yeah I completely agree I just wanted to tell everybody

247
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
I live on a $900 a month

248
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Spend as much money as I can on it

249
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Wards.com

250
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Rothman.

251
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
I bought every one of your hat

252
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,615
Anything I'm going to join the Paul Revere contest I'm going to do anything

253
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm considering moving to Austin

254
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
Just to just to be closer to your operation

255
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
These disabled that part of the quest Washington disability dollars a month

256
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Tons of Alex's merch

257
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Response

258
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Stop

259
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
You need to take care of yourself that's

260
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,311
You know you're out of fixed-income don't waste it on multiple shotgun shirts

261
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Specifically people who make $900 a

262
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Well what do you mean

263
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
Is given is going to say like that Alex is Paul Revere contest

264
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
That we know how it end

265
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Maybe short film

266
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,143
He didn't I don't believe so but

267
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Meowth

268
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
That is about

269
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
So we can have a caller

270
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
He bums me out for a different

271
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,199
Thousand dollars

272
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
Because of the content that he brings up but it also

273
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Offers us a glimpse

274
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
I think is really interesting into another

275
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
1

276
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
We have

277
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,399
Didn't give a s*** about entitled to it now

278
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Here is another one

279
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
This has to do with his rhetoric and worldview

280
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,639
I did have another point I wanted to ask you if you've ever heard of a man named Wally Chobot

281
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Shoebat

282
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295
He wrote a book called God's war on terror

283
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
And he's a former Muslim terrorist

284
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
And he would be a really good interview

285
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Happy to have them on

286
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Basically

287
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
The conversion that he had to Christianity was amazing

288
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
I mean because he was a full-blown I mean he was

289
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
No killing people

290
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
For Islam

291
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
But you really ought to read that book God's war on terror.

292
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
He doesn't care about islamophobia

293
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
He doesn't have that as a primary driver

294
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Of his of what he

295
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
He feel

296
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Call like that nowadays would be like

297
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
And not only that I'm going to yell for 10 minutes

298
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,727
Christianity because they are held by the

299
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah it is very different

300
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Respond today

301
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,455
It was a guy who has started making the rounds and right-wing circles and

302
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Early mid

303
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
2000

304
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
As The Story Goes Showbox was a terrorist working for the Palestinian Liberation Organization

305
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
He claims that he was a terrorist

306
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
And he was responsible for firebombing and

307
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Israeli bag

308
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
I called the bank

309
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Okay can I

310
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Interject 41

311
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Yeah he told me that he was

312
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
The former terrorist who wrote a book called God's war on terror

313
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Christianity

314
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Suspicion is he is not

315
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Real or not

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
He claims he was locked up by

317
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
He came to the United States and went to college here in Chicago

318
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Ultimately becoming US citizen and converting to Christianity

319
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
Ocean career with a book called why I left

320
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
Terrorism in the return of radicalism

321
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
He began to get more active in this line of work around 9:11 because he saw the outcome of terrorist

322
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Surrounded

323
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Southwest

324
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,175
In 2009 he brought in over $500,000 on the election

325
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Circuit

326
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Interesting Lee one of his clients was

327
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
The US Department of Homeland Security to pay them

328
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
He said things like quote

329
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,231
All Islamic organizations in America should be the number one anime

330
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
All of them

331
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
But here's the problem

332
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Showbox story involves specific

333
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
I know specifics

334
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,543
And when they are they turn out not to be true

335
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Because

336
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Specifics

337
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
If you do look into them and they're not

338
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
This is a huge credibility problem

339
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
There's no evidence

340
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Robot was ever involved

341
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,391
On the record and said there was no Fireball could match the description

342
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Time frame

343
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
The attack Shobha claims through carried out

344
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,071
The Israeli government is clear that they have no record of him ever being arrested or jail

345
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
His family members have said that his story

346
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Just doesn't make

347
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
And of course the story doesn't

348
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
A guy firebombs and Israel

349
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Especially

350
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
The story stretches

351
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Credulity on it

352
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Reflect reality at all

353
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
Now what I find interesting

354
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Things that I do believe one part of Showbox

355
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
Block Story

356
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
Money like crazy as the war on terror ramped-up in the following years there was so much money on the table

357
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Over former terrorist

358
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
Could give a glimpse into the mindset of this country

359
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Supposed

360
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
When there are no records

361
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Support the backstory of a cup

362
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Claim that you know you're you're using

363
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Luther

364
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
PLO terrorist

365
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
For the bounty on

366
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,343
When your family member say unequivocally that you are

367
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
The fake name

368
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
Sympathizers

369
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
I hate you for converting

370
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
The Christianity

371
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
There's always a way out of the quarter

372
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
As long as you're willing to be

373
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Which seems to be what

374
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Walid shoebat

375
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
It appears that way

376
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
He's spreading

377
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
B******* anti-muslim propaganda

378
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Department of Homeland

379
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Security

380
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,183
And of course this career Shobha trick to whole lot of people

381
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Prophet office

382
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
In 2008 he was listening donations

383
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Walid shoebat Foundation

384
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
She claimed is registered as a charity

385
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Pennsylvania

386
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,471
Although the Pennsylvania State Attorney's office

387
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Horse races pretty serious question

388
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
But the biggest questions need to be directed towards how it was so easy

389
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
For someone who is

390
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,503
Rhythm exporting counter-terror

391
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
For example

392
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
After the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando he said quote

393
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
The only ones loading over 50

394
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,463
He gave slaughtered our liberals idiots and gay lover

395
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
I don't care about gays who are Muslim loving anti-gun liberal

396
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,167
Stupid people late life die stupid people who hate life always die

397
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:01,823
After the Charlie have no shooting plotted the terrorist attack because the magazine had quote insulted the Virgin Mary

398
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
Like this is ridiculous s***

399
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
He's a little bit all over the

400
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
He's a little bit all over the place

401
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
It should be no surprise that he's a big

402
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Supporter of trump

403
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Theodore has explicitly

404
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
We called for Trump to establish a quote Christians

405
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Supremacist Society

406
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Be creative

407
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
No freeway

408
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
For homosexuals

409
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
There's no liberation

410
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
For perversity

411
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Weird mutant psychos walking around with clip liberal Dyke hair event dressing up as

412
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Looks like OSHA

413
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Stop

414
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Society would be arrested

415
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Put to death

416
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,952
In the present day will leave misunderstanding ship it sounds really similar to a lot of the stuff that comes out of Alex's mouth pretty regularly

417
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
But what interests

418
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Sing to me

419
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
Should I clip with Alex

420
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Interested in this

421
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,472
Even though what we do has been agitating against Islam for years

422
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
This point

423
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Third book

424
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
Islamophobia is not a primary part of Alex's marketing strategy in 2013

425
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
Which I assume is largely because

426
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
You didn't realize something that will

427
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
New from day one

428
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
And that is the Pacific

429
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Super lucrative business

430
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
He just hasn't gotten on board yet

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
That he's lying about being

432
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Terror

433
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Beginning

434
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
Later on

435
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
He becomes essentially at

436
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Terrorist

437
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Yeah

438
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
An apologist

439
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
That's a weave

440
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Pretend we know we become what we pretend

441
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
Yeah the master that we were too long because

442
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Yeah tunic

443
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
I think there's more just

444
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
If you don't have a real good through line

445
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
And you're just

446
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Shut off eventually

447
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
The worst parts

448
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Love yourself will

449
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Will become appleside

450
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Yeah I think

451
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
I think that's something

452
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
So Alex gets another caller British guy

453
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Who Alex's

454
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Is doing the fake ax

455
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Yeah I don't

456
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Okay

457
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Because he does

458
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,176
A pretty good handle on

459
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
British Affairs let's play

460
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Doubt he's just embarrassed

461
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
Sing Alex

462
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Okay cuz Alex

463
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Keep trying to bring up the

464
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Things he think

465
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
About like the Royal Family

466
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
Or Britain

467
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
And every single time

468
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Actually Alex

469
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Here is a cliff

470
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
Here is a clip of Alex getting embarrassed by British guy

471
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
Who is doing the fake accent

472
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
No idea

473
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
About the Royal thing

474
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Actually German

475
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
The name is pretty sure anyone else

476
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
200 years ago

477
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
I think that

478
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
Actually it's kind of more mixed

479
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
On the other hand I am defeated

480
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Hooters the boaters glad

481
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
That's embarrassing

482
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,328
What are you talkin about

483
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
I was talking to this guy for a very long time

484
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Is because

485
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,640
It gives Alex an opportunity to go

486
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
I think Alex is enjoying

487
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
But he's making good

488
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,600
Hubert you think so I think so cuz what I'm hearing is it from this

489
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Is a long interview

490
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Because it's

491
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
A fly guy, trying to get off stage

492
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,608
Hizi keeps

493
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
That

494
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
More than

495
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
He thinks what maybe but I would merge our two idea

496
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,896
But he also wants to come at the expense of making fun of

497
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
So if

498
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
It's sort of

499
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
But it reaches a point of

500
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Intolerable

501
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Seem like he wants to

502
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Hang up on you

503
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
He does

504
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
He seems like he wants to

505
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Going

506
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
The guys expressing

507
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Idea of

508
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
About

509
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
He's defending royalty

510
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Royal

511
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
And monarch

512
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
Alex is very dense that

513
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
You know being into the Royals is

514
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
Kind of okay cuz you're like you kept their nationalist

515
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,928
People leaving the royalty is a nationalist

516
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Holyshit Alex

517
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,328
What's going on

518
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,192
I don't think it's the

519
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
His his arguments

520
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
When walk

521
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Through

522
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
And ideas

523
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
So bad

524
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
He's like

525
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
Which is better

526
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
Does end up actually ending the conversation

527
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
It's

528
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
It's

529
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
Jarring because very quick

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Alex accuses him of letting his ax

531
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Wichita

532
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
If you

533
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Listen to what's being done

534
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Disgust you realize that this

535
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Is an intolerable thing

536
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
To have Alex

537
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
His narrative

538
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
This is 2 Central

539
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
What Alex believe

540
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
And this guy if allowed to keep talking

541
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
We'll end up pointing out how Alex is wrong

542
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
About the central point

543
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Of his beliefs

544
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
Will actually what I really think

545
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
Most of

546
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
What you're seeing comes from h.g. Wells

547
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,144
Yep that's right

548
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,240
Thank you look at the history when I say progressed if I don't mean

549
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
The modern

550
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
America around the

551
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
20

552
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
19th century

553
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Are there

554
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
Alex knows that he's out of his death

555
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,144
It will reveal that there is a larger political context to everything that he's

556
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,544
Trying to present to his audience that actually refutes a great deal of it and all Alex's doing is MIT purposing

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
F****** science fiction

558
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Authors

559
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
And then

560
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
People like Bertrand Russell

561
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Using

562
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
Stuff from their work

563
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
Selectively out of context and manipulative lie

564
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
In order to create this

565
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
Conception of the globalist

566
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,536
Pretty wild going from not knowing about him 2 and 3 months

567
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,376
Obviously debunking every stupid thing that Alex

568
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,704
I admire it in some way

569
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,008
Although I don't I don't know if I totally support

570
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Some of the conclusions that

571
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
British guy was dry

572
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Restraint ideas

573
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Okay

574
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
He was one of the better callers

575
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Of her.

576
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
If only because it becomes so clear how Alex

577
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Have to protect himself

578
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Like that your accents

579
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Got to go

580
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,280
Not at all actually played it back at number of times

581
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,352
Text Cliff Alex

582
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Or anything

583
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
The new idea

584
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Alex

585
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Excuses

586
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
White terrorism but I thought that this

587
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Shorter clip

588
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
It's kind of a perfect encapsulation

589
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Adjust

590
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
I thought it was worth it

591
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
As it is an art

592
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
It's just a perfect

593
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Set up

594
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,064
If you have the idea that they want so desperately

595
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Organs that are willing to

596
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
False flag terrorism

597
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
To blame on you

598
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
It ordered

599
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Facilitate getting your gun

600
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
Do you have that in place

601
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Anything can be faked

602
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,912
And the way you selectively use the accusations

603
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
Something's being fake

604
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Becomes

605
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
Important

606
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Because it's

607
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Reply it's revealing

608
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Absolutely

609
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,712
Clip is a perfect encapsulation of how you get

610
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,760
The groundwork laid

611
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,552
In order to excuse just about any

612
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,184
Alex talks about Bill Joy his article

613
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Nita

614
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
We talked about this a hundred times

615
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,584
Alex claims always

616
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Consistently

617
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
That

618
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
Bill Joyce article was about a meeting

619
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Of high-level

620
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Technocratic globalist

621
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Who we're getting together today

622
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
Discuss what to do about human

623
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
Once they are taken over by me

624
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
And robots

625
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
That is not true at all

626
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
That is only true

627
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Have a very short Passage

628
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
Where Bill Joy is literally quoting the Unabomber

629
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
Not discussing that as a

630
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
Technocratic

631
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
It is

632
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Rumba

633
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Unabomber Manifesto

634
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Yeah

635
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,144
Yeah it was announced it was a pretty good man

636
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
I've heard that from

637
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
People I don't want to talk to at Target

638
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Anita

639
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Why

640
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Discussed again

641
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
One reason

642
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
And one reason only

643
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
I believe in this clip

644
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
Alex makes it way to clear

645
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
That he knows

646
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
But he's misuse

647
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Send that article

648
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
And he knows that what he's doing

649
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
He's quoting the Unabomber

650
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,032
That's not in the article at all in the article

651
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Quotes the Unabomber

652
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
Not say that

653
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
This is crazy

654
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,136
He believes to be true about this article is just the Unabomber part of

655
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
F***** up cuz the Unabomber as part of the globe

656
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Obelisk

657
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
Through it

658
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Cut through the bull shakes

659
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
MKUltra program

660
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
I don't know but whatever it is

661
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
Read the rest of that article

662
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
Bwild zurita

663
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Outfits

664
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,160
About Alex's

665
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
Beliefs about what the globalist

666
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Plan to do

667
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
We're about to hear Alexei

668
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Something

669
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
News radio's Jimmy James

670
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Might be able

671
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,568
Donkey wrestler

672
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,672
That's literally me

673
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
What do you mean you're not going to take me into the bathroom with you I mean it makes sense that Alex would have his buddy Joe Rogan

674
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,752
On the show it was great

675
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
Very

676
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
The 29th

677
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
There's not a whole lot going on

678
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,320
LabCorp 30th there is not much going on at the show either

679
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
Alex has a guest cancel

680
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
And so he has his second

681
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,768
One of Ron Paul's

682
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,424
Yeah it's so weak in one of Ron Paul's Buddies

683
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
We have to second-guess

684
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Need a good saying for like 2 hours

685
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Who will never f****** lie

686
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
Questioning

687
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,560
The military brass

688
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
General

689
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,712
He's been talking about

690
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,760
General

691
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:10,112
Mr. gyro is talking about

692
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:26,752
Mario run

693
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Fortunate

694
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Get up

695
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
Marijuana recent episode and we went over how he's admitting to shut up about Obama giving soldiers

696
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,376
Iran US citizen

697
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,984
How is clams

698
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
To get female children out of China which

699
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
He's most likely making up entirely

700
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Jim Garrow

701
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,016
On the show his fake leak from his high-level source is gone viral

702
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,856
Has become a huge talking point the right-wing militia Patriots

703
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
More days until Obama second-term it's being seen

704
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Baby dum dum

705
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
As the best shot they have of getting Obama in

706
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
And

707
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
Bring a present

708
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
I guess

709
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,192
Which is their big goal

710
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
I don't think we learn too much

711
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,824
Tennis episode that we didn't know before but I find it slightly interested

712
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Vaquero secret sources General

713
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,272
. despite the fact that literally none of the details agueroooo is given him buddy source

714
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Match Boykin

715
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,928
Bicycle brain is fairly convinced that Alex knows aguero's just making this up it's kind of freedom

716
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Makes it up to

717
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,536
Girls going to call Alex's Bluff by revealing his not exist

718
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
System source

719
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,864
So Alex has the green light to pretend he's solved the mystery

720
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,984
Make himself look super clever

721
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,312
A little about how Alex

722
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Qanon early on when it started

723
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,968
He's really just messing with the whole thing but he also said he was behind

724
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
It's a smart Gamble

725
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:19,136
What someone else is running a con they can't really do anything about it if you decide to piggyback their con

726
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Without risk

727
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Blowing up their entire

728
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,536
That's just one element that this kind of thing their minds

729
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
We have a guy coming on the show and giving out Crypt

730
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:34,496
Verifiable information that it comes from a high-level military Source who is just

731
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
Get the word out and people about the evils of the left

732
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
There's less and it's a little easier to collab

733
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Jim Garrow

734
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Or when tons of pain

735
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,088
Patriotic ex-military officers don't start coming forward to back up his b*******

736
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
But the framework there is very similar

737
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
But

738
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
It's very it's very strange

739
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
I'm a hundred percent convinced

740
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
Both of them know that they're both full of s***

741
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
Just thought that I had

742
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
But I definitely think more about but there is

743
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
There's kernels of like

744
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Similarity

745
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
In the skeleton

746
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Yeah

747
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
I think you're probably a lot of eggs

748
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Is Greer

749
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
It's kind of interesting to think about like

750
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
When Steve pieczenik would come on

751
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
In the lead-up to Alex decided you love Trump

752
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,584
Until about the counter counter coup against the Clinton

753
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
Yeah very similar

754
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
Lucas where's Steve

755
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
It might as well be you

756
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,616
Right only differences

757
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,176
Steve pieczenik as opposed to an anonymous message

758
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Convey

759
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
So

760
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
There's something really interests

761
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
I need to think about it a lot more

762
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
But I'm a hundred percent

763
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Hundred percent sure

764
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
That they both know that there are no steak

765
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
Call the other one out this like I'm f****** around around 2 cuz then Alex

766
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,192
I know it's General Boykin

767
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
I'm smart I figured this out

768
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
And then

769
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Alex

770
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
To take control of the naira

771
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
Because now he has a narrative

772
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
About

773
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
General

774
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
Which is no longer

775
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Jim Keras narrative

776
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Jim Goetz

777
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
Keep playing his game over here

778
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
Alex has created an Oscar

779
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Shoe business

780
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
For himself over here

781
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,928
And that's what he tried to do with qanon to with Zack

782
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
These days

783
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:36,096
It's it's the story of long-form improv and how Upright Citizens Brigade

784
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Here

785
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
Know what it is

786
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Anyway

787
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
Jim Garrow here

788
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Before we do

789
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
Alex has a bit of breaking

790
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
News

791
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Vex

792
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
Is disturbing January 30th 2013

793
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
What's happening in the

794
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
Okay that sounds good

795
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
10 +

796
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
Pretty messed up

797
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
You can't do that

798
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
I don't I don't know what you can and can't do I don't really know where the line of legality

799
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
In terms of making

800
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,848
Claims but that seems pretty close to it

801
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
Auto killing cancer cells with a homeopathic

802
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Galaxy

803
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,463
Cuz you just reading a press release about one of the sponsors asserting that their product has a health benefits

804
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
The FDA hasn't evaluated

805
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
It hasn't been proven

806
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
How to cure your cancer

807
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
He's just reading a press release that heavily implies it

808
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
And that might be legal

809
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
I'm not sure

810
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Yeah

811
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
Whataburger

812
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Even if

813
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,783
Screw if a doctor prescribed

814
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,159
Tangy Tangerine Beyond Tangy Tangerine I would suck

815
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Punch him

816
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Is it Beyond

817
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:43,071
Tiny describing the Tangerine or is it Beyond a Tangy Tangerine

818
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
A good question

819
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
What's modifying what how far away is

820
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,079
Aransas Pass

821
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,919
Illegally is uncertain

822
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Is a deeply

823
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Deeply on app

824
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
To be doing and he rather

825
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Reasons why

826
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
First youngevity is one of Alex's primary sponsor

827
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
Financial interest in over selling a product

828
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,767
Has been done this product

829
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,119
He's the last person who should be covering that story

830
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Send a text

831
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Two-story away from the context of beings

832
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Mysterious

833
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
Analysis

834
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
Atlantic directly in paid advertisement

835
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
If you were youngevity

836
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
And you're serious about this study

837
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
You would never want Alex reporting on

838
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,503
You do not want him being the person to convey this message

839
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Second

840
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,111
I think they don't care youngevity that is

841
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
Cuz I don't think they're serious about the study

842
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,767
The press release that Alex's reading is from ATL International

843
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Which might sound like a scientific

844
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Research group

845
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
Actually just youngevity parent

846
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Thought

847
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,727
In June 2013 they just decided to change their name to youngevity International

848
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
National that's that's most of what they're busy

849
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,919
This is youngevity putting out a press release hyping her own products and having their pitchman Alex

850
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Yeah

851
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Next

852
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Presenting

853
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
Clemson University

854
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
If legit

855
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Really do that research

856
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Search technically

857
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
It came out of the Clemson University in

858
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
Attitude of nutraceutical research

859
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
The kind of open

860
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Open question

861
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
Even knows what it means

862
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
It's a little vague

863
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
Nutraceutical

864
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Research

865
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
Covid-19 results on the first page of a Google Search for The Institute of nutraceutical research at Clemson University

866
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,343
You find a Facebook page for The Institute has no followers and no post

867
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,927
One amateur slideshow presentation about the Institute

868
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:51,327
7 links to stories about the youngevity story

869
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Probability that

870
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Straight up

871
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,959
It's it it's a red flag the fact that all of this is

872
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,543
It all seems to lead back to this

873
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
The Institute of Medical Research does definitely

874
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
As you can

875
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
The third page

876
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:12,063
Results

877
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,439
But the difference between the other ones

878
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
A review

879
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
It's slightly different

880
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
In 2016 Michelle Van Etten

881
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
Was announced to be a speaker at the Republican National

882
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,959
Conventions

883
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
This led to some people in the media taking notice and ask

884
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
If you question

885
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,359
One of which was about this study that youngevity

886
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
He's made a big part of their bark

887
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Come out with her neck

888
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,319
So The Daily Beast reached out to Clemson spokesperson Robin

889
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,135
To get some sense of what was up with this year's what they had

890
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
3 eggs

891
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,743
Cheaper than dirt

892
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
Nutraceutical research

893
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
Preliminary laboratory research

894
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
For youngevity several years ago

895
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
No clinical trials

896
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:05,055
Performed the Clemson has endured endorsed any youngevity products nor authorized

897
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Or data in conjunction with any claims

898
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Efficacy

899
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
The insta

900
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
No longer

901
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
This is a real problem

902
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Because the website

903
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Infowars

904
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
Team Alex's multi-level marketing operation

905
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
They just reposted Al International press release in full and it literally says that they did quote

906
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Research studies

907
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Which they did.

908
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
This is a misrepresentation on its face

909
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,543
And it's probably illegal for that one feels pretty close to

910
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,103
In the post on Infowars TV claims

911
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
Study showed that Beyond Tangy Tangerine quote

912
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,783
Killed 60% of cancerous colon cells 65% of cancers liver and stomach cells

913
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,087
And 30% of cancerous breast

914
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
While their other product ultimate

915
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:57,535
Quote killed 95% of 5% of cancers

916
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
65% of cancerous

917
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
It's 30% of cancerous breast

918
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
And they didn't know trial

919
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,335
Weather clinical trials

920
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Cuz that brings into

921
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
Which is very questionable

922
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
Cancer cells

923
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
One of those shooting targets

924
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,183
And they realize that they put holes

925
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Yeah

926
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,679
And specifically didn't do any tests on human

927
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
Did that for a reason

928
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:49,247
Studies have been done on cells in test tubes at find that everything

929
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
Strawberries grapes Rosemary

930
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
This is true in test tubes

931
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,719
But has literally no application towards whether they have any

932
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Similar effect

933
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
When taken by a person

934
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,607
One block I found describe the study if they put it this way

935
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
Bleach kills cancer cells in a

936
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Beach

937
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
This is the sleight-of-hand of a study light

938
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
The Institute of nutraceutical research

939
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
There's knew before they started

940
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,175
What the outcome was likely to be

941
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
Get similar results with

942
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Clinical trial

943
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
Which really makes the smell like research

944
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,647
For hire somebody Hallmarks

945
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,975
You paid for this study in order to get the thing you needed

946
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Yeah this is climate

947
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
Paid for by

948
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
What are any number of b*******

949
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Feels right

950
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
Did the Koch brothers pay for the study to

951
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Dr. Wallach is not

952
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,919
Whatever the

953
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
Weather

954
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,759
She was paid to deliver a meaningless study for youngevity

955
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
Free to lie about it.

956
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Matter to me

957
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
What Alex is doing on air regarding this study is

958
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:58,879
Deeply enough

959
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
He's selling false hope to his listener

960
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
As opposed to other

961
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
Lake Winnie

962
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
Some pills to give them virility

963
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
Free just a placebo effect

964
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Casella dump

965
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
But with Beyond

966
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,031
It might kill your cancer cells

967
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
Level There's an actual underlying

968
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Condition here

969
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Superbad

970
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
If this isn't illegal

971
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Man I think it should be

972
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
He's probably

973
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:35,999
And I know that the source of it is a l International and youngevity I'm keenly aware of that

974
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,559
But Alex is disseminating the best

975
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
And I think that that

976
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
I told the wrong side of the law

977
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
10 billion dollar

978
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
There's no way we would

979
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
So

980
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
That isn't that is messed up

981
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,527
I'm not

982
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
Duffy's happy

983
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
A piece of Alex's advertise

984
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,439
He has Jim Carroll they're talking about this

985
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,743
Does litmus test for soldiers

986
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
There's no real new information

987
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
The girl has to say is that

988
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
The guy

989
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
He spoke to

990
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
Talk to him again and the guy said thank you

991
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:23,359
Preston Ford

992
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
I think about that girls like

993
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
I admire him. Getting

994
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,295
Deeper into it

995
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,111
There's there's a part with these Khan's people

996
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
Seem to really

997
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,695
Really like overcomplicating

998
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
It isn't real impulse

999
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
Gilding the lily

1000
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
I do not want to add layers

1001
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,879
Any further action will just lead people to realize

1002
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,183
I'm claiming to run a child traffic

1003
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,767
I don't want I don't want the law enforcement

1004
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
Volver

1005
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:18,911
Apparently I accidentally claimed I was committing a

1006
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
A very large International big clarification it wasn't

1007
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
He brags about it

1008
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Yeah because he's not actually do

1009
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Subway

1010
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
Maybe just didn't realize that what he was

1011
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Scribing was a

1012
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:41,695
No one knows but you don't know what I'm doing like in the orphanages because

1013
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
F****** illegal

1014
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,071
He's very aware that what he claims to be doing

1015
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
Deeply illegal

1016
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,423
Only illegal in China

1017
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Sure

1018
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
A special shout-out to Larry neck

1019
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,047
Never going to get over that ever

1020
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,447
They're having this interview and there's nothing really new common from it there's nothing that interesting

1021
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
The end of the

1022
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,823
Talk forever very long conversation

1023
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:34,175
No really really kind of Alex

1024
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
A buildup

1025
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
Any kind of

1026
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,527
More information training pull door

1027
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,367
Threads out of him

1028
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Like trying to get

1029
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,975
Trying to get Garrett

1030
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
But he doesn't

1031
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,095
Episode they start taking calls Alex wants to

1032
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
To talk to military and police

1033
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,447
Get the call from a Marine

1034
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
And Alex asked

1035
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
But he's been told to shoot on civilian

1036
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
Oh

1037
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
Yeah he was information

1038
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
And this is

1039
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Not

1040
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,671
I got a

1041
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,303
Recent survey dropped in my email I haven't opened it yet but a couple my phone ringtone

1042
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
They said there's some sketchy stuff in there about

1043
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,799
I haven't opened it yet but

1044
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Eminem

1045
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Go home and open it

1046
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
Mailman

1047
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,087
Alright City High

1048
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Hey if it wasn't even if it wasn't even man

1049
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:05,055
Email that you are optionally as to fill out

1050
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Going on there

1051
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,871
Hugh doesn't want to disappoint

1052
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,175
Yeah yeah yeah

1053
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
And he doesn't want to be the person know

1054
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,391
Is no butt

1055
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:24,767
Then I heard it might have something to help you out

1056
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
I really want there's there's a codependency

1057
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
They don't realize it

1058
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Abusive

1059
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
He's you gaslighting writ large

1060
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,151
The 30th

1061
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Dogshit episode

1062
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Real boring

1063
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
That really

1064
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
Got me

1065
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Got me going

1066
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,623
Here on the 31st

1067
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Finishing up

1068
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
January

1069
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:58,815
January fireworks

1070
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,911
But they're not that great though the kind of fireworks are parents will allow you to

1071
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Sparklers

1072
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,287
Maybe a Roman Candle

1073
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,895
But it's at we start here with Alex

1074
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,175
Talking to Paul Jones

1075
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Watson

1076
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
And he's bringing up those

1077
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
Tax

1078
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:23,135
The color called a couple days ago and told him he found

1079
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
And he was afraid for his life

1080
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,487
Yeah it's a sin to Alex call Joseph

1081
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Over these

1082
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
He's deemed them to be

1083
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Credible

1084
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Now

1085
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
If you listen to this clip

1086
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Alex has fully whitewashed

1087
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
Where he got

1088
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
The emails

1089
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
So it's no longer a caller told me about these things that you found on 4chan

1090
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,767
Pjw put out a report by the world the World by storm

1091
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Information

1092
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:07,423
If you had listened to the episode when that caller called in

1093
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
You wouldn't know that's where Alex got this

1094
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Information

1095
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
You might assume that it's

1096
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Some sort of intelligence stores

1097
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
You might assume the Paul Joseph Watson is a great

1098
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Investigative reporter

1099
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
You're wrong

1100
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
You're wrong about all this

1101
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,319
Food

1102
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,927
Some dumb dumb who's hanging out on 410 told Alex about it now

1103
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Here we are

1104
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
So it is in this next clip we hear Alex

1105
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Expressing something

1106
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
Is very interesting

1107
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
Given the present day

1108
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
Kind of aware that

1109
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
The document document

1110
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,519
And in that leak or that hack

1111
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:48,639
That talked about Volkswagen.

1112
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
He seems to know that's fake

1113
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,223
But where he goes from that

1114
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Wild

1115
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,159
Responded

1116
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
Thousands of documents

1117
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,143
Passport

1118
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,591
Where they're discussing a stage

1119
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:22,431
Which is better

1120
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
Qatar

1121
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
Sounds like something the Russians would do Alex

1122
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,423
Interesting

1123
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,223
About president

1124
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:01,087
Tune on the things that Russia might do

1125
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
For political purposes

1126
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,951
Sophisticated

1127
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Through certain channels

1128
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:12,607
In 2013

1129
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,679
I can't I can't think of any real-world parallel to that

1130
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
That's interesting

1131
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Interest

1132
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,079
About the the

1133
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
There's not

1134
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
Not a lot.

1135
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687
Other than Alex

1136
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
Being aware

1137
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,575
There are people who are saying the document was fake and it is

1138
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
But if it's not

1139
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:42,047
Still operating as if it is even though you saying

1140
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
Sue The Daily Mail

1141
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
Proposing

1142
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
As we as we discussed

1143
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,727
Alex gets to complaining about

1144
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
Regulation

1145
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,567
It's impossible to do business

1146
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Anymore

1147
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Probably one of the worst

1148
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Examples he could

1149
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
You can operate

1150
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,359
This isn't 2013.the two years later today

1151
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Don't have his gold and silver license

1152
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
Revoked by the state of Minnesota

1153
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,991
That a little bit later

1154
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:38,623
But it's just funny to have that be like

1155
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,695
Leica gold operation

1156
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
Regular

1157
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
So

1158
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
Firework

1159
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
February said there was fireworks

1160
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:59,359
Sparklers one of our favorite thing

1161
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
The show

1162
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
Whatever

1163
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,759
Someone who made an album in an album

1164
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Raptors

1165
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
Raptors

1166
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,415
Personal favorite

1167
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,951
Beyond esoteric Alex

1168
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Is fake story

1169
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,399
Oh yeah I love a fake story

1170
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,799
Coming up here in a little bit

1171
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:34,175
First part about a park ranger

1172
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
Big Bend National Park

1173
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
Okay

1174
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,975
Sapulpa

1175
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,535
Does the Hulk work as a park ranger

1176
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:27,167
It's closer to Hulk then Hulk Hogan brother

1177
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
Say hello to you.

1178
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,263
Do you take your vitamins

1179
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,567
Sempre

1180
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,103
Probably

1181
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
So in this neck

1182
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,919
Clip

1183
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Little fake story

1184
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
Bright LOL

1185
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,207
Alex Jones we all get

1186
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,327
What were these other people think

1187
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,887
I don't think they're real first of all

1188
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
Raise a lot of question

1189
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,847
Park ranger

1190
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
Big Ben

1191
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
Here is

1192
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
Is the story about the next one

1193
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
This story did

1194
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
Not happen

1195
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
Is there

1196
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,335
Gorgeous

1197
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,439
It sounds like you were drinking

1198
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Oh yeah

1199
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,223
Universal

1200
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
Your old guys out there

1201
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,863
Girlfriends

1202
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
Not permitted here

1203
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
My dad Mother's Day

1204
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
At the hot springs

1205
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Zithromax

1206
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,319
The ranger trash recycler

1207
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:57,087
Hundred

1208
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:06,303
Nope I don't believe that story at all I believe that probably Alex was drinking in a hot tub

1209
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,167
Hot spring Adventure cop

1210
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,983
Yep

1211
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,823
National Park is an amazing natural wonder

1212
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,127
Unlike enter very romantic

1213
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,943
Rob doing his dad to go to

1214
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:29,855
It's unlike anything else in the country and I can totally understand why Alex loves it so much it makes it a vacation desk

1215
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,671
There really is so much to appreciate their

1216
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,255
Historical value of the Land Park once served as a home

1217
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Four members of the Comanche

1218
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,327
And Mescalero scribe

1219
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
And artifacts of that time could still be found around the park

1220
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,983
The park is home to a bunch of really cool animals like roadrunners in Jackrabbit

1221
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
As well as all manner of cactus

1222
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Wildflower

1223
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
All protected by the status

1224
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,359
Enjoyed

1225
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Is a national park

1226
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
They're gorgeous rock formation

1227
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,199
Kansas waterfalls

1228
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Canyon

1229
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Picturesque

1230
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Used enjoy sunset

1231
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
It's a one-of-a-kind

1232
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,159
Three complete ecosystems in the form of a river mountain

1233
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
Desert

1234
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Each separate from one another

1235
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,535
All-in-one National Park I sent the hammer drop

1236
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,863
Thanks to the federal government that land has remained relatively protect

1237
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,447
For hundreds of thousands of people year to visit

1238
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,775
I think that maybe the trumpet

1239
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Ministration

1240
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Here's the thing

1241
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:27,199
Big Bend in the Rio Grande River

1242
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,015
Park is situated right at said Ben

1243
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,111
You may be aware that the Rio Grande is the technical marker the boundary

1244
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
Between the United States Amex

1245
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,231
So on one side of the river it's the United States

1246
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
Not

1247
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,863
Because of the natural beauty and importance of the area to the ecosystem the land

1248
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,167
Second side of the border is also National Park

1249
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,495
Vanessa

1250
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,335
Xperia a bit complicated from a political

1251
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Perspective

1252
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,687
My feeling is that the only real way to crack down on immigration there would be

1253
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,479
Militarize the National Park

1254
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,831
Which requires development of what are we even really doing

1255
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,743
Show me bring all this up because

1256
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,535
Love's Big Bend National Park

1257
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
He talks about it all the time

1258
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,631
He has tons of stories of being in those hot spring

1259
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
How much he enjoys going hiking in

1260
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,519
That's why it should break his heart didn't 27

1261
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
What Trump was trying to get his border wall

1262
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
Big Bad Wolf

1263
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,639
As many as the place you could

1264
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
Easily build

1265
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,271
The reasoning was that it was a stretch of land along the border that's already owned by the federal

1266
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
So building a wall there wouldn't require using eminent domain

1267
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,903
Which would inevitably lead

1268
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,439
Two drawn-out court cases

1269
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
In order to get any of this wall built

1270
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
Pacifica cheap victory

1271
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,815
To put up the platter

1272
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
Hunza people

1273
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Words

1274
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:55,519
It definitely wouldn't be a pyrrhic victory for the entire United States

1275
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
F****** beautiful

1276
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
Existence

1277
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,759
The proposed border wall would by definition have to run through Big Bend

1278
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,623
National Park delicate ecosystems

1279
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Protective

1280
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,767
One example of this is the Mexican black bear whose population have been blind doing in the 90

1281
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:21,887
50s. Because of the protected land of the park was able to fight off Extinction and repopulate

1282
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,471
A border wall would completely disrupt the Bears migratory pattern

1283
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,519
It could lead to them facing

1284
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,335
And that's just one of hundreds

1285
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
Hundreds of species that would be Rock

1286
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Disruption

1287
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Which

1288
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
Building middle of wood apps

1289
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,599
Marco's preparedness overtired Rangers that quote

1290
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
Many many people who put their pool

1291
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Careers

1292
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
I working out here

1293
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
Preserving and protecting me

1294
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:50,815
Azaria in one Fell Swoop we do all of that with the

1295
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
Does border wall

1296
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,215
It's hard to tell how much would it cost to build a wall or just meant to rile up native is paranoia

1297
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
And up

1298
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
Xenophobia

1299
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
To keep Trump space engage

1300
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,359
But let's leave that aside

1301
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
Alex Jones

1302
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,455
F****** loves Big Bend National Park

1303
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,503
And yet he supports Trump building a wall

1304
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,319
Something that would probably destroy the very hot springs

1305
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
He loves to bathe him

1306
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
He's a stupid racist

1307
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
Monster who's willing to destroy something

1308
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Buggy bug

1309
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
To satisfy his desire to

1310
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
Immigrants and refugees

1311
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,559
Or that desire has blinded

1312
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,607
Dim to the fact the following

1313
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
What destroys

1314
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Are you lost

1315
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,007
I think it's a pretty good microcosm of Alex Jones's Life as a whole

1316
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,591
He used to love his radio show but is blind hatred of the government

1317
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
His Litem to slander murder victims

1318
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
I am lawsuit about that

1319
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:41,247
Become the proverbial

1320
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
Disrupted the

1321
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
The show

1322
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,391
From an external perspective is very little in his public life it doesn't appear to have been

1323
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,719
We we just destroyed as a result of him pursuing its

1324
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Petty hatred

1325
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Far past the point where

1326
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
Any sane person would say

1327
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
Destructive consequences,

1328
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
So to put this morning

1329
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Succinctly

1330
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191
Alex Jones dachshund is a total idiot

1331
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,287
And conversely National Park Rule and we need to do everything we can to protect

1332
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Yes

1333
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
It was a little bit more poetic

1334
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:19,135
Also small Point illegal border crossings in the Big Bend area are absolutely not

1335
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
Concern for what

1336
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:25,535
They're talking about building a wall

1337
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
But in between

1338
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
100 book

1339
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,911
On either side

1340
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
A2000

1341
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,983
3 study by Department of Justice

1342
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,287
Explicitly says that the

1343
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,103
About people who cross the border in Brewster county

1344
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
The county where Big Bend Park is low

1345
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,783
Crossing through Big Bend National Park Austin die from lack of water

1346
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Or exposure to the elements

1347
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,671
According to the County Sheriff's Office their bodies are not found until the remains of skeleton

1348
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,743
In terms of any crime of its

1349
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:59,071
Described in that report about the immigration patterns

1350
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,607
What are the main things

1351
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
Brewster county

1352
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,959
Is Poke real burglary

1353
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,287
That's a crime that they have to be concerned about there

1354
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,591
A county official had this to say about that

1355
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
People break into my house

1356
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
Get something to eat when I'm not home wash the dishes and leave them by the sink with a few pesos

1357
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
Better than when you found it

1358
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
Break again

1359
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,023
Food leaving the couple

1360
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,119
By the way that's not in the 19

1361
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,679
That was a 2003

1362
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,775
That that report

1363
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:47,455
Amanda another official had this to say in the report the she said

1364
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,479
Stocked with food

1365
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,807
And quote if people come needing food I filled my foreman to give it

1366
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
There is a

1367
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
Real strong sense that the people in this County

1368
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
Don't see immigration

1369
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
I'm coming through as a victim

1370
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,375
There isn't a ton of it a lot of people who come through end up dying because of a desert

1371
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,679
Cross through

1372
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,239
And they are more interested in helping

1373
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
People not die

1374
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,823
Then they are with whatever Alex's

1375
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,383
Concerns are criminalizing

1376
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,407
Helping people

1377
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,087
What how many you people have been arrested

1378
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Charged with

1379
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
Only 1%

1380
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,975
Enforcement budget

1381
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
Brewster county

1382
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,071
How do I to do with undocumented

1383
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,399
So you're saying that they aren't using Brewster's Millions

1384
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:42,751
The county had to pay four times as much for autopsies and burials of

1385
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
Bodies of undocumented immigrants

1386
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
They found in the

1387
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,871
The county

1388
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
So I think is loaded

1389
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,967
Metallica spit

1390
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:56,831
Also this is going to drift into a bit of trivia

1391
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,391
County to Brewster county

1392
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,719
Jeff Davis County

1393
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Confederacy

1394
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,143
That's wonderful yeah parently guess what that's one of four counties

1395
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,191
The country they're named after Jefferson Davis

1396
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
All of them

1397
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
In Georgia Tech

1398
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
This Mississippi

1399
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
And Jefferson Davis

1400
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
Parish in Louisiana

1401
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:24,991
Realize that was f***** up

1402
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,271
Back in 18th

1403
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
9

1404
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,111
23 counties in Texas or proxy

1405
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
10% of the County's

1406
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:38,047
In the entire State Brewster county

1407
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,607
Percy Brewster who was a colonel in the Confederate Army

1408
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
It's not so easy to find counties named after abolitionist

1409
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Georgia likes

1410
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,775
The claim that Douglas County was named after

1411
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Frederick Douglass

1412
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
That's technically true

1413
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,639
What it was named after him in eight

1414
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
County with

1415
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,991
Confederate Democrats

1416
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,807
Power in the government change the name of the county

1417
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,599
It's still called Douglas

1418
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,903
But now it's spelled with one less f

1419
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,695
In honor of Stephen Douglas

1420
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
Illinois politician who ran against

1421
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Lincoln for president

1422
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,583
And supported slavery is being protected by state

1423
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
Right

1424
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:16,447
Douglas literally believe that the Declaration of Independence only applied to White

1425
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:21,055
People saying this government was made by our fathers on the

1426
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,919
Made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever

1427
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
So that's that

1428
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
Just a little bit of

1429
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,295
Pull back the curtain

1430
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Oh

1431
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
Cool

1432
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,975
That's not cool changing the name from

1433
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,791
Frederick just removing an ass and then being like

1434
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
Guess what

1435
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,119
Instead of Frederick Douglass

1436
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:51,519
Let's call it Strom Thurmond County for Christ

1437
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,335
So we know

1438
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Accept

1439
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,967
So anyway I started out with Alex telling a fake story about going to Big Bend

1440
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
Run-in with imaginary police

1441
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,367
And then we realized

1442
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
Sports politician

1443
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
That Park destroyed

1444
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,303
If sex with Alex pretends

1445
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,327
To cry about

1446
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
This time it's Big Ben

1447
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,263
Cuz the park later

1448
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,599
Anymore

1449
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:42,719
Okay

1450
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:47,071
You forget you forget depaul's been on hold this whole time

1451
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,959
Search up with Syria talking about those fake documents

1452
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:02,431
Asad burning and murdering thousands upon thousands of his

1453
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,527
I knew we were food let's get out of here

1454
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
What year

1455
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Scribing

1456
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,903
When you talkin about being food

1457
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Is

1458
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
Getting a ticket

1459
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,767
For drinking somewhere that drinking isn't allowed

1460
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,071
Yeah that's an open container violation

1461
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
That you're on Federal

1462
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,191
That's Federal property it's the park

1463
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,751
If they say there's no drinking

1464
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
That's the rules

1465
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,335
We could do you drink at the courthouse

1466
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,895
Just a hangout

1467
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Do the 40

1468
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,687
At the courthouse

1469
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,967
It's not going to fly

1470
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,295
No I did meet a guy who did some coconut court house one time

1471
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
And that's

1472
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,647
Is he ate well and that's during his trial for cocaine

1473
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
But I bet it wasn't like

1474
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,767
Make a show of it

1475
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
Yeah

1476
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:54,143
Implies something worse than

1477
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
Or maybe a

1478
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
Small citation

1479
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:01,055
I mean if you were drinking a Coors

1480
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
The hot spring

1481
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,919
I'm sure someone will come over like a pour that out

1482
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,831
The first time that a park ranger

1483
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
And throw it away

1484
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
Don't litter

1485
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
More less

1486
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,999
So or he also would have done

1487
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,071
I've no sympathy for Alex

1488
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
Overhyping

1489
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
So does victimhood agree

1490
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,495
Mentality

1491
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
As it relates to

1492
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
Then I would love to be in right now

1493
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,039
I don't feel like a gift shops

1494
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,415
Why would you want to be outdoors

1495
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,231
I don't know what it is about parks that gets

1496
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:58,143
No I know I get it I'm looking at me like I'm

1497
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,471
I don't know I don't know

1498
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
I do like going to a national park

1499
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,335
Little Wok

1500
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Alright whatever

1501
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,039
So it is next Quest

1502
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
Larry Pratt

1503
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
From God orders

1504
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
Who is

1505
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,231
If it's next clip though

1506
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:28,095
It's clear that bragging about his appearance

1507
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,399
But also Larry Pratt has been on

1508
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
They got you a little bit of a fight

1509
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,543
But apparently has been boosting

1510
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
The membership rolls

1511
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Applications

1512
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
For gun owners

1513
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
America

1514
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
Clip Larry Pratt

1515
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Piers Morgan

1516
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,551
In a Morgan blessings pretty card

1517
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Did a little bit it is very here too

1518
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,207
Increase our membership and we're very grateful

1519
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,743
Piers Morgan

1520
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
I think I'm

1521
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,095
Grateful enough to form a fan club

1522
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:09,823
He helped our membership and the NRA's membership

1523
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,919
We may look back and say

1524
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
What he started

1525
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,087
During your truly about how the United States Auto operate

1526
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,391
Supercilious

1527
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
British accent of his

1528
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,975
That just kind of

1529
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,047
Kills most Americans right up to the gag

1530
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,447
Highlights of very important things people need to realize

1531
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,495
Correctly use the word supercilious

1532
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:44,895
And confuse Alex

1533
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
Conform

1534
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,807
The thing that's important is that

1535
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
These people

1536
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,671
I'm going to go ahead and call Larry Pratt fashion

1537
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,975
For a specific reason

1538
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
I will get you in a moment

1539
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,303
When you have people like this

1540
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,583
Who have nefarious in

1541
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,911
If you allow them access to your plants

1542
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
If you don't

1543
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Be very careful with it

1544
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
You help

1545
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,080
Is expressing

1546
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,944
We use Piers Morgan is it useful idiot

1547
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,296
He didn't understand the game we were playing we played the game

1548
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
You know there's a fight

1549
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
We won

1550
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,416
Is what happened

1551
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
Where you don't push back

1552
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
Is because

1553
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,072
He was at the Rocky Mountain rendezvous

1554
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,424
Advocate

1555
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
All those folks back in

1556
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,056
Larry OG

1557
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
So

1558
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,872
For whatever

1559
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
Legitimate second

1560
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Defense

1561
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Arguments

1562
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,296
Behind that that is far darker

1563
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
Even if

1564
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
Even if he doesn't

1565
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
Express outright whites

1566
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
Supremacy India

1567
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,560
Very very very

1568
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,912
Elbows

1569
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,776
Recurring theme in America

1570
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Is that

1571
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
The left

1572
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
Piers Morgan

1573
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Gun movie

1574
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
People do boat

1575
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:36,256
More infuriating

1576
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
But what's a common recurring theme is that

1577
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:46,752
They're playing a different game and nobody

1578
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
You think

1579
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
You're playing one game

1580
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
Playing that game

1581
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,664
We were even really all that aware of that no

1582
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
Spending this much time

1583
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,992
Looking at deconstructing

1584
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
The Alex

1585
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
And his associates

1586
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Folks

1587
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,184
I really I don't I don't think we would be aware of that

1588
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
If it wasn't for deep

1589
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
Immersion

1590
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,792
And that's a lot of people

1591
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,632
It's it's so much easier with social media

1592
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
Easier

1593
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,752
Capitalizing

1594
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
Quick attention

1595
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,056
Expand

1596
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Social media

1597
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
Well that's just even more obvious

1598
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
In the context of

1599
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
McConnell

1600
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
Supreme Court

1601
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,880
That people calling him hip-hop hypocritical

1602
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
He's always been

1603
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Is this is

1604
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,024
Consistent fact he was full of s***

1605
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
He's full of s***

1606
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,912
He's playing better than

1607
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,960
Autocracy

1608
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,520
See play into his other team

1609
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,872
It's a charge that won't get you where you need

1610
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
To go

1611
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,200
Because anybody

1612
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Vet

1613
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
McConnell isn't bored

1614
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,552
Isn't going to be convinced

1615
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
Spy accusation

1616
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Apocracy

1617
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
Because they see the autocracy

1618
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Lesbian

1619
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Affect

1620
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:18,656
And people who were playing that other game understand what accusation

1621
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
AR

1622
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,520
Define impotent to hurt.

1623
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:29,920
Not even just not impotent but almost a rallying cry as well

1624
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,712
You criticize or you can wink

1625
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,600
Hypocrite

1626
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,904
Everybody was like hahaha of course you would

1627
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,952
Because everybody knew of course he would

1628
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,792
If somebody said to me

1629
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,328
When McConnell was

1630
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Pulling that b******* with garlic

1631
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
That

1632
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,168
It was just like

1633
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,728
Well you know what at least he'll be ideologic

1634
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
Consistent and if I eat Supreme Court

1635
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
She opens up and

1636
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Election year

1637
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,360
I'm sure he'll do the same thing

1638
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,896
I would have wanted to punch them

1639
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
So heartbeat

1640
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,712
Obviously

1641
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
So

1642
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
We get to finally something about Saint

1643
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
How do you hook your on January 30th

1644
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,720
Much talk about it further reinforces

1645
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
My sorta feeling Metallica

1646
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,448
Call are called

1647
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,984
Alex

1648
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
I really care about you

1649
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,896
Emotional level doesn't really care

1650
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
About Sandy Hook

1651
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,200
He's interested in

1652
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:41,856
The opportunism of the conspiracy theory Community that's growing around it but it doesn't really

1653
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
Really care that much

1654
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,440
So he doesn't talk about it

1655
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
A lot

1656
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
But he has this

1657
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Bit of news

1658
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
But he's coming to

1659
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
Wholesale

1660
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
My response that is okay

1661
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,256
Let's get those choirs

1662
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,304
Yeah I don't deserve

1663
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Was that

1664
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
I don't know it's very

1665
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
It's strange

1666
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,168
Just a way of trying to

1667
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,704
Whataboutism

1668
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:11,456
Yeah one from all-time and other countries and everywhere around the world

1669
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:15,040
If you do one example

1670
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
Real

1671
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
Consequences

1672
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:31,680
Does bulshit but everybody do the cloward-piven approach to publicize

1673
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,704
Victims of gun violence

1674
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,776
And I think Alex would have a new complaint

1675
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,056
Did you get that witches like

1676
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,944
It's somehow still not to address

1677
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
The central issue

1678
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,576
Interesting about this is that

1679
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
Conspiracy

1680
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
I don't know what Alex

1681
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
Fight 1

1682
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
Tracy was putting

1683
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,328
Was that some of the children who have died

1684
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,120
In the shooting were actually sing

1685
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
At the Super Bowl

1686
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,680
That becomes

1687
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Large

1688
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,544
Conspiracies Alex

1689
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
Mad about

1690
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,640
Choir singing at the Super Bowl

1691
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
His

1692
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Because that doesn't

1693
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,760
Seem to be present what are you saying here

1694
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
But we're still a little ways off

1695
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,344
From the actual

1696
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,024
Describing your level of

1697
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
Stupidity to your end

1698
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888
Just sew on

1699
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,960
Houses

1700
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Morphs

1701
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:44,128
Like does Alex pick up on any of them

1702
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
It's kind of tough

1703
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:48,736
To find an angle on it other than what he's already said

1704
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Get those kids from

1705
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
Schools in Mexico

1706
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:55,648
Cuz I think mostly will be like you bet

1707
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:03,328
Really terrible arrangement of Ave Maria

1708
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:04,864
I think that's how he's going to

1709
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:11,520
I mean if he wants to go for that then Larry Nichols album

1710
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
Super Bowl

1711
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:16,384
That's right next to your quickie survives will get him

1712
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,712
I think it's also super weird that Larry Nichols hasn't

1713
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,528
I'm showing up at all in this 2012

1714
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,856
That's true hasn't shown up at all

1715
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
I really expected

1716
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,648
Show up

1717
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
Psyop

1718
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:35,072
A lot more in the last 3 or 4 days that I've been listening to

1719
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,912
So you put around the corner

1720
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,448
But it is a word

1721
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
Associated

1722
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:45,824
No it's really weird you'd expect a lot more of these like regular people

1723
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,640
Back to business

1724
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,200
A whole month in the week

1725
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
I'm about to have almost that I've listened to

1726
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
12 2013

1727
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,600
Anza

1728
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Nothing

1729
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Not really

1730
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,440
Just gun dudes

1731
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
Just Larry Pratt

1732
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,792
Stewart Roads from The Oath Keepers

1733
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,544
Bulshit made-up bulshit

1734
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,848
But we are

1735
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
Tear that's very familiar to us

1736
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
Alex is Scream

1737
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
But Financial

1738
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
And then

1739
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,040
Most predictable thing ever

1740
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,696
Okay

1741
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,192
I wasn't drinking

1742
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:22,592
You're drinking right that's what you're doing here

1743
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Yeah

1744
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:34,368
Now you can just not said that

1745
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,392
Cuz I was a bad news

1746
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,184
Bob Chapman died in

1747
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,232
2012 so he's already

1748
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,144
The shortcut

1749
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,424
Does Nepal Chapman

1750
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,752
Straight shooter

1751
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,336
I haven't really come up in this 2012.

1752
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,712
I thought that it

1753
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,088
It's only interesting

1754
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
He showed up

1755
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,880
A lot

1756
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,952
So now for years later

1757
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
I think it's also probably partially because

1758
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
You taking on like

1759
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,144
Thibiant

1760
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,984
Doesn't have

1761
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
As much

1762
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
Central importance

1763
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
Yeah

1764
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Anymore

1765
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,872
ATL to Cortez crankbaits

1766
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Weird device

1767
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
Right

1768
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
You know

1769
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,928
Know what to do

1770
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,952
And tell so

1771
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,232
And he's all out of

1772
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:49,888
That's very old

1773
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,752
Other gold companies

1774
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,312
Running ads on Glenn Beck

1775
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:00,384
And Rush Limbaugh

1776
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,432
Negative

1777
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,480
He's having Alex to it

1778
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,784
That's for sure.

1779
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:47,744
What

1780
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,048
What

1781
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,944
Lights on

1782
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:17,184
Free

1783
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
Butler

1784
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:25,632
Differentiating

1785
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,256
And and

1786
01:33:55,328 --> 01:34:01,472
Need to know two years later earlier

1787
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:06,336
We talked about it on the show before but it's worth

1788
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
Indicates out

1789
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:12,992
Michonne is one of his biggest sponsors through Midas resources he's no longer legally allowed to sell precious metals

1790
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:18,112
About to come out with the state of Minnesota and they revoked

1791
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:24,000
Because he quote misappropriated customers money and misrepresented terms of sale to them

1792
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,816
Resources quote route

1793
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,400
Without prior agreement

1794
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,984
To deliver with customers

1795
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,800
And otherwise misrepresented to cost

1796
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,336
Tomorrow's the terms of sale

1797
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,408
He was kicked out the precious metals business and had to pay

1798
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:44,480
Payback hundreds of thousands of dollars to customers

1799
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,248
Andres tattoo

1800
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,040
Ted Anderson is running

1801
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,344
Shady as s*** gold company

1802
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:53,440
Hard to swallow

1803
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:56,768
Complain about some other gold company running ads on trust

1804
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,328
Or Glenn Beck show with markups that offended

1805
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,864
Grateful

1806
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,192
He is doing this I don't know why you doing

1807
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
It's just

1808
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,520
Shading the competition you know

1809
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,176
It's one of these things like if you're working with this like

1810
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,224
Tammy f****** gold operation

1811
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
Don't call other gold operations

1812
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,552
Amy

1813
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,344
That's going to draw attention to house

1814
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Amy you are

1815
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,952
A dino that apparently in practice it doesn't work that way

1816
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:35,168
The exact opposite of the way the world works if you're running a scam accuse everyone

1817
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,288
That's weird literally to get elected president

1818
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,080
It's so weird that the world works that way

1819
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
It just seemed like that

1820
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:52,576
Hillary

1821
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,744
You're interested it is a gold

1822
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,328
What is really about is

1823
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,376
Condemn these other companies

1824
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
For being shady

1825
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,216
As a way of making

1826
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Sure that people

1827
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
Trust Ted

1828
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,128
Making them look bad is in service of building up Ted's credibility

1829
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
As you can hear it

1830
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,440
This resources

1831
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:01,952
Resources

1832
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,024
Tell me he's even saying it like this is a business

1833
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,072
It's full of f****** shady

1834
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,632
People but

1835
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:13,984
5% markup

1836
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,544
He just wants to get you the best deal

1837
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,896
That's f****** used car salesman ship but for gold

1838
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,760
Just see within a couple days spam

1839
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,296
This kind of

1840
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,856
Shilling for persons gold

1841
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,160
The youngevity

1842
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
Can cure cancer study

1843
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,232
You just got like

1844
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
Roast

1845
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:41,888
Rose business model here

1846
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Even give a s***

1847
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,240
So we have one more clip here

1848
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
And

1849
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,104
In terms of this clip it's wise to remember

1850
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
That

1851
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
After Alex had

1852
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
James Trace

1853
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
The guy who

1854
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,296
After he had him on the show

1855
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:04,416
There was a video that got 10 million views on YouTube about those

1856
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464
He started

1857
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
To change the way

1858
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
Covered thing

1859
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,072
Particularly school shooting

1860
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,632
We saw the Lone Star College shooting

1861
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,936
Where he was

1862
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,960
Was covering things up

1863
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,056
Find a false-flag angle on it

1864
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,432
Many realize that the school was pretty much decided it was

1865
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
Right

1866
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,992
Now on the 31st

1867
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
Right at the end

1868
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,784
The show there's another

1869
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Here is how I would

1870
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,048
Middle School

1871
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,096
14 year old

1872
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,088
Drudgereport.com

1873
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:10,208
Silver dollars for $70

1874
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
Fat

1875
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,656
Disgraceful

1876
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,728
Many many levels

1877
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
F******

1878
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Disgrace

1879
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,080
That's pretty bad

1880
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:31,456
So the story that I was covering hears about a shooting that took place at Price Middle School in Atlanta Georgia

1881
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,248
A fifteen-year-old student

1882
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:38,880
Was shot by a fourteen-year-old

1883
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:42,464
A resource officer at the school was able to get the shooter to drop his weapon

1884
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
He was taking it

1885
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,608
That Alex was so quick to decide that this was a gang related

1886
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,656
Well I'm sure it has nothing

1887
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,704
To do with it Lana being black maca

1888
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:58,080
So I could Price Middle School as a student population that's a 95

1889
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:03,456
Percent black probably a coincidence

1890
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,064
In February police would come out and say that they are investigating a gang and go to the shooting

1891
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,856
Information wasn't

1892
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,672
Mr. shooting is not even really being worth covering

1893
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:18,816
I can find zero confirmation or details about the conclusion that it will

1894
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,120
But even if the police are a hundred percent

1895
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Correct

1896
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,424
Suggested that this could be

1897
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,216
The result of two gangs fighting

1898
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,496
Doesn't change

1899
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:32,384
I don't particularly trust the flip it definition of the word gang when it's applied to the two black eats by police

1900
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,176
Particularly when it's

1901
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,200
Shoreline

1902
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,992
The details are absent

1903
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,808
And from the reporting of this story even in the articles that I can

1904
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
The victim's mother was

1905
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,416
Publicly very clear that our son wasn't involved

1906
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,184
Banana gang

1907
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,720
And don't want to Legend gang

1908
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,024
Involvement at provided any concrete information

1909
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,840
Plus and most importantly

1910
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,656
Even if this was a gang-related shooting

1911
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,936
It doesn't make Alex

1912
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,032
He had zero reason to assume it was a gang shooting other than

1913
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,568
He saw fit all the students

1914
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,592
That's cool we're black

1915
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,872
This

1916
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,432
The only piece of information he's operating off of

1917
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
Exactly definition

1918
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Cooperating

1919
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,272
Entirely off of racial prejudice

1920
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
Also parents couldn't pick up their kids

1921
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
From the school

1922
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,904
Because they've been evacuated to a nearby Church

1923
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,256
Where they were before they got the whole situation sorted out

1924
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
There's nothing

1925
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Nothing suspicious

1926
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
Just about that at all

1927
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,400
So we can have ears

1928
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
Really care

1929
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
About this

1930
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,152
This would be suspicious

1931
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,200
In a vacuum

1932
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,504
Cliff would be suspicious

1933
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
In a vacuum

1934
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
A b self

1935
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,344
No other contact

1936
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
You like

1937
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,720
Dismiss that story

1938
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
And then sell

1939
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
TARDIS

1940
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,632
Texting is Bond

1941
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:02,496
It is

1942
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
Desire to

1943
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,080
Dismiss this story is gang related

1944
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,616
Did shooting

1945
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,432
But when you take it in the context

1946
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,736
The larger world

1947
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,808
The end of January 2013 Alex

1948
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
Where

1949
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
What's 2

1950
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
Hook Market

1951
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
He wants to find his own

1952
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,536
The General

1953
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:28,608
Narrative offshoot wants to make

1954
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
So he's

1955
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,960
Teresa

1956
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Through

1957
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,288
Using his pan

1958
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,592
Sadtu sister all of the school shooting

1959
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,616
And whenever something

1960
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:46,016
This is the school shooting I don't want so

1961
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,296
Other than

1962
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,648
Breaking news school shooting

1963
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
Oh nevermind

1964
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
Atlanta

1965
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,768
Oh I'm positive what happened

1966
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,328
Is the he got it from the producers

1967
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,912
Big shot over an article to him

1968
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,192
Yep in the photo

1969
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:12,128
Context of this

1970
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,176
Sandy Hook

1971
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,200
Kids to do

1972
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,528
B diss lives in

1973
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,088
And the lone star shooting coverage

1974
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,624
Is the more specific

1975
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,952
When he was covering that

1976
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,768
So excited that it was possibly a fall swag

1977
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:31,072
Did he was going to get the information on

1978
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,608
And when he started to realize

1979
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
This isn't

1980
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,912
And it's all black people

1981
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:40,544
He's like immediately Oz's gang-related yep

1982
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,336
In both of these instances

1983
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,872
It what's the similarity

1984
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,920
Predominantly black schools

1985
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,760
That's how his brain work

1986
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,320
This isn't worth

1987
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,392
Attention is not worth feeling anything about

1988
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:58,208
F*** it it's games

1989
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,256
If somebody in a gang get shot

1990
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,328
It's a gang shooting so

1991
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,864
Hey he definitely does

1992
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
Literally

1993
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
Be right there

1994
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:08,960
So

1995
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
I don't know I mean

1996
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,776
Seizure of this episode

1997
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
Not a ton

1998
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,848
Development

1999
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
Truck stop

2000
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,896
But a lot

2001
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,176
Abrasive

2002
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:21,760
Yep there is a lot of bigotry on here that is

2003
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,320
It's the sort of bigotry that Alex

2004
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,344
Private

2005
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,624
Because it's

2006
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Isn't saying

2007
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,232
I don't know

2008
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,304
Or anything like that

2009
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,840
But it's just as

2010
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,144
Bad it's something profile

2011
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,216
Oh that's that's one version of it absolutely

2012
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
It's Justice

2013
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,592
Is potent is bigger

2014
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,128
Covert

2015
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,456
Because it has that plausible deniability

2016
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,320
So I don't like to see

2017
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,344
See that

2018
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,208
It's so interesting

2019
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,232
Consistent

2020
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,560
You know

2021
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,632
The phobia is not

2022
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
Yeah

2023
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
That's very weird.

2024
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:19,104
I think that's the regular progression

2025
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
A lot of

2026
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,152
These people that

2027
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:25,760
At age they just get add more and more to the list of things they hate

2028
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:30,112
Especially if they're bigots already or shirt or something

2029
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
Things that most people

2030
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,208
Like this

2031
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,280
Wouldn't just by default

2032
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:41,376
You do

2033
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,680
Pennywise

2034
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,960
Will be back

2035
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,240
On Monday

2036
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
I don't know I don't know who I was

2037
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,312
Just made this episode

2038
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,848
Rapist

2039
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,432
There's nothing in it in terms of like what we're looking

2040
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,712
4

2041
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,736
Big giant

2042
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:00,832
There's nothing looking for it

2043
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,624
So much

2044
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,648
Sounds like

2045
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,184
Fraud

2046
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
It's it's

2047
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Free

2048
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,496
It's a bit of a holding pattern that he's in

2049
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,264
In terms of

2050
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,800
Conspiracy infinitives

2051
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:22,848
But it's just

2052
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,384
Full steam ahead

2053
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:27,200
Demonize Obama demonize the last

2054
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,224
Call Fran

2055
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,832
Guns are under threat

2056
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
For the

2057
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,744
Chris's and then he'll really have a twin

2058
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,936
Worries at the pounds is the boss

2059
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
Boston bombing

2060
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,240
You think so I'm worried about

2061
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,288
I don't know if

2062
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,104
Is it yeah

2063
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,200
I'm worried that that's the why he responded so

2064
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,480
Strongly to it

2065
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
Immediate

2066
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,856
Volkswagen everything on air

2067
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,952
It's possible that this is all priming the

2068
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
The pump for that

2069
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Something happen

2070
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:14,816
Before then

2071
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,632
Well there's a while

2072
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,936
