Court document

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448

00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Wrong with you

66
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
Decision

67
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,176
This is now this is eventually just going to turn into wishing well on

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
Thing is I'm thrilled

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
I know

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,392
That's one of the problems I had an amazingly great time reading up on all this stuff

71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
I found is like legitimately

72
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
The horrifying

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
There's individuals that we're going to discuss

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,656
You probably wear of maybe one or two of them

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592

Roosevelt

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
I think it's an accident but I'm not sure

79
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Possibly

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
There's a guy at least one who

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Going to come up

82
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
We all know who he is we heard of them before

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
But then

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Search that I did

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Really highlighted how much

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
The worst of a person he is

87
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Okay that was not fun

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Reading some of the

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
The stories about him

90
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Can think about is you

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
First thought is o.j. for some reason I don't think that's right

93
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
But look

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
I know I'm doing too much

95
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Teasing but we have to start out her episodes as we

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
I'm out of context

00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791

00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863

His lack of preparation

160
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
He doesn't know what he

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Actually

162
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
About to talk about it all

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
It's infuriating it drives me incredibly insane

164
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
But

165
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
So we have the

166
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
This clip

167
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703

171
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Donald Trump

172
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039

173
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Will learn

174
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
But not only is Donald Trump

175
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Being

176
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
Surveilled

177
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279

00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,847
Just just other people say Hansa folks

184
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Note

185
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,783
Although Snowden does get clocked out a little bit in this episode

186
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
So minor compared to what this whistleblowers bring

187
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,231
Alright we're going to dig into every single element

188
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511

189
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327

Two-and-a-half

191
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
23 hours don't end up with everyone who hears this

192
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Realizing that this is nothing

193
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
I will

194
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311

197
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
The only way to go about things honorably

198
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,839
At least come out and say it wasn't true sound like we got them

199
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
Federal Marshals and Topping

200
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
And for a week the media ignored

201
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,599
I also called the phone numbers on there

202
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
Right now

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,703
Trump family

204
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,359
Again that's him reading the link

205
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
I'm not figuring out outside

206
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
I do remember

207
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
Yes where we go to make the movie with The Rock

208
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Can Steve Carell is that right

209
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
I don't know

210
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Yeah with

211
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
That was the old one

212
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
They made a new one

213
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Steve Carell

214
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
I don't think the rock was in it I think I can play at 6

215
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
So on Sunday of last week

216
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
Infowars published they

217
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Believe

218
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Claiming

219
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
A database

220
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Phone numbers

221
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
An address

222
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Right

223
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
And Alex has said

224
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
These were my old phone numbers this is correct

225
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
These are the phone numbers that I have for Donald Trump

226
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
These are real phone number

227
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
But as We Know

228
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
He doesn't know Donald Trump's phone number

229
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Code for the prize you keep saying that

230
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
He's claimed

231
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
But he has multiple phone numbers for Trump

232
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
It falls flat for us

233
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Thompson different area

234
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
He has he has these things that he published

235
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
What's up

236
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Parts you know like you don't want to

237
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,215
Bakery don't want it even if you don't want to

238
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Hunza people

239
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
Klipsch off parts of phone numbers in Wenatchee

240
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
They claim that it was a part of a massive index

241
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
People who were being spied on

242
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
And this is from this whistleblowers

243
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Now

244
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
The problem that we have with that

245
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Is that is

246
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Completely unprovable

247
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
All of this information

248
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Could Have Been Gone by someone who has

249
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
The minimum amount of hacker

250
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Skills

251
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Added willing

252
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
To falsify.

253
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
So keep that in mind as we go for

254
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
Struggling

255
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Anything that Alex posted

256
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
Does not have to come

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
If you posted on the website

258
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Does not have to come

259
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
From

260
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Like an NFA source

261
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
It's all very easily accessible information

262
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Like a lot of information is

263
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Mara Lago

264
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
I could Google that

265
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
I need to print out like a part of the phone book

266
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
I don't think he did I think someone else did and sent

267
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
22mm as evidence of Ali

268
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Okay

269
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
It's not the white papers it's the white pages

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Nailed it nailed it

271
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:06,687
You think about all day

272
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
So this is basically the construction of what

273
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Is going on

274
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
They building the foundation of a lie about

275
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Eli's

276
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Alex

277
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
If using whatever information that he got as evidence that

278
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Spied on

279
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
If using it as evidence that he was right all along

280
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Right

281
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
So on Monday he has an interview with

282
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
A guy

283
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Mike zullo

284
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Okay

285
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
I'm in for what

286
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
So you come back for one last job

287
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Is he is away from retirement please give me some used car dealer

288
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,071
Cars I can tell that's what I found in my

289
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Flight b a

290
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
The research

291
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
About Mike zullo

292
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Necessarily

293
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,311
Alright care about more is that he is

294
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
What former employee

295
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Cuz he's not out of he's not to work

296
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Anymore

297
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Sheriff Joe Arpaio

298
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
He was a member of it and now I think it is time

299
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
To deal a tiny bit with Joe Arpaio

300
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Racist

301
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Garbage

302
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Pile of

303
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Human foxy

304
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,447
Earlier when I said when you look at him

305
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
But even what you just said

306
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
I did not know

307
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Get worse

308
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
So we're going to get to it and

309
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,015
Is going to make the argument

310
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
You think the devil can't go lower but there we go

311
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
The devil also like

312
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
You know cheats

313
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,791
The cards come on

314
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Zulos point

315
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Which is

316
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
When

317
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Joe Arpaio was being

318
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Court

319
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
Making the necessary changes

320
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Insisted that he make

321
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,879
Based on findings that they had racial discrimination

322
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
In the Maricopa County

323
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
Police force he didn't follow

324
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
And then also didn't default telling him

325
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
There were times he was brought in

326
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
2008-2010

327
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
A problem

328
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
He was held in contempt

329
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
Arrested

330
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Left leg cut off

331
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
What should have

332
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
In this court case

333
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
I don't like

334
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,231
He's right legs

335
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Yeah exactly

336
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,095
Argument as he was being

337
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Because being

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Surveilled upon and why

339
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
During that investigation

340
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,407
Cuz I want to give an accurate picture of Joe Arpaio is

341
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
Let's get down to it

342
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Pages

343
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Subway

344
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
One of these

345
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Is disqualifying

346
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
So get ready

347
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Does he say grandpa

348
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
No

349
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,167
Maricopa County in Arizona

350
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Joe Arpaio

351
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
The houses inmates have not believed that they deserve to be inside

352
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Great Arpaio literally described the city as a quote

353
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
That's good

354
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
I like his willingness to embrace

355
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,671
His monstrosity like didn't even bother to call it

356
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
If I could burn you I would

357
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,559
I would totally do that

358
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Blind as I can

359
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
Speaking of burning these inmates

360
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
Please don't say anymore after that on July 2nd 2011 temperatures in Phoenix

361
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Degrees Fahrenheit

362
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,407
Arpaio measured the temperature inside is 145 degrees Fahrenheit

363
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,991
Some inmates complained that their fans near their beds were not working

364
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Heather shoes were melting from the

365
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,415
Cheese's during the summer 2003 with outside temperature 10 degrees Fahrenheit

366
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Arpaio said to complaining inmates

367
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,815
Hit 120° in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn't commit any crimes

368
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
So shut your mouth

369
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Which is

370
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Horrible

371
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,775
How do you do that

372
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
How do you not have any empathy

373
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
In 1997 Amnesty International said arpaio's Tent City Jail is a quote

374
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Humane alternative

375
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Inmates in suitable jail facility

376
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,183
People get mad when you leave a dog in a f****** car

377
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,535
This dude is literally burning people alive in the Desert Sun

378
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
Tent city is criticized by groups

379
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Human and constitutional rights

380
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Implicit in it

381
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
Formation

382
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Yep you at

383
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
You wouldn't do that

384
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,455
His argument is that they're criminals and who cares

385
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
Committed crimes really bad argument

386
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
One of our relations actions was a requirement that inmates wear pink underwear

387
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
In order to prevent it

388
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Released inmates

389
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Which of the stupid rationale

390
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,167
Most harmless thing I've ever heard anybody

391
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
He claims that he has saved the county

392
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
$70,000 into effect

393
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Mankato

394
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Sent more advisor

395
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,271
Customized boxers

396
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
With a Maricopa County Sheriff's logo

397
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
Goat

398
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
As a fundraiser for Sheriff's Association

399
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,767
What's the spike

400
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Arpaio

401
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Declined to provide

402
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Accounting for the money

403
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
He basically use it as a promotional tool

404
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
So so it's so

405
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
With his financial

406
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Close

407
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Together in arms illegal immigration policy to help enforce immigration laws

408
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Posse Posse

409
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Gets worse

410
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
This included

411
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
Steven Seagal and Lou Ferrigno

412
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
No that's better

413
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
I am comfortable with that

414
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
They have guns

415
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
I know that

416
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
That Posse is

417
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
Immune to ninja

418
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,127
That's the first thing we know about that party and then

419
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
If anybody

420
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
Gets really out of control

421
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,343
He's a big green guy

422
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
You would not like me if you're illegal

423
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
Especially not if you're a God

424
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,815
Even close to the tip of the iceberg

425
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Routinely abused child

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,055
Another contaminated food

427
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
How hot is it

428
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Endanger their help

429
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
Denying them care for serious Medical

430
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
Mental Health

431
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,319
And keeping the packets

432
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
Now that's before they've been middle Medieval ages what is f****** happening before they were charged

433
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
That's before they were charged

434
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,679
Pretrial detainees

435
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:01,055
No you should treat you awake

436
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
2010's

437
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Constitutional rights

438
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Vivian Maier

439
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
That should have taken like 20 sack

440
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,391
Under Arpaio the Maricopa County

441
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Multiple times

442
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
In September 2008 the National Committee on Correctional Healthcare accreditation of Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

443
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,400
Office jail for failure to maintain compliance

444
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
Are providing false information about such compliance

445
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
Does that mean people aren't allowed to be

446
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,456
They're not supported by these medical associations that are in charge

447
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
I'm sort of keeping

448
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Track and making sure that jails

449
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
I think that's

450
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
I love though I love their life-saving ability

451
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Like enforcement

452
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
Capabilities but they do have

453
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Like

454
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
When do the finger go to a Goddamn pizza restaurant

455
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,296
Beings to save other human beings lives

456
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Liberals are

457
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,256
Maricopa County

458
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
Are unconstitutional

459
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Play work on it but these are just

460
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Is places

461
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
Although most inmates have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting trial

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
F*** you

463
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
What

464
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
It gets worse

465
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Where is Egypt worth

466
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
Come from it gets worse

467
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
At least

468
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
Ted Bundy was on

469
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Monstrosity

470
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Like I would much rather

471
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Like he's a sociopathic

472
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
It still allowed to roam the

473
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
The streets like you just figure it out

474
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
How to f******

475
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Turn it into a money you like

476
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Turn being

477
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872

478
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
8 *

479
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,040
Arizona

480
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
That's fair

481
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Here's another one for

482
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,768
Under Arpaio the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

483
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
As many as 75% of cases

484
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Navigation

485
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
As I grabbed

486
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
During a three-year period ending in 2007 more than 400 sex crimes reported

487
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
We're providing police services for El Mirage

488
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Arizona

489
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

490
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
Failed to follow through on at least 32 reported child molestation

491
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Jesus f****** why

492
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
In all six cases

493
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
Many many

494
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
We're illegal immigrants

495
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
How do you

496
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Not care about

497
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
I don't know

498
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:20,736
Hey 1999 undercover Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies arrested

499
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Then 18 years old

500
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
And charged with plotting to kill Arpaio with a pipe bomb

501
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,952
A local television station

502
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
A broadcast

503
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

504
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,424
And local television stations

505
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
If they think they're going to scare me away with everything else

506
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
It's not going to bother me

507
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
After spending four years in jail awaiting trial

508
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,408
Seville was about 24 years awaiting trial

509
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
He was about to sign a plea deal that would have sent

510
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
The prison for twenty years

511
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Although he maintained

512
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
He was initially unwilling

513
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
To take a chance on being

514
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
To even longer

515
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
If you work

516
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
However

517
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,144
The former head of undercover investigations for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

518
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
Based on his review of the case

519
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
He felt the civility been in trap

520
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,824
Although it is all but impossible to prove in most jurisdictions

521
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,664
Attorneys eventually discovered that the Maricopa County Sheriff

522
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Detective

523
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
I bought the bomparts themselves

524
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,344
What then convince the bill to build it even though he was not predisposed

525
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
To commit such a crime

526
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,184
On July 9th 22,000

527
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,072
America Copa County Superior Court jury acquitted Seville

00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
1.6 billion dollars

00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Little bit less

537
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
You should have got

538
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
Billion dollar

539
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Yeah

I am

541
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
This is the hardest thing

542
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
I am against the death

00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Like there's no other

In a report

00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
The department concluded the Arpaio oversaw

559
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,600
The worst racial profiling in US history

If you get labeled with that

563
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
In 2015 Arpaio was charged with

564
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
Contempt of court for failing to implement a court

565
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Required changes

A f****** course

570
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,992
He's also publicly promoted the Obama birther

Up to December 2016

Arpaio's office respond

580
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
Fight demanding the mayor's emails and phone log

581
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
Arpaio also had his critics

582
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,296
Maricopa County supervisor

583
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Republican

584
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
To properly discuss

585
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Disclose Business Center

586
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:18,048
Stapley agreed to a 3.5 billion settlement in his lawsuit against Arpaio

587
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Thomas and the county for Folsom

588
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Multiple times

589
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
A suit for it and

590
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
He's cost the county

591
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,824
So many millions of dollars

592
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,128
Because of these illegal tactics

593
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
But he's undergone

594
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,528
4 * has like a runoff election

595
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
In twice

596
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Drop the mic that hit failed both times

597
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
Really

598
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,304

599
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,656

00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
Yeah so you know he's a racist

603
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,200
Is bigot you the awful but it not in jail cuz he argues that he gets results

604
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Wow you committed all the crimes he might be soon

605
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
He should be dead

606
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,256
His argument is that he's Gruff but he gets results but that's not an argument in a case of law

607
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
But also listen to this

608
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:26,144
In 1998 Jordan you're under arrest

609
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912

610
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728

Examine recidivism rate

614
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
It's based on

615
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Conditions of confinement

616
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
So basically like beforehand

617
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
We'll come back supposed to be

618
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Before him and after him

619
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
Under Armour

620
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,704

A1989 290

622
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
Those released in 1994 to 1995

623
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
So what you're saying is that he is both

624
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
A criminal

625
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
A monster

626
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
And it's offensive I get results

627
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Does not actually

628
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
He's a f******

629
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
How can you how could you not

630
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Prosecute

631
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Like there's no

632
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
That you could not put him in jail forever and ever and ever

633
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
And all the lives

634
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
Believe in reincarnation

635
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Nation or ghost

636
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Just so that guy can

637
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Be tortured every moment

638
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
For the rest of f******

639
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm giving you all of this information because the interview that Alex does is with

640
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
This guy's close

641
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,880
Okay. Waterford

642
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232

F****** monster

644
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
We can

645
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Determined

646
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
We're talking to a f******

647
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
He's an evil man

648
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
Here's the situation

649
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,568
There's a lot of really f***** up stuff that you can find out about the history of Joe Arpaio

650
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
Maricopa County Sheriff's Association

651
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
I just got a

652
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
F****** bullet point list of

653
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Absolute

654
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Alderman

655
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Monstrosity

656
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Upon reflection

657
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
Me and Jordan have talked it over and we've decided

658
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
For us

659
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,792
To necessarily be Broadcasting

660
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
I I think

661
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
I think you should

662
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
On your own

663
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
In

664
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Mystical place because

665
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
In a row

666
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Overwhelming

667
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
It shook me

668
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
A good place

669
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,480
Start

670
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
About that you want to go you can find out more about

671
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,928
The depths of the truly irresponsible and evil police work that he

672
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Joe Arpaio

673
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Presided over

674
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Everyone can

675
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Convicted in the nerve

676
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
I genuinely

677
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
I genuinely believe that

678
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Is the sword

679
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Give a moment of silence

680
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,712
Let's get it

681
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:25,344
We will wait for seconds for you and they will kick right back at you

682
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,464
Interview with Mike zullo

683
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512

684
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
One of the higher-ups of the Maricopa County

685
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
Former higher-ups

686
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Does it work Alex

687
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
Does a lot of vampirina

688
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
Accomplice to every single thing the Joe Arpaio

689
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Implicitly signed off by

690
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Supporting him

691
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Still supporting

692
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
Also Alex does a lot of sort of

693
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,904
Opening presentation before he gets to the interview so I can play a couple coats of that

694
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,424
Documents for surveillance

695
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,824
Federal court

696
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,688
Decorated Sheriff patreon

697
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,552
Monster murderer

698
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,648
To try to make up garbage

699
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Yours truly

700
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,512
Isn't that just special

701
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Not particularly

702
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,472
Nope

703
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
Shipping

704
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
I think it was the Red List

705
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
So the argument

706
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
The Blacklist

707
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
I don't know that's why I

708
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,560
Arpaio was

709
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Spider

710
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
This is

711
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Absolute utter nonsense

712
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,336
Why would you need to the secondary argument that he's making is come out with all of these

713
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
All these people

714
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
One of

715
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
The necklace from Mission Impossible

716
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,344
Get The Blacklist on James my reference

717
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,136
A little bit further down the line

718
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
And make sure

719
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:43,072
In a second

720
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
This is where he connect

721
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
What's going on

722
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,728
The Arpaio spying situation

723
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
To what we're going

724
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
We talkin about later

725
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
That involves Trump

726
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Involves Alex

727
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:02,016
Is the guy named Dennis Montgomery who is that nsa's CIA

728
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
I swear to God

729
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Have you seen the movie Zodiac

730
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,952
Yeah have you seen any movie where somebody has a giant

731
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,792
Pinboard with string connect one thing to another

732
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,888
Because it's on your goddamn wall

733
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,704
This one's real simple though it's not a

734
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
I assure you this is not

735
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
Line string that's all we needed for this basic

736
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
They ignored it

737
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,272
Arpaio even harder because

738
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
The Whistleblower

739
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Information

740
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:43,488
So connect everything there this whistleblower question is this guy named Dennis Montgomery

741
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,840
Dennis Montgomery on him now or later

742
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Let's go with

743
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Okay here's a fun one

744
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:01,408
Dennis Montgomery music video compression noise filtering business called

745
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Intrepid technology

746
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
A video

747
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Compression noise filter

748
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
Like a 1998

749
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
Business started out as a tool for the

750
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,184
Casino industry but eventually they sought government

751
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:19,840
In 2014 Montgomery was revealed to be working as a confidential informant

752
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
For Sheriff Joe Arpaio

753
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,424
He claimed that when he was contract

754
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
For the CIA technology

755
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
The government contracts as he was doing

756
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Documents

757
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
The prove the conspiracy

758
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Against Arpaio

759
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
Basically the department of justice under Eric Holder

760
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Was working

761
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
With

762
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
The judge

763
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
In the case

764
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Unopposed

765
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Racial profiling

766
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
I had the document

767
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Sprint just called

768
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
It's not just called

769
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,048
Get like doing conspiracy

770
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Well I mean

771
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Is it just like

772
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,032
But I guess I mean

773
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
You can't man

774
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,640
Conspiracy

775
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Wiretap

776
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,576
The judge

777
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
I mean I also do

778
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
On the table

779
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,352
I don't think it was also

780
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
We know how bad do Joe Arpaio is

781
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Gila monster

782
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,800
Publicity stunts in this 2000

783
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,592
Claim that Montgomery

784
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,736
As the result of Montgomery's investigation is quote

785
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Junk

786
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
So even arpaia fixed

787
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Yep

788
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,280
Come on Alex Jones

789
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
It's just talked to

790
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Alright so he's a vampire

791
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
Mark Mike's

792
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
Zillow

793
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Who is arpaio's

794
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Again

795
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Tears that we

796
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
Heating up

797
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
In elaborate

798
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
And super long introduction

799
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:20,416
On-screen know Jerome corsi

800
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:27,840
If somebody's not looking uncomfortable while Alex Jones is introducing somebody I get real bummed out I'm not joking at all

801
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,496
Trokosi is hanging out

802
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Between Mike zullo

803
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,944
He is there as like a third wheel

804
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Okay

805
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
At this point Alex dropped information that shows

806
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
He doesn't have

807
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
About the situation that he's going to be

808
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
They're the ones that got the documents

809
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
The contractor

810
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Wizard

811
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,632
He doesn't know what to talk about unless this information is sitting right in front of them

812
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Cuz he doesn't know the situation

813
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Of course not

814
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,848
He only knows if he's reading Awesome piece for wet meanwhile yells bodies teleprompter free

815
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
He only knows

816
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
If his staff

817
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Is feeding him information

818
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,736
Let's recap what happened

819
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
Key Alex

820
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
I had published

821
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,880
List of people's phone numbers and addresses

822
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Just leave from

823
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,000
This Montgomery does Dennis Montgomery

824
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
I just did

825
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
Willits recap what happened yes

826
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
And Trump

827
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
Play with invisible

828
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Of documents

829
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
That Dennis Montgomery has revealed

830
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
But he hasn't

831
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:28,160
All that proves the James

832
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
This is going on and Trump is being f****** Railroad

833
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
It's good

834
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
This

835
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,376
I wish you was on a railroad

836
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
Pencil Thin Mustache

837
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,008
What

838
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Once again I want to use this

839
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Just established

840
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
That Alex

841
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Is specifically

842
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Talkin about

843
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,296
And Arpaio stuff

844
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
As being the exact same thing

845
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
What about butt

846
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,720
In the mix

847
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:10,656
Papa's infowars.com

848
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
Bombshell discovery shows targets

849
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
Project

850
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
Here's a Larry klayman article

851
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,992
House intelligence committee

852
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
Mass surveillance

853
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,792
Where the 47 hard drives over 60 million

854
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Talking about Snowden

855
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
Necessary

856
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,848
Also known as hard drives

857
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,455
3 by 5 floppy

858
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,527
They claim it's actually 600 million.

859
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
Walgreens

860
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,487
The issue is that no one really knows what's on them or if they're even real

861
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
This point

862
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,679
Lead time you couldn't process 600 million documents

863
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
No

864
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
McDonald's

865
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
Cell 99 billion

866
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
10 years

867
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
Alex is proof

868
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,343
But all this is real his phone number and his old phone number is

869
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Along with

870
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
Donald Trump

871
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
Phone numbers

872
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Which again we have

873
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
Suspicions whether he actually knows or not

874
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,839
The only evidence

875
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
He gives at any point

876
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
This stuff is true

877
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
Super stoked bleached show

878
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Obama

879
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Right on truck

880
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Alex Jones

881
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,967
Sheriff Arpaio

882
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,599
.

883
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
Showtime

884
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,839
Nothing on this

885
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
These phone numbers

886
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
By the phone number

887
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Private

888
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Apartment

889
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
These are the numbers

890
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
Miles cell phone number

891
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Mi private office

892
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
Numbers

893
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Real

894
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,743
They're running around saying

895
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,815
World Trump

896
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,143
Defective

897
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Phone numbers

898
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
That nobody could know

899
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Chew it like

900
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,311
It's dumb why would you even have an office phone

901
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
You know your office phone number

902
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,711
Hit the nail right on the head a lot of the stuff is

903
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
Conceivably public information

904
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
But even Alex Jones cell phone number I guarantee I could find it

905
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:19,071
Tiny bit of hacking ability I could find his phone number

906
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Really easily

907
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,751
Based on all of the places that you would have dropped it if you ever went to college all that information

908
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,799
And is really easily accessible like

909
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,871
A bunch of your ear a dresser

910
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
The community

911
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
Wichita

912
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Two cell phones

913
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,039
A lot of the

914
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
I don't think real

915
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
Be that as it may have these things you end up

916
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Filing information places

917
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,887
A lot of your private information is much more accessible than people think

918
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Tons of news reports about this

919
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Work just

920
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
Mid-level basic hacking

921
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
Individual

922
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
Let's not even the most evolved hackers

923
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Are able to find

924
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Tons and tons

925
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
Private information about people

926
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:13,343
You can get f******

927
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
Courtesy calls on your cell phone

928
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
Yeah they're just telling your number

929
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,071
Like if you ever gotten a call on your cell phone polling you that's because somebody told your f****** number

930
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
You can easily

931
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
All that information

932
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:30,751
It's super easy to find proof of an essay CIA database

933
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
Is is cockamamie

934
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
It's ludicrous

935
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
It could have just been

936
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
AT&T

937
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
Yeah absolutely and I mean if you really want to go

938
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Get down to the wood like the bottom of it

939
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
Is that people are selling information

940
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
But that's

941
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,439
Anyway

942
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,255
It's not illegal to sell out

943
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,351
So here we go here we go Alex is

944
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Again reinforcing his own

945
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,191
Sort of narrative

946
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
But doing it in

947
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
Incredibly

948
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
I've got to get this is

949
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
He says

950
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
In terms of

951
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
We have the proof

952
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:14,271
Headlines headlines

953
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,599
Is all day long with Ant-Man edited until right before

954
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,463
He says that you say these that don't say we have all the proof and then he says we have all the headlines

955
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
To say we have all the headlines

956
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
Perfect you look like a

957
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,191
To the actual zullo interview

958
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,103
That unfortunately as tells the story

959
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,199
You start to get the pictures that he actually doesn't

960
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Lititz

961
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
It's really unfortunate

962
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
The title that I gave this

963
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
They don't know what to do with the information

964
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
We really don't know what is going on

965
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,351
We know that we made

966
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
Every endeavor

967
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
To bring

968
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
Mister Montgomery

969
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Disinformation

970
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Federal authorities

971
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
Like I said earlier

972
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
We contacted Larry klayman for his assistance

973
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,943
And under the direction of Sheriff Arpaio we brought

974
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Mister Montgomery 2

975
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:22,879
Judge Royce Lamberth we used to be the head of the fisa Courts

976
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,511
And when we got in there

977
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
The Dilemma

978
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
Involved

979
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
Mister

980
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
During his tenure as a contractor

981
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
Where do I live

982
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
In Michigan

983
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
Illegally

984
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Executed a search warrant on his phone

985
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
And I was all there. In the trial I can find no evidence.

986
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
FBI

987
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
That poster problem for us

988
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:05,119
Because the only other place we could have gone to at that time would have been the Department of Justice and I believe at that time it was still at work

989
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
That was a problem

990
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,959
So here's why it's a problem for them

991
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Because

992
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Not

993
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
No

994
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,103
All of this 600000000 document

995
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
Is confidential information

996
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
So they can just go to a lawyer

997
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
He stole all this allegedly

998
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,879
From the NFL

999
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,183
It is it is a problem

1000
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,999
To take it to the Department of Justice wood holder is

1001
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Willing to process

1002
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
But also

1003
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
This guy

1004
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
Mike zullo

1005
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
This guy who keeps coming up Larry klayman

1006
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
The two of them

1007
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,311
Can't know anything about what's on those

1008
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,871
And if they do they've committed a crime

1009
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,455
Admit that they know anything on it

1010
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Their Evonne are

1011
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
Committed

1012
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Is a pickle

1013
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,439
That's really tough

1014
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,583
Have to believe that they're lying

1015
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
They haven't looked at any

1016
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
All know

1017
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
I think all they're going on

1018
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
Is what

1019
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,615
Acumen

1020
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
They are telling Alex

1021
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,479
What Dennis Montgomery has told them they say

1022
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,111
Sarah playing a big game a telephone here

1023
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,951
That's the Alex had on the other day

1024
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
Like third hand knowledge

1025
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
That where Michelle Obama says the word honky

1026
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,287
Really wish that were true

1027
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Sirhan

1028
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Hoverboard

1029
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Third hand

1030
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
And arrow

1031
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,807
That's

1032
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
Problems

1033
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,671
Cuz they can't make an

1034
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,023
All they can do is speculate about what possibly is in this

1035
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Nation based on what

1036
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Dennis Montgomery is told

1037
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
Everything Alex Jones

1038
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Loves to do

1039
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:20,031
We've already established his investigation to try and help

1040
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,591
Joe Arpaio I was called

1041
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
Joke by Joe Arpaio

1042
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
So

1043
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
That's one p

1044
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Can't wait to

1045
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Let's go

1046
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
I tried doing it now we need we need to let it bills

1047
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
So at this point

1048
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Zullo is going to

1049
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Explain what happened

1050
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
They took the

1051
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,143
Information to the FBI I'll let him spell it out

1052
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
Larry klayman was successful

1053
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
To talk to the FBI

1054
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
Which he did

1055
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,871
To clarify

1056
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
With Larry

1057
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Is

1058
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
Mister Montgomery Broughton

1059
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,783
A sampling of some documentation

1060
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
Gave him what is known as production immunity

1061
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
Again

1062
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,351
This is based on Montgomery

1063
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,911
They wouldn't have done that though if he is

1064
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
Sonos document 600 million documents

1065
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,127
Be in the country

1066
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Like

1067
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:35,295
Goodbye

1068
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,367
These documents

1069
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:44,767
They let him leave and then he just has been living his life

1070
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,095
There's Montgomery at this point in 2017

1071
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Is like 65 years old

1072
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
He's not some sprightly

1073
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
Edward Snowden

1074
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
DC Young and like

1075
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,127
It's a fun whistleblower image

1076
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Citizen 64

1077
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,807
No not at all

1078
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:11,647
You get in your head this idea cuz Snowden keeps coming up that he's like some

1079
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,463
Able Body

1080
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Yeah

1081
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
YouTube

1082
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:22,399
Usually art of seven-year-old dude that he actually

1083
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Steve

1084
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,519
I mean we can talk all the s*** we want but I do believe this guy actually does have some hash

1085
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Capability

1086
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,847
But that's only because

1087
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,383
Occam's razor tells me he

1088
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
In order to fraud

1089
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
We create the document

1090
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
That have been sent to

1091
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Infowars

1092
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,599
Alright I'll stall that out a little bit later as we go along

1093
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
He's knows enough to forge

1094
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Bulshit

1095
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
Gotcha

1096
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,255
Let's talk a little bit more about the FBI

1097
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,863
And he brought in I believe it was like 600 million Wrecker

1098
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
What

1099
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
He provided them that information some time goes by

1100
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
And they called him back and they get alligator in testimonial immunity

1101
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
Information

1102
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Not necessarily

1103
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,047
Again it comes back to you like a lot of that stuff is

1104
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Fairly easy

1105
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Need to find

1106
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Google

1107
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
Some of it could be Google.

1108
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,727
Freaking Google

1109
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
65

1110
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
No not bad at all

1111
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,663
I know a lot of people who are in there

1112
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
No you can't bring

1113
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
You can't be

1114
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,831
Classified documents only Google

1115
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
At this point to another

1116
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
Fart sounds

1117
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Like it might have some Blake

1118
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,351
The most boring person to listen

1119
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,935
Jerome corsi still around

1120
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Good point

1121
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
So he's going to get into this and it sounds scary but don't worry about it

1122
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
I'll be right back on the other side of a 620

1123
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:21,439
Personal information on 151

1124
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,511
Identify

1125
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
That were alleged to be theirs

1126
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,191
Because those bank accounts it is suspected

1127
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,007
That they are actually fraudulent transactions

1128
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Had

1129
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Accounts

1130
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,663
Speculative real estate gas and oil

1131
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,527
Stock plays

1132
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,343
Coronavirus doesn't

1133
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
And

1134
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Derivative

1135
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Things

1136
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
What is he

1137
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Those are

1138
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
Sugar

1139
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Futures

1140
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,679
I don't know

1141
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,751
Actually really unfortunate

1142
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
Specifics because I can trace back exactly what they're talkin

1143
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
Fabulous

1144
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:20,575
Find a little bit of an article from the news of Association in Phoenix that was covering the tree

1145
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,279
Montgomery was investigating snow

1146
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,559
Who was the lawyer

1147
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
Who is

1148
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
The judge

1149
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,703
Joe Arpaio racial discrimination

1150
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,775
Okay

1151
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,079
That Montgomery

1152
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Was being a

1153
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
To investigate

1154
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
The judge

1155
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
Which would be very illegal

1156
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
Really illegal

1157
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
That

1158
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,207
Who is actively opponent

1159
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,047
People who speak out against billions of dollars of lawsuits

1160
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
To be filed

1161
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,911
Because of his dictator is behaviors

1162
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
Any movie from the south

1163
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,615
Northern California are 80 movies

1164
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
Arpaio insisted

1165
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,223
Encourage Montgomery to investigate the judge

1166
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
Instead

1167
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,111
Arpaio insisted the informant was investigating bank fraud

1168
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:30,719
And the judge was one of 150,000 alleged Maricopa

1169
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
What county

1170
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Now that 150 is important

1171
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
Because that's

1172
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,607
From the number

1173
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
That this guy just reference

1174
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,959
As the nsac I-80

1175
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,031
Allegedly included Donald Trump

1176
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
And Alex Jones

1177
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
Do they live in Maricopa County

1178
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
Possibility

1179
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
That that

1180
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,623
They're Reapers the repurposing bulshit information

1181
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
Bulshit inform

1182
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
Right

1183
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,439
Wow that's

1184
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
Well

1185
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
We should recite

1186
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
I think that's a

1187
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Very important

1188
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Climate change

1189
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,959
Exactly

1190
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
So Arpaio

1191
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
Hattiesburg

1192
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,615
Arpaio in Montgomery had this bank fraud thing

1193
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
That was cover

1194
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
For him investigator

1195
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
This judge

1196
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
There was trying to

1197
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
Racial profiling

1198
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,391
What is not actually invested in

1199
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
Striking him down

1200
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
You scaring the

1201
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,255
The prosecutors are more the issue

1202
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
But he's

1203
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
What have you

1204
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:45,727
Kids with that that fits with the kind of paranoid personality that we're dealing with

1205
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,775
Because he doesn't believe that

1206
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
It is never

1207
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,359
He always believed this one guy

1208
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,919
All of the Power

1209
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,967
Cuz he's a guy with all of this.

1210
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Lutera

1211
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,439
Dictator who can't understand that

1212
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
He can understand that laws are real

1213
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,167
Order that the Sheriff's Office

1214
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,263
Turn over documents relating to Montgomery Montgomery's investigation

1215
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:24,383
These documents include timelines and flowcharts to allege conversations inclusion

1216
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,431
Between judge snow the doj

1217
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
Burlington

1218
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Which represents the plane

1219
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
MK

1220
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:41,535
Christmas on Friday plaintiff's lawyer question about Montgomery

1221
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:48,447
Montgomery was looking into judge snow and would personally interested in that Pro

1222
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,287
Both

1223
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
Earrings

1224
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,871
They didn't ask Montgomery to make those.

1225
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
Sheridan testified earlier in the hearing

1226
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,783
Then he told the detective and Sergeant working with Montgomery not to pursue the investigation

1227
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
The judge

1228
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
Article goes on to explain

1229
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,719
That I want to find

1230
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
It's f****** hilarious

1231
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:21,215
Young who was employed by Covington in Burlington

1232
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,663
This lawyer young who's employed by Covington Burlington showed Arpaio

1233
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
I had received a fax

1234
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
Text from Montgomery

1235
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
In November 2013

1236
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,575
With an early version of a timeline showing event

1237
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
In the Department of Justice

1238
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
This is racial profiling case

1239
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,951
And the racial profiling case and judge Snow's Court

1240
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
As well as information about alleged wiretap

1241
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
On the back of the facts

1242
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
Arpaio use the typewriter to make some

1243
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,407
Traveling through time right now

1244
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:08,575
Handwritten notes about possible connections and hand wrote on the same f***

1245
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,415
Do you have wrote about

1246

About possible connections between George snow in the law firm Covington & Burling

1247
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,303
Piazza Berlin

1248
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,167
If you drew his hand at church

1249
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,239
These notes mentioned that former Arizona Senator John

1250
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,799
Worked with the law firm Covington & Burling

1251
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,127
There's no mention there's also mention

1252
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,711
Judge Snow's wife works there as well which is not

1253
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
True the notes read

1254
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,575
Snow's snow confirmed by US Senate

1255
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,159
Keilon Judiciary Committee on June 26th 2008

1256
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,719
Obama takes office January 2009

1257
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
Judge born 1959

1258
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,815
It's all crazy nonsense

1259
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
Handwritten

1260
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,655

Together

1264
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,895
All of it is

1265
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:10,015
Desperately grasping at straws and clearly Montgomery was not working on a bank fraud case

1266
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
He was cover

1267
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
That he used

1268
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
Note also noted quotes

1269
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
Wilcox's husband

1270
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,743
Envy 150000

1271
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,071
That's the people that were allegedly being bit

1272
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,887
Being targeted as well as the number of Jehovah's

1273
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Make it into heaven

1274
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,775
Wilcox refer to for Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose

1275
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
Text husband Earl

1276
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,103
Arpaio said it was a reference to him

1277
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,431
Can we just talk about how the whitest names in a row you just

1278
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,223
Earl and Mary Rose Wilcox

1279
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:46,111
Arpaio said it was a reference to him being among the 150,000 victims of bank fraud

1280
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
That note quote

1281
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
Totally floored Earl Wilcox

1282
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,255
Who is in the courtroom in his own name in the documents

1283
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,303
Automata in the gallery

1284
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,607
The wilcox's are vocal opponent

1285
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,215
The Sheriff's Office had to Rose Wilcox

1286
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,519
If you want a civil suit against the county

1287
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
For the baseless charge

1288
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,615
So you get a sense of what's going on here

1289
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
Arpeggio is

1290
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,967
Acting illegally all the time

1291
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,783
Super all the time all the time

1292
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
And

1293
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
Montgomery

1294
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
Was

1295
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,159
Confidential informant

1296
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
In quotes

1297
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,719
Who is actually doing

1298
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,791
Pretty illegal investigations on his back

1299
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
That's the flavor we've got right now

1300
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Promise you

1301
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,471
This is going to develop

1302
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
It's going to be a rose pet

1303
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Blossom

1304
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,615
I would prefer

1305
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,639
A Bloomin Onion

1306
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
From TGI

1307
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:47,295
If you want to do a roast battle that's fine

1308
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,087
Okay at this point the alleged

1309
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
151,000 people

1310
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,183
Include Donald Trump Alex Jones

1311
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,975
Alex Jones is old office

1312
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
And what have you

1313
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
His private office

1314
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,815
This number is old cell phone number

1315
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,607
His mom's birthday

1316
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,655
His sons

1317
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Mitzvah

1318
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
His great-grandmother's

1319
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
She's a slave I don't know

1320
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
What's being alleged now

1321
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Was used

1322
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,407
Years ago in this court case

1323
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
As

1324
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
Information

1325
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,271
Of all people live in Maricopa County

1326
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
Zorbing

1327
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
Victims of bank fraud in order to cover for an investigation

1328
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Intuit federal judge

1329
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,439
So that's what's going on

1330
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
Alex

1331
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,815
It's possible he doesn't know that

1332
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,935
All of those words you just said are more words than Alex Jones can understand

1333
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,055
Right but you should have boiled baby Alex Jones

1334
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:47,455
Understand headline

1335
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:49,759
Alrighty

You built

1337
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,599
Gathered evidence

1338
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
It's for that research pretty ugly

1339
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,695
You put a lot of work

1340
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,719
Bedtime

1341
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
An effort into

1342
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,583
All of that points to only one possible conclusion

1343
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
That you can then if tablets

1344
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,703
Is reality even further

1345
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Where do you think

1346
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
And that why

1347
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,823
Alex Jones Woodstock

1348
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,663
He wouldn't eat just part where you said

1349
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,199
Sears

1350
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,247
You know where he would stop

1351
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:27,647
As soon as any like indication that he's not totally right

1352
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:34,815
So here's the next it's Mike zullo a game getting into how they don't actually know

1353
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
Right now on the

1354
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,679
Inside of Alex Bean

1355
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Because he's in it

1356
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
I think

1357
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
That it's possible

1358
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,055
I think that is pretty strong and

1359
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Here's the problem

1360
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,871
Later,

1361
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,223
He's going to do is

1362
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,759
He talks to him and stuff like that

1363
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:58,879
I believe that there is a vested interest in Alex

1364
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,927
I don't know if you

1365
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
If you

1366
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
He's super willing to be

1367
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
Alex Jones is always super willing to be

1368
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
That's true

1369
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
Truly horrific

1370
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
Nightmarish

1371
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
Pile of garbage human being

1372
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
In the same way that he want

1373
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
How to suck up to the f******

1374
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,183
Alleged

1375
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
See Jesse James

1376
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,447
We got a lot of ground to cover so I'm going to skip the

1377
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,263
This next clip because it's about it earlier

1378
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
It's basically just

1379
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
Azula repeating

1380
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
In different languages

1381
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,895
Don't really actually know what's going on

1382
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,199
They don't know what the documents say

1383
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,015
80-in

1384
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,879
Next clip explaining

1385
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:07,231
Some of Dennis Montgomery's pedigree and where you come from

1386
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,791
Evidence of by argument

1387
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,583
That he is able to

1388
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
Discover

1389
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
People private information

1390
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Through Tech

1391
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Employee on his own

1392
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
As opposed to Batman who just

1393
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
Hangs out in the butt

1394
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,943
Well I I don't want to go into too much of what he said

1395
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,831
Actually mr. Montgomery in this is public

1396
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:36,927
Pfister Montgomery was a contractor who developed the

1397
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
Hacking software

1398
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
That could penetrate

1399
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
Firewalls

1400
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
A computer's breach them

1401
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:47,167
Take over as the administrator and remain undetected for about an hour and a half

1402
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,543
And download whatever they are

1403
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,895
What's the time frame

1404
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:03,295
Play movie exact location

1405
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:08,159
We can mask up for an hour and a half build something that only lasts for an hour and a half

1406
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
At 4 because it's a lie

1407
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,767
I think it might be alive

1408
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
But I do believe that he has some hacker

1409
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,375
Done some research

1410
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
And figured out exactly

1411
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
What

1412
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,519
Dennis Montgomery was doing when he died

1413
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,591
The subtitle of this episode is

1414
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,407
So I told you about Dennis Montgomery

1415
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:36,575
1998 founded a company called etrepid technology

1416
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,391
Thank you we're going to burn him

1417
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:44,767
Like I said it started out as a casino tool

1418
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:53,471
Eventually I started targeting Sino industry they started branch

1419
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
The government

1420
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,567
That's right around then

1421
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,711
Dennis claimed develops software that would analyze barcodes that appeared on Al Jazeera

1422
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Any used these Dakota

1423
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,319
Information

1424
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
To predict impending terrorist

1425
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,927
This is what he developed

1426
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
He's a

1427
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
Student

1428
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:21,887
The Kabbalah is that what you're saying

1429
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
He's just

1430
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
So he's out there

1431
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,495
Planning

1432
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,359
The terrorist attacks through the barcodes

1433
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
To predict

1434
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
A terrorist

1435
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,855
I kind of make sense

1436
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
On a horse

1437
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
At that point

1438
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,951
The gentleman named Tom Ridge

1439
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Was Homeland

1440
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Security direct

1441
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
And that it was legit

1442
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:59,007
The information gleaned from the software to raise the terror alert multiple times

1443
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,591
He went so far as to evacuate public buildings

1444
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
A call for flights to be grounded

1445
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,431
Based on interpretation

1446
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:10,527
Of barcodes on Al Jazeera through Dennis Montgomery soft

1447
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
It is

1448
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,927
Very real living

1449
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
It's so real

1450
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
Like you know

1451
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:25,631
Is it in the Kabbalah where it's like they put certain letters of each

1452
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:31,263
Weird stuff

1453
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
The end of the world

1454
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:37,151
It's exactly the same sort of logic

1455
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:42,783
Because I don't want to ruin where this going to go

1456
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
I don't want to ruin

1457
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,599
The entire end of the story yet

1458
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,159
But a CIA agent who was involved

1459
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:54,559
I'm like the implementation of the technology and it being brought in

1460
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Quoted later

1461
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
The meeting where they burned

1462
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,447
Information is being this is so embarrassing

1463
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,007
Kia

1464
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Hold on

1465
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
I'll just spell out the rest

1466
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,295
Activist story now because why not

1467
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,391
There's no way they could have killed JF

1468
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
People bite

1469
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Stupid

1470
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:26,047
Such incompetence considered

1471
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,375
Immoral

1472
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:36,287
You want to arrive at in someone gives you like

1473
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,895
Confirmation possible version of of your conclusion

1474
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,199
911

1475
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
So

1476
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
This guy

1477
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:49,855
His software used

1478
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
To make Terror predict

1479
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Is it

1480
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
What is it what is it even look like

1481
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,535
This is 2003 levels

1482
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,119
Alright don't put them in and this is back when you had to use

1483
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
No

1484
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,479
Rudimentary flash drive

1485
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,343
We're using or you let's call it Windows 2000

1486
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
You've noticed

1487
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
Windows

1488
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Well whatever

1489
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,815
It's Montgomery let's call it Windows 95

1490
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,863
I don't know if it's like

1491
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:39,263
MLB The Show

1492
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
So are using

1493
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
Base window

1494
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,407
Our first GUI

1495
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
And

1496
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
This guy

1497
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Put in a CD

1498
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,319
That analyzes barcodes on Al Jazeera

1499
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,623
Rightfully so that means he's

1500
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,927
What

1501
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,743
You got screenshots

1502
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
Takes in 5 minutes

1503
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,815
To download each picture of Al Jazeera

1504
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,887
Can you pull up a command prompt and it looks at it like

1505
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
Does one of those like

1506
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
Best software had to bend

1507
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
Same level of Technology

1508
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
Where in the World is Carmen

1509
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
Without rockapella

1510
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,967
That is there's no possible way that was even

1511
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
Real software random number generator

1512
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Here's what happened

1513
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Alright a little bit

1514
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,351
And they realized I was just making

1515
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
King s*** up

1516
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
Yep and I know that

1517
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,215
Not only

1518
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:45,823
These barcodes on Al Jazeera

1519
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,871
He just made even that part off about it

1520
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:52,479
So the FBI didn't is a conman of ridiculous

1521
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
Csbi did a counter invest

1522
01:12:54,527 --> 01:13:00,671
Navigation to Dennis Montgomery history of fraud

1523
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
He had

1524
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,559
Gambling problem with VTEC

1525
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,679
I CIA agent like I said was quoted as saying that the whole thing was quote

1526
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,471
His former lawyer

1527
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,519
Representative

1528
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,591
Actually his name is Michael Jace

1529
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,407
Which is weird cuz that's my son's name

1530
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
It's not the same guy as far as I can tell

1531
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
That's also Michael j.fox

1532
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,415
What's up I think we can rule out Michael j.fox was basically the

1533
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
The character in The Secret of My Success

1534
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,815
A lawyer described as Montgomery is a con artist

1535
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,887
And quote a habitual liar engaged in fraud

1536
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
Defended

1537
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,007
So that's the guy

1538
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,823
That's the guy about it somehow

1539
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Like

1540
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,503
Can I just get like catch me if you can

1541
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
Memories in my head

1542
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,463
What is there a movie

1543
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,327
There are too many movies where our secret service in our CIA is in our intelligence

1544
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Community it comp

1545
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,167
When there are so many more stories were there

1546
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,727
Right right

1547
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,751
CIA

1548
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,823
Stupid that deserves our public interest

1549
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,919
We like to create

1550
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,759
Feeling safe feeling a lot better

1551
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,575
Jordan

1552
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,927
51 really great

1553
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,743
Yes you do

1554
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,559
Sew-in 2006's governor

1555
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,031
I accused

1556
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
He claimed his own business

1557
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,895
Casino chips

1558
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,967
And $100,000 in cash in exchange for favors

1559
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
Said that

1560
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,807
Committed

1561
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,831
Valentines

1562
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
That was his like

1563
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:10,719
I committed a crime

1564
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,303
You're corrupted

1565
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:20,959
It's not great for immunity beforehand or did you clear

1566
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:26,335
So he claimed he claimed they gave him all of this money in exchange for favors

1567
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,175
Rite Aid Montgomery claimed that he had emails from Gibbons

1568
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:33,759
Private email

1569
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
That he was he was not lying

1570
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,671
Gibbons said that the emails were fake

1571
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
In court

1572
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
Computer expert testified

1573
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,607
That he must challenge the authenticity of the emails

1574
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
The court case was thrown out

1575
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:56,031
An 18-month FBI investigation concluded

1576
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
They cleared him of all charges

1577
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
18 months

1578
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:06,271
A US

1579
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,063
Ethics Committee investigate

1580
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
The charges as well

1581
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
And found no wrongdoing

1582
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,439
Now why is this case super important

1583
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,791
It shows has a liar an idiot

1584
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,583
And willing to

1585
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Falsify documents

1586
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
Super well there is an indication

1587
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
That was

1588
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,959
Borne out in court

1589
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
He has

1590
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
Fraudulently created

1591
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,615
And so now we're citing his documents

1592
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Who's going to be a hoax

1593
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,111
Give history

1594
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Has been shown

1595
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,047
Create.

1596
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:55,423
You know you committed crimes you if you accuse that dude

1597
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
Committing a crime

1598
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
Also

1599
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
Oh yeah

1600
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Happens

1601
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
Montgomery's off the hook for bribery

1602
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
Cuz he didn't do it

1603
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:17,183
Or making false statements

1604
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Actually a trial he would have had to

1605
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
To testify that

1606
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,631
And testified that then that would be

1607
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,423
He would have perjured himself under oath

1608
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,519
Maybe he trial

1609
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,103
These claims

1610
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,967
Initiated and that he never said anything on turo

1611
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,879
If you have committed a crime

1612
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,463
Yeah so this is the guy who's the root of these

1613
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Fake

1614
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,607
Database that I was Jones exciting as evidence

1615
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
Himself

1616
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Entropic being

1617
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
Spider-Man

1618
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
Clear at this point

1619
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,263
But that is not

1620
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
True

1621
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,823
Absolutely not

1622
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
Have Kik

1623
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,151
Morass

1624
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,479
On that story than anyone has ever kick

1625
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,039
I promise you it's not.

1626
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:21,439
That's nothing expose that you just did no one will really ever hit the news

1627
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:28,351
Do you know what the reason they're complaining about how the FBI is making no moves on this stuff

1628
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
And there's a media blackout

1629
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:36,031
But that is why the media blackout

1630
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,567
Look at what was the

1631
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
Yeah YouTube

1632
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
You just kicked it

1633
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,431
You just kicked your ass you kept all the answer the story

1634
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Again it's not done

1635
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
We still have to get to Larry klayman

1636
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,295
Seriously

1637
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
This is amazing this next

1638
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,695
So we're still in Missoula interview

1639
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,791
And Jerome corsi who is been silently apart of this the whole time

1640
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
But then

1641
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,095
To try and vouch

1642
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,911
For the situation that's going on

1643
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,727
And I want to play this clip just

1644
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,799
Little another side argument I want to make right after

1645
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
Bikes

1646
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,719
We would work on this for days

1647
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,255
Couple of weeks

1648
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
Is used car dealer

1649
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,223
Speaks the truth it's carefully

1650
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,063
Put together

1651
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,855
Here's why play that clip

1652
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:58,975
He's desperately trying to provide credibility for Mike zullo

1653
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
REI

1654
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
But

1655
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:04,095
He doesn't realize that if you look at the history of Jerome corsi

1656
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
That's a liar vouching

1657
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Sing for your credibility

1658
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Would you actually

1659
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,239
Jerome corsi

1660
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,567
Laid out a book

1661
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,872
About Obama's birth certificate

1662
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,920
He was also a member of the Swift

1663
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,712
Swift boat lettering

1664
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
Boating

1665
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
Yeah

1666
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
He is that so when he comes in and

1667
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,112
This guy is honest as the day is long

1668
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,648
To me that means

1669
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,208
Oh we just both have the same propaganda goal

1670
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
That's all he's saying

1671
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:36,352
Anyway I'm looking and being like dude I love this guy's lies

1672
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:41,216
We have one more again

1673
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
Spelling out

1674
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,520
Very clearly

1675
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,312
And very overtly

1676
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,104
But he doesn't know anything

1677
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,664
There's no information that he has

1678
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,296
He even let slip that he can't even confirm that anybody was ever wiretap

1679
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,392
Which is kind of unfortunate for the outrageous claims

1680
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,952
Plus I'm Sheriff Arpaio

1681
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
Account is

1682
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:06,304
The timeline and I'm going by memory

1683
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,608
Understanding is

1684
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,728
This alleged wiretap

1685
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,552
Orange seeds

1686
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:33,952
Tell us more about what occurred under 8

1687
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,560
Withdraw

1688
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,120
And at the same time

1689
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,168
Individuals that were

1690
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,848
The Clearblue a civil proceeding ensued

1691
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,408
Hey this is talking about Covington & Burling

1692
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,688
Again this is

1693
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Earlier

1694
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
But

1695
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
Let's be clear

1696
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,648
Alex is trying to say that like you don't have DNA testing can't prove it

1697
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,464
The duck the expression is if it walks like a duck

1698
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,488
And talks like a duck

1699
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,888
Going the other direction with a duck metaphor

1700
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,312
Starting in the middle of forest family

1701
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,408
Hold on one second we're going to need a blood

1702
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Hey son f******

1703
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Improve it

1704
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,784
Prove that's a duck you son-of-a-b****

1705
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
F***

1706
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:36,672
You and also it shows that Alex Jones has a higher standard of proof about like what is a duck

1707
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:41,280
Anything else we talked about on his show of evidence

1708
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
Is is is glaring

1709
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,376
So we're going to leave Mike zullo now that is been

1710
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
His timing

1711
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
As it works

1712
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,056
I don't necessarily have a ton against Mike zullo except I found

1713
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
Evidence

1714
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
In an article

1715
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,688
He's part of the

1716
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:04,832
That's enough from the Phoenix New Times I did find an article about the case

1717
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,112
Against Arpaio

1718
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,416
And it's interesting that Mike Zoo

1719
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,464
I was called to testify

1720
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Invoked

1721
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
The Fifth Amendment

1722
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
What a shocker

1723
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,096
He pleaded self-incrimination in court

1724
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Which means

1725
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,704
I mean you're not always guilty when you plead the Fifth

1726
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,752
But in this case it does seem to imply

1727
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:27,360
If he wants to go out there publicly and talk about how there's a railroad in case being done

1728
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:32,992
It seems if you're in if you're in court you'd want to provide the evidence than Ingo

1729
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,296
The kind of means that you're

1730
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,112
Afraid of what might come out

1731
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:43,744
Anyone who is under any kind of Trials do not say a goddamn word

1732
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
I agree with that

1733
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Whether or not

1734
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,424
Whether or not

1735
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
Do not say a goddamn thing

1736
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Let It Go

1737
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,664
Until you

1738
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Sodus Point

1739
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
We transition

1740
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,624
Stationary go to how Alex end

1741
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
This gentleman who's come up a couple times

1742
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,256
Larry klayman on the Friday

1743
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Episode of the shop

1744
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,608
Meanwhile throughout the week he was yelling about this evidence

1745
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,400
Everything

1746
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
I'm saying is correct

1747
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
This whole time

1748
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:28,288
Hazme bababababababa

1749
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:32,128
So that is why reclaiming his guests here is the introduction of how he brings him

1750
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
Into the

1751
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Show

1752
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
Larry

1753
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,624
The clay man

1754
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:47,744
Exposing 4 is fine going on against the president against Congress has been in the news for years

1755
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,816
The CIA

1756
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,848
Here in just a moment Larry klayman legendary Larry klayman

1757
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,896
He never was the verdict

1758
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:10,016
We can't prove without a little bird

1759
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,064
This is extra Market

1760
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
When were

1761
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
Devin Nunes

1762
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
No he didn't

1763
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
He got it for Larry klayman

1764
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,560
Larry klayman

1765
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
That's what Alex just said

1766
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,632
And in this interview

1767
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
Larry klayman

1768
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Cypress mulch

1769
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,752
Larry klayman would have talked to him

1770
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
At all

1771
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,824
The only word

1772
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Speculation

1773
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,128
Episode

1774
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,480
Because the history does bear out there is

1775
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,016
Look I can't

1776
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
I can't prove it

1777
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:46,368
These Liars are always lying but

1778
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,352
Larry klayman telling of it he had been trying to get this information

1779
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,144
The devyn Nunez for quite a while

1780
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,168
And succeeded

1781
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
So

1782
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,312
All feels like anime

1783
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:08,384
I wrote it on the back of that

1784
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,504
Paper airplane the directions

1785
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,576
I have been doing everything I can to get this

1786
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,600
Information to Nunez

1787
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,392
Again that's Montgomery not

1788
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,672
Clayman

1789
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,208
But

1790
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,744
Establish those are the only Farms

1791
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
The communication that Alex Jones

1792
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Is okra

1793
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,376
One thing that's important to lay out here is that Larry klayman

1794
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,936
Montgomery's lawyer now

1795
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,240
The former lawyer called him

1796
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,056
Habitually engaged in fraud

1797
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
Yes now

1798
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
Larry klayman is his lawyer

1799
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,152
The two of them met

1800
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,944
Through Joe Arpaio

1801
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,040
When Joe Arpaio was being represented by Larry klayman

1802
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,880
Dennis Montgomery was the confidential informant

1803
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:54,208
We're having a wonderful romantic comedy

1804
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:08,288
We take a break from all of this information

1805
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,896
Reduction

1806
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,456
Alex Jones realizes that you got to pay the bill

1807
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,696
The only victory

1808
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:31,328
First off where was first reported by the products

1809
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,120
First off you're crazy we have the best

1810
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:39,008
Organic fluoride free with soil silver and

1811
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,152
Surgeon

1812
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:51,296
Matt manufacturer the biggest manufacturer in the country

1813
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,112
Tell you who's our private labeling but this is iodine

1814
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,648
False or attitude

1815
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,720
I think you might have just breached his contract

1816
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,536
That's not that's not fair

1817
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:07,680
To Tom's of Maine the contract says you can't say who made it

1818
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:14,080
Whoops whoops

1819
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,944
I've not review their contracts

1820
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,736
Certainly don't know why

1821
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
Alex Jones

1822
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:28,416
The full-on vial of Larry klayman

1823
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
I'll be back

1824
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,816
Bayou

1825
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
It would take too long

1826
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
Everybody knows who Larry klayman is

1827
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,960
No one knows who Larry klayman is

1828
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,496
No one knows who Larry klayman is

1829
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:46,592
And he doesn't go over his bio so I will

1830
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
Would you like to know

1831
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,944
Would you like to know some fun facts about Larry klayman

1832
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:56,576
Owen Clements behavior in the 1992 trial in California Federal Court

1833
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,904
William Lehman from his courtroom for life

1834
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:07,072
Hold on hold on

1835
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
Hold up

1836
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,936
Five years later in a separate case in New York

1837
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,216
District

1838
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,848
To issue a lifetime ban on the attorney practicing law before

1839
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,152
Well Danny Chen sounds like

1840
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,088
Have barred him from practicing law in front of them

1841
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,112
4life

1842
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,744
Claimant has written about his dealings with do that

1843
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
If you're a judge

1844
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,328
It's essential

1845
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,400
It's essentially an extreme version of holding someone in contempt

1846
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
Absolutely

1847
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
Do you at least get

1848
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,728
To say he's out of order

1849
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,128
Claiming his feelings of Keller in

1850
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,432
Claiming that color

1851
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,480
And was quote obviously drunk

1852
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,832
I don't believe you

1853
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:05,440
The best way in 2017

1854
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:10,560
Received from a woman facing criminal charges

1855
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
And she accused him of not providing legal services in return

1856
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,192
The Florida Bar Association

1857
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:18,240
The matter

1858
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
Small portion

1859
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,200
He was reprimanded by the Association

1860
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,760
It it was just like hey

1861
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Dude

1862
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,904
He's filed at least you don't have to pay

1863
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:41,024
He has filed at least 18 lawsuits against the accusations of racketeering

1864
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,816
Two bunch of s*** about Benghazi

1865
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:47,680
In the wake of the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officer

1866
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,032
Claimant filed a lawsuit against

1867
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:58,176
Former US Attorney General Eric Holder the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan

1868
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,504
Matter movement

1869
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,320
Alleged

1870
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,344
That led to the shooting

1871
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
Play Man amended the complaint to

1872
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,952
Include Dallas police officer

1873
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:16,864
And Hillary Clinton and George Soros as defense enough I mean this is super weird but I'm reading off

1874
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632
Your screen

1875
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:20,704
Former San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan

1876
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,008
I don't know how he got in there but he is part of the

1877
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,592
Autograph

1878
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
That case

1879
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
It was just

1880
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,712
A poet was

1881
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:37,088
And all of them

1882
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,256
What nobody could stop you a lot to get disbarred

1883
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,584
What even is being a lawyer if you can just

1884
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,448
Is anybody paying a also James Carville Cajun

1885
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,288
Call Tim like a jackass

1886
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
In 1998

1887
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
Swimming suits mother for $50,000

1888
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:06,528
Reimbursement for medical care provided to his maternal grandmother

1889
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:10,112
After claiming brother told Newsweek magazine

1890
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,136
Clayman

1891
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,720
The Clinton White House was responsible for the magazine

1892
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
Nope it was your brother

1893
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,816
That's a stretch

1894
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Got to stretch

1895
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,376
It was on

1896
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,912
So he's just a

1897
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,520
Into October 2014

1898
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:33,920
Claiming it secretly allow the Ebola virus to enter the

1899
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:38,528
American-Asian race and Jewish Christian religion

1900
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,600
Any other possible

1901
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,768
He was involved in that

1902
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
Love those lies

1903
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:56,192
15 claimant filed a defamation suit on behalf of Dennis Montgomery.

1904
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,056
I think he's media hora

1905
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Yeah well yeah

1906
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:09,760
Lawyer I know but like what did he do he's probably a sleazy lawyer I don't know who.

1907
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
Listen

1908
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:25,888
Probably I wouldn't be surprised if he's Better Call Saul type of guy

1909
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,728
DuckTales a little bit with

1910
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,056
Defamation lawsuit

1911
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
The author of the book

1912
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,640
Call pay any price

1913
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
Green power in the endless war

1914
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:42,272
The lawsuit alleged describe Montgomery is quote

1915
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,320
The Maestro behind what

1916
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
Former US officials

1917
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
Believe was the most

1918
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
The Labyrinth

1919
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
Susan American

1920
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,768
This is that software we discussed earlier

1921
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,536
To be able to predict

1922
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,680
Salad bowls

1923
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:04,288
How do you get too good of a con man

1924
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,080
Man that you can just make that s*** up

1925
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,176
It couldn't have even looked like

1926
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:16,832
Like that's the thing about computer I don't think I don't think you would understand.

1927
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,648
Road effect erodic software thing but because

1928
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,232
People don't have that computer savvy they're willing to be

1929
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,280
Like you're just like

1930
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:30,144
This is why we can't have old people in power anymore they don't even like

1931
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:30,912
Can't do it

1932
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,752
They don't even live in the world we live in

1933
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,824
0

1934
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,616
The DNC hacking was not

1935
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,640
Some sort of cop

1936
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
Implicated movie Hack

1937

Quick tan

1938
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,528
Like that's all it was

1939
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,320
Like there's no real hack

1940
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
Can going on like what

1941
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
People think it is

1942
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,976
Sophisticated

1943
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
That's really

1944
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
But again

1945
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,120
All of this stuff

1946
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
We have a

1947
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,216
Power armor

1948
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,544
Let me get through I Larry claimants bio

1949
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,360
There's more

1950
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,920
Well you know what Alex was right in saying

1951
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,200
That he did not have time

1952
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,272
We do

1953
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Clayman

1954
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,416
On behalf of

1955
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,256
In 2016 a federal court

1956
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,536
That lawsuit

1957
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,352
I was appealed as I as I understand

1958
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Appeal

1959
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:41,056
I believe in Marine Le Pen

1960
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,944
Prime ministerial candidate

1961
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
You can

1962
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,296
And we'll call her effects

1963
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:56,160
That's a great lawsuit there's two sides of it is

1964
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,184
She is

1965
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
Legally a fascist

1966
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,768
Yes but then the other side

1967
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,304
Just findings was that

1968
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
You can't

1969
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,144
Considerate definition when you're in

1970
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,168
A political

1971
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,448
Sphere

1972
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,752
Just describing someone

1973
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
Political beliefs

1974
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
Isn't defamation

1975
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,592
If there is

1976
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,688
Credibility

1977
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,528
Larry klayman filed at least three lawsuits

1978
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,368
Claiming that Obama was not eligible to be president cuz his birth certificate was fake

1979
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
Okay

1980
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,672
He tried to defend

1981
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:36,864
As we all know Cliven Bundy is a crazy person as is

1982
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,984
The judge ruled

1983
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Clayman

1984
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:47,360
Headband dishonest history of discipline

1985
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,408
And he had no clearance or standing

1986
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:53,248
Go to assign himself as someone else's lawyer

1987
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,576
The one that mean

1988
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,600
Cliven Bundy

1989
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,904
Did not want his help at all.

1990
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,928
M2

1991
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,000
I would actually go the opposite direction where the judges like

1992
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
Jesus man you said you were

1993
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,376
More than you

1994
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,752
I'm a victim

1995
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:23,456
2013 claim and declared it a conservative rally in Washington DC that quote

1996
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:28,064
This President is not a president of We the People he's a president

1997
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:28,832
Whoops

1998
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,648
That's probably rare lyrics

1999
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
Barry race

2000
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,232
He urged the crowd to begin a quote

2001
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:40,096
American nonviolent Revolution and demanded the President Obama quote

2002
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,632
Put the Quorum down

2003
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,192
And figuratively come out with his hands up

2004
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
Weeks Later

2005
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,848
Put the volume down

2006
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:56,736
Weeks Later claim and sponsored reclaim America rally

2007
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,040
In Lafayette Square across from the White House

2008
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,832
I was calling for the president's removal

2009
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:04,416
Claimant stated that if Obama did the first American

2010
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Nonviolent

2011
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:12,096
I can't think of one of the violent revolution

2012
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:18,240
Obama did not resign conservative

2013
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
Whoops

2014
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,384
Considering that now all they talk about is how there's a shadow government

2015
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,968
Anyway

2016
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:35,648
Millions to occupy Washington DC

2017
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:39,232
Hollywood between 130 and 200

2018
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
Also

2019
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,864
They're going to talk about this

2020
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
Princeton a little bit

2021
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
He won a court case

2022
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
About

2023
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,848
And varied and

2024
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:00,736
Klayman vs. Obama

2025
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Where

2026
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,040
He was trying to

2027
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,576
Contestant

2028
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,344
Collection

2029
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,880
A phone and internet metadata

2030
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Good

2031
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,672
That's a good one

2032
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,720
We can agree

2033
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Like a lot of that stuff is

2034
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Pretty

2035
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
11 delete

2036
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
It's pretty f*****

2037
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,192
A lot of police state

2038
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:23,264
In front of a judge

2039
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,080
Did not laugh

2040
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
Here come the judge

2041
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,384
Did the judge

2042
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,992
If you're a jerk

2043
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,528
And you Google this

2044
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,552
Chicken guy wouldn't

2045
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,832
You just be like no Get It Go

2046
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,368
Go go

2047
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:41,952
The judge would

2048
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
Play Brew

2049
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
I'm out of the courtroom

2050
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,840
The Apollo

2051
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:51,680
2013 and US Federal

2052
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,984
Richard J Leon

2053
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,056
He ruled that book collection of America

2054
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:59,104
Telephone metadata

2055
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,872
Constitution

2056
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,432
He had insanely

2057
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,456
Legitimate

2058
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,480
Concern

2059
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,504
About

2060
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,528
Call

2061
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,600
This program could violate people's Fourth Amendment rights

2062
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,440
Unreasonable search and seizure

2063
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,464
Stop

2064
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,816
And then actually comes

2065
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,584
The ruling

2066
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
Cuz it wasn't

2067
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,656
Before

2068
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
But

2069
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,216
He ruled in favor

2070
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
Of

2071
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,008
Clayman

2072
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,080
Whose last name is strange

2073
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Alright

2074
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
The original trial was held

2075
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,136
And the judge agreed with the argument

2076
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,696
That metadata collection

2077
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
The 4th amendment

2078
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
Was to say Isis

2079
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,584
Spend my judgment

2080
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
For six months

2081
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
To allow

2082
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
The government to appeal

2083
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,800
That you be made

2084
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,336
That any

2085
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,872
Metadata collection

2086
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
Regarding strange or claiming

2087
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,688
I have to stop

2088
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,224
Every

2089
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,528
Bit of information that had been

2090
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,552
Had to be destroyed

2091
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,600
He stayed his ruling for 6 months

2092
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,880
Allowing for appeal

2093
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
During that

2094
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
6 month

2095
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,280
They can still collect their medal

2096
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
No

2097
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,168
Yeah yeah

2098
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,704
Change for the next 6 months

2099
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,520
If the government doesn't respond then the ruling stands

2100
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
Respond

2101
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,872
Basically

2102
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,944
The appeals court found that

2103
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:43,552
Because the program had been ended they didn't have a responsibility to rule on the

2104
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
Legality

2105
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,600
Of the Fourth Amendment claim

2106
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,160
Secondarily they found

2107
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
That

2108
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
There's no

2109
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,000
They could be provided

2110
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,048
They claiming or strain

2111
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
Actually were spied on it

2112
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,144
Or hands or meditate

2113
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,448
And therefore they have no standing in Port

2114
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
To bring the

2115
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,520
Even

2116
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,800
Do the government

2117
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,360
Collect bulk metadata

2118
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,896
Premeditated

2119
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
Was collected

2120
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
They're kicked out

2121
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,480
And they can't represent

2122
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,248
The entirety of

2123
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,832
Part of their argument was the bear Verizon customers

2124
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,648
They collected Verizon

2125
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
Metadata

2126
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,952
The thing is

2127
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,304
I told on the government admitted that they collected

2128
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
Business

2129
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
Through Verizon

2130
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,400
Like Verizon business

2131
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
Individual

2132
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:33,728
You and I

2133
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,008
Cell phone owners

2134
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,800
They collected things through

2135
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
A different

2136
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,592
Part of Verizon

2137
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,640
This is

2138
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:44,992
I don't like that I don't

2139
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,528
But I do think

2140
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,576
That based on the law

2141
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,856
Based on

2142
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,880
I'm telling you

2143
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
I read

2144
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,928
These Court decision

2145
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,720
Yeah I know cuz you're a lunatic

2146
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,024
And I don't think that they

2147
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,560
The decisions were rocks

2148
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,096
I think the appeals court was right

2149
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,376
He didn't have the standing

2150
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,400
But at the same time

2151
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,936
The conclusion is correct

2152
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,728
The metadata collection isn't on

2153
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,752
Reasonable search

2154
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,592
So he was right and they probably stopped

2155
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Wink wink

2156
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,432
In a lot of ways

2157
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:21,088
I just don't want all the information we can find it has stopped

2158
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,624
Based on

2159
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,928
What were afraid is actually the truth

2160
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,512
Larry klayman is right on that count

2161
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:32,096
He's wrong about everything else

2162
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:36,448
Yep his claims that he beat the NSA in a court case is wrong

2163
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,800
He had a case where they agreed with him or they were inclined to agree with him

2164
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,360
Suspended judgment

2165
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
Anyway

2166
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
Let's get into it

2167
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,576
I'm spent most work

2168
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,624
I think any human being has ever done

2169
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,696
Here's where this next flip is where

2170
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:01,536
Larry klayman

2171
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,840
This clip

2172
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:08,192
Larry klayman tries to do a little bit of a dance or he has to be sure that he has

2173
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,800
The information

2174
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,848
Beyond Sunday

2175
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
V up

2176
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,664
Mother fobs other work Weathers

2177
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,968
Publishing things have been out there in federal court

2178
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:25,088
Showing the Trump was being surveilled

2179
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:27,136
CIA whistleblower based on income for

2180
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,464
Montgomery system for a long time

2181
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:38,656
Shepherd

2182
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:44,544
I apologize that was trying not to implicate himself

2183
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
So

2184
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
Yeah

2185
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,064
Larry breaking down

2186
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,368
He sees as Montgomery's

2187
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,768
Whatever just let's get into the meeting Botanas

2188
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,072
Unclassified Chaser involve dinner

2189
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:10,144
That really is a Rosetta Stone

2190
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
A while

2191
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
Bulshit

2192
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,232
And also

2193
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,536
Also on this episode

2194
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,816
Some guy

2195
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,120
Who's nickname is Esperanto

2196
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:46,496
I don't like any of those words you just survived the Benghazi attack

2197
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,800
Content

2198
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,104
Esperanto is the hero of Benghazi

2199
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:56,992
And is fairly reasonable but also pretty aggressive

2200
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,808
And at the end of the interview you said like

2201
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:03,136
If people are afraid arrest

2202
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
George Soros

2203
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
And they're afraid

2204
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,952
I'll do it

2205
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
I'll go and I'll do it

2206
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,792
So Alex later uses that

2207
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
As like

2208
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:15,168
George Soros

2209
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:21,824
That's not quite what he said we should arrest him

2210
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
Marine

2211
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:25,664
You know that's what he's like he thinks we should be arrested

2212
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,200
You ready to go do it himself

2213
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,016
They just being held back a real Marine

2214
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,344
Do we know that

2215
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
He's a real dude

2216
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:43,328
Oh he's a real dude I can't remember right now he's going on Alex Jones

2217
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,376
I can't remember his first name

2218
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:50,752
Seems like a pretty decent dude

2219
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
But they also he has probably been kicked out of only one quart

2220
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
Never allowed to be there

2221
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:07,648
He's had William Richard

2222
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,864
Larry klayman on

2223
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,912
We had a lot of gas

2224
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:19,680
Recently

2225
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,216
He has to man

2226
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,264
He's scrambling

2227
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:29,408
You scrambling also you can come here he's losing it a little bit

2228
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:32,992
I don't know maybe next week I will be different you know this this week

2229
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,808
You started with the at the end of the week

2230
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,368
Recovering right now you're listening

2231
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,416
I already did his big

2232
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,744
Pizzagate apology could reinvigorate him a little bit

2233
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,512
We'll see

2234
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:50,144
CIA contractor

2235
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,680
And

2236
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,264
47

2237
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:59,360
Over 600 million pages of information

2238
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,688
Again went the only evidence we

2239
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,968
We can find of him being

2240
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,504
A contractor at all is

2241
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,088
Creating that software that analyzes Al Jazeera

2242
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:13,440
Questionable weather in that capacity he would have access at all

2243
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,512
47 hard drives or 600 million

2244
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
Document If he if he

2245
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,096
Did they have all those things

2246
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,984
Crazy and he must have been going way outside of his way in order to

2247
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,776
I mean is massively illegal

2248
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
It's all good

2249
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,992
Is Larry klayman coming in

2250
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:39,296
Much like Mike zullo

2251
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
And

2252
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:43,136
Really trying hard to make sure that people don't think that

2253
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,760
Chicken committed a crime

2254
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:12,320
And what he told me was on there

2255
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,904
Was that there was

2256
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:19,488
156

2257
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,304
President Trump when he was a businessman

2258
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,144
Oprah

2259
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,824
The only time that he could have

2260
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,896
Possibly had access to NFL

2261
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:43,808
Is around. Of 2003

2262
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:46,368
Discredited

2263
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:50,464
Prejudice the FBI's investigation on him and found to be a fraud

2264
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,792
There's no way he would ever be able to get any sort of clearance after

2265
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:57,376
2003

2266
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,656
I'm listening

2267
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,496
That al-jazeera

2268
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,288
Did work

2269
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:05,824
Trojan Horse

2270
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
Enterprise

2271
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Consider this

2272
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,640
Right

2273
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
Like

2274
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
I'm listening

2275
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,088
Are the

2276
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:21,440
Which is the acronym Avengers

2277
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,864
From the very beginning

2278
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,912
Like from the very beginning

2279
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,704
Because the al-jazeera soft

2280
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
Montgomery

2281
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,288
Pinpoint

2282
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,872
Every level of government

2283
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,432
He is at

2284
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
Chile

2285
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,224
The guy who

2286
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:48,064
See the Occam's razor

2287
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,368
I don't like

2288
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:58,816
Ubly have information

2289
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,608
Stolen

2290
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,472
The early 2010

2291
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,032
He's working with Joe Arpaio

2292
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:11,616
And he has this database of Maricopa County

2293
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,176
Victims of bank fraud

2294
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,968
Which is now being repurposed

2295
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,296
As people who are being spied on including

2296
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,368
Alex Jones all this s***

2297
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,696
600 million sound so f****** made up

2298
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,000
Where do you get 600 million.

2299
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,304
Like genuinely

2300
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,072
What

2301
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,912
What area of the government other than maybe that bulk

2302
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,192
Metadata collection

2303
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,984
System

2304
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
Close to 6

2305
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
100 million

2306
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,104
And even if it was about meditate

2307
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Point-by-point

2308
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
GPS

2309
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,224
Location of that kind of

2310
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
So where would you

2311
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,296
600 million.

2312
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:54,112
And it would be like I said from

2313
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:55,904
14 years ago

2314
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:02,048
Is it is there even that much information in the f****** Library of Congress

2315
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:06,144
In The Archives of all the stuff

2316
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:09,728
I'm made of

2317
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,752
1 kajillion

2318
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,800
Jillian

2319
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:19,200
Important point is that Larry klayman is coming out as a lawyer

2320
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,736
Being on Alex Jones

2321
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,528
Discuss this

2322
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,088
Wyoming

2323
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,672
But he only has secondary knowledge

2324
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,488
He has no idea was actually in these documents

2325
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,024
It is illegal for him to know it.

2326
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
Exactly

2327
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:38,400
Rodger Stone

2328
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:42,496
Repeat that

2329
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,264
Yeah

2330
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:47,104
If these same games that are so it's propaganda

2331
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:47,872
Even though

2332
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,640
Right

2333
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:49,920
You got six

2334
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,944
100 million documents

2335
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
You're not going to take a look

2336
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,760
Come on man

2337
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,528
I don't know

2338
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
To make sure that it's real

2339
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,184
Be so scared

2340
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,304
You don't I probably run away that's why you don't buy my drugs

2341
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,632
Scream and run the other direction

2342
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,472
As everybody knows

2343
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
You take your Coke

2344
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,056
Pinky

2345
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,592
You put it into the

2346
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,872
You make sure that

2347
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,896
The kokusai quote

2348
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
So

2349
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
Confirming

2350
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,064
But he didn't

2351
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,088
Discuss

2352
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,624
With Devin Nunes

2353
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,720
Come forward with information

2354
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,768
And that's what we've done and we've

2355
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,448
Has has

2356
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:56,736
Coming forward and then some

2357
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,600
So either all of this is just

2358
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:07,232
Fantasy world live there's a possibility

2359
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:13,632
And that's where he shot and that's very confusing.

2360
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,960
Nunez is acting up

2361
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,544
The house

2362
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
Intelligence committee chairman

2363
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:29,248
Destroyed and if he is acting impact on this information that has its roots in

2364
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:31,808
Someone who has a complete

2365
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,832
Call man

2366
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,232
Nunez himself

2367
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:44,352
Came on again it said the document showed no indication of wiretap on Trump Tower

2368
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:50,752
I think all of this I think it's as like a zigzag of

2369
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
I'm shook

2370
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:54,848
Because there was that thing that came out the other day

2371
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,128
About

2372
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
Flynn

2373
01:54:57,152 --> 01:55:00,992
The inner of the meetings that he had with the Turkish ambassador

2374
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,016
About

2375
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,808
Extraditing

2376
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,832
This goolingoo

2377
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,904
Aw

2378
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,696
5 to be extradited

2379
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,512
Erdewan believes that this cleric

2380
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,816
Was responsible for the fake

2381
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
I'm pretty sure

2382
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,192
Totally

2383
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:23,008
So he wants this guy extradited and United

2384
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,568
Does not believe the appropriate

2385
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,360
Flynn was being paid

2386
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,896
To help expedite the

2387
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
Dick came out

2388
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:31,968
The meeting

2389
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,504
Between flame and

2390
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,576
And the Turkish Ambassador was also attended by Devin Nunez

2391
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,368
He was also there

2392
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,648
Really yeah

2393
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:43,232
So now we sit with the information might be.

2394
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,792
Because now

2395
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,816
Maybe

2396
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,120
Flint

2397
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:56,800
Yeah at this point on Sunday when we recording this it's still not sure

2398
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,080
There's indications in

2399
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:58,848
Sources

2400
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,664
Anonymous sources are indicating that he might have cut it

2401
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:09,088
A grain of salt

2402
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:13,440
But maybe this is

2403
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,208
The possibility

2404
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:19,328
It's possible it's not proven it's not definite

2405
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,608
The only part

2406
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,888
It's hard to swallow about him

2407
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,960
If you look at all of this s***

2408
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,008
Everybody would go down

2409
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,824
Yeah

2410
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,360
The entire

2411
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,384
Get taken down

2412
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
From

2413
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:36,224
The bottom not everyone

2414
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,784
Empower

2415
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,600
Big a deal as we think

2416
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:46,464
The truth is probably somewhere in between

2417
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,512
But the reality is that like

2418
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,536
All that stuff

2419
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:50,304
It isn't

2420
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,328
We can't prove

2421
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:58,496
We can prove that Nunez was in that meeting with flame at a Turkish Ambassador attacked doesn't look good

2422
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,776
Newness is in the

2423
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:00,544
Convulsed

2424
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,384
And newness has given Handy's

2425
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,176
With a little bit of prostate

2426
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,296
Disappearing the night

2427
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,576
Before he went to the White House

2428
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,624
Meeting with somebody

2429
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,160
Like there's a lot of stuff

2430
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,440
Real f*****-up

2431
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,720
Yeah so

2432
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,304
Government should be shut down

2433
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:25,120
My thought nobody should be allowed to do anything

2434
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:29,216
My thought is that I don't think he was meeting with Larry klayman that night

2435
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,544
But some of that stuff does relate to this

2436
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,824
I probably actually meeting

2437
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,592
With Larry Flynt

2438
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,872
It's possible

2439
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,320
He's one of those guys who I don't care if he's alive today so I have no idea

2440
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,088
He's done good work

2441
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,624
The Great

2442
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,464
Is essentially that a lot of his stuff

2443
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,024
Nunez's Behavior

2444
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
Walnut

2445
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,584
Singularly

2446
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,608
Motivated

2447
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,656
Montgomery information

2448
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,728
Pretty clearly I think on this episode

2449
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,496
Bulshit

2450
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,776
Or the title take

2451
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,896
I think part of

2452
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,688
His behavior was

2453
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,456
What's pi

2454
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,480
Clayman

2455
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,248
And Montgomery

2456
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:16,832
Also the conspiracy theory Community is

2457
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,368
The flame does a lot of

2458
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,392
Like on the Block

2459
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:24,000
Why are people investigating not Montgomery

2460
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,536
I just did

2461
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:28,352
Suck it even more

2462
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,400
Kind of even more interesting

2463
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Is that

2464
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,776
The Conspiracy Theory blog

2465
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
And yet at the same time

2466
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,080
It's hard not to look at

2467
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,360
Get reality and go

2468
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,176
Kind of conspiracy is happy

2469
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,968
Opening

2470
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:45,248
Confluence

2471
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,272
Idiots

2472
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,552
Happening

2473
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,832
The same time

2474
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,368
Weird coincidence

2475
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:55,232
Almost as likely as anything else

2476
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,256
I think he

2477
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,536
Justice like like

2478
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,816
Like with the Montgomery

2479
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,888
Those idiots believe that s***

2480
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,168
Like it's just as likely

2481
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,960
See what's going on right now is that everyone

2482
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,800
The f****** conspiracy

2483
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,824
Football

2484
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,848
Russia

2485
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,688
Bring up for a while and I'll just

2486
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,456
Deal with

2487
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Go to slightly

2488
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,832
Alex Jones

2489
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:21,856
Is b*******

2490
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,392
I don't want

2491
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:25,952
Paint with a broad brush all people who believe in

2492
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
Conspiracy theories

2493
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,256
It has the same

2494
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:31,072
People who are very smart

2495
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,192
The idea that we would be

2496
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,728
Entire conspiracy communities

2497
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,264
By attacking our

2498
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,032
Is unfair

2499
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:44,128
Make that assumption if we're not clear

2500
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:49,760
There's a lot of people who also believe Alex Jones full of s*** but believe in conspiracies

2501
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,552
There goes there are

2502
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,832
Chemtrails got a cam

2503
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:57,184
Sure there are not stupid crazy people in that world

2504
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,232
Unfortunately there is a lot of stupid

2505
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,256
Crazy people in that world

2506
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,096
Yes absolutely

2507
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,120
So this next

2508
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:09,472
Is Larry klayman explaining why this is a matter of

2509
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,264
Immediate importance

2510
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:14,336
Do something that has to be dealt with Now or Never

2511
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:16,384
Exactly like how we need to

2512
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:23,040
I will file three court cases about

2513
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,960
It's bigger than yours

2514
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:56,064
His life is

2515
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:00,416
Come forward

2516
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,952
Could just die from a brain aneurysm

2517
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,232
I'm dead

2518
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,656
Any moment he needs to be interviewed

2519
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:14,752
Now it's just trying to create a sense of immediacy about it

2520
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,520
It's also trying

2521
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,056
Create sort of a tragic

2522
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:20,640
Sekiro story around this obvious liar

2523
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,920
What possible reason

2524
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:24,992
I'd like to interview

2525
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:29,088
That's a good point, Robbins podcast

2526
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,672
I meant be here cuz I got a lot of questions

2527
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:37,536
Perfect

2528
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,120
First date

2529
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,912
Bistro or movie

2530
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:49,568
Bistro

2531
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,384
You don't have it I legitimately think I flashback to

2532
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,152
French classes

2533
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:57,760
I think my brain just like snack before midnight

2534
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,296
I love that movie

2535
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:08,000
Anyway Richard linklater

2536
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:22,592
Slip into talking a little bit more about Montgomery himself and brings

2537
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:24,384
Bijo Arpaio situation

2538
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
7

2539
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:31,552
You on Montgomery and

2540
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,840
People

2541
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,376
We have

2542
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,656
It's so easy

2543
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
Successfully

2544
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,496
It's so easy to destroy his credibility

2545
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,056
All it took was like

2546
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,592
Couple Google searches

2547
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:56,128
Again Google

2548
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
And just

2549
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:59,456
Couple like just read a couple artic

2550
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,784
Like it's not that hard you find this guy is

2551
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,808
Is a massive

2552
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,088
Snake oil field

2553
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,648
And if you wasn't

2554
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
Being used for

2555
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:10,976
Propaganda purposes I agree with you

2556
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,256
He would be fun

2557
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:14,048
It would be fun it would be like

2558
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:20,448
Is he going to make it there's a there's a there's always a part of me that's going to be on the side of the guy trying to f*** with

2559
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:22,752
With the FBI I think that there also is a narc

2560
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,032
Could type of that like

2561
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:27,104
Down-and-out two-time loser gambling loser

2562
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:32,480
Kind of guy who just like last for

2563
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:36,064
Whereas our culture we're all in Grain to pull for that

2564
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,624
Like we all want to see the little guy

2565
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,648
Strike out against

2566
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,672
The system

2567
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:41,952
And it's unfortunate

2568
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:45,024
That this little guy striking out against the system

2569
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,584
Is being used propagandistic Lee

2570
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,864
To support the cyst

2571
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
Yeah yeah

2572
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,472
It's like we all Robin Hood and they all wind up being.

2573
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,520
Robin Hood Robin Hood is working

2574
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,312
Before the sheriff

2575
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,848
Turns out

2576
02:03:59,104 --> 02:03:59,872
Yeah that's it that's all

2577
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,944
Murderous monster

2578
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,480
You know what we got to get back to

2579
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,248
Sheriff's being

2580
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,272
The most

2581
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:13,184
That f****** nonsense the sheriff's movement all that stuff for another day

2582
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,048
The hacker

2583
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,584
Who wrote the book

2584
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,888
About that involved

2585
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:28,288
Larry klayman as lawyer for Dennis Montgomery

2586
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,568
Sue this writer

2587
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,848
Was unsuccessful

2588
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,128
The case was thrown out of court

2589
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,688
Of course so now you coming

2590
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:37,248
You failed

2591
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:50,816
Somebody's going to do tonight

2592
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,824
Obama's immigration

2593
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,176
That didn't happen

2594
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,320
Which is why we're proceeding on a separate

2595
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:15,136
Sympathize with Surfer file

2596
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,160
He's a great man

2597
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:22,304
But I was just talked to him he's staying out of this

2598
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,632
Getting out of this is a great bed

2599
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:27,168
I automatically wish

2600
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
You lose

2601
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:34,848
You do not belong in this world you want hundred percent

2602
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:38,688
Or you're not at least you're not in touch with your own Humanity

2603
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:41,248
Alex

2604
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,296
I'll talk to her

2605
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,624
Our personal reason Arpaio said

2606
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:50,208
Montgomery's investigation was

2607
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
Junk

2608
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:53,024
That's a good reason to stay out of it

2609
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,072
So now I want to bring this back

2610
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:59,168
Phoenix news article that I was talking about earlier

2611
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
Right

2612
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:02,240
Play this out

2613
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,520
Again Robert Young

2614
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,800
Is the lawyer

2615
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,824
That's trying case

2616
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,384
According to reports

2617
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,456
Court in 2014 to outside experts

2618
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,296
Experience of the nsa's evaluated Montgomery

2619
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,576
For the Sheriff's Office

2620
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,880
And concluded that Montgomery was quote

2621
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,696
A complete and total fraud

2622
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,072
Young brought this up in court to Arpaio

2623
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,424
At least by November 2014

2624
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,728
You knew Dennis Montgomery was a fraud

2625
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,008
That's a question

2626
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,568
It was

2627
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,592
Putting it lightly

2628
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:41,408
Arpaio said

2629
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:52,928
That was putting it lightly Arpaio said noted they have been working they been working Montgomery

2630
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:57,024
So we decided to stop paying

2631
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:04,960
Young went on to present email records showing members of arpaio's team we're still in touch with Montgomery 4 months after

2632
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,496
For that into 2015

2633
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:12,896
What a law enforcement officer have to be incredibly stupid to continue working with someone known to be a

2634
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:14,432
Complete and total fraud

2635
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,200
Young ass

2636
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:20,064
Our attorney John Masterson

2637
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,880
How can you say that

2638
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:28,768
Okay technically that is

2639
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:35,936
I'm going to go with yes the answer is yes as humans is a fair question

2640
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:42,336
Probably

2641
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,640
Younger

2642
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:50,272
Reminded Arpaio April weather

2643
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:52,064
And never brought up

2644
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:52,832
The timeline

2645
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,368
Begin where the faxes

2646
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,904
With the weird type writing on the back

2647
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,464
Or other documents Montgomery had made

2648
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,000
That included judge snow

2649
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:04,096
Quote I never thought you asked me the question Arpaio said

2650
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:08,448
Do you regret not telling him those things that April young a

2651
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:10,496
Quotes in retrospect

2652
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:16,128
Maybe I should have brought it up but it never came to my mind at that time I'll talk tomorrow payos

2653
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,736
So

2654
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:25,600
Really not

2655
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,648
Really relevant

2656
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,416
Admitted in

2657
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:29,952
The disguises

2658
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:35,840
Complete and total fraud admitted

2659
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,680
After an essay

2660
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:47,104
Investigators evaluated his hard drives as a fraud

2661
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:47,872
Real pain fast

2662
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:49,920
You should be allowed

2663
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,712
How to prove in court that are paid

2664
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,760
I think it is

2665
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,296
A legal imperative

2666
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,112
The only reason I disagree is

2667
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,392
It's irrelevant

2668
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,160
Like that

2669
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:05,280
If you were to bring a court case specifically designed to

2670
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
Approved

2671
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,328
That it's relevant

2672
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,352
But because it's a

2673
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:10,400
Contempt of court case

2674
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,704
It's irrelevant to the matter at hand

2675
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,776
Dismiss are you an idiot

2676
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:22,176
Which I still love that the auto in the eventual death penalty

2677
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:26,528
You probably shouldn't unless you're in Texas

2678
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,368
At this point

2679
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,648
Play music

2680
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:32,928
You should ask

2681
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,976
I don't think

2682
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,000
He doesn't deserve it

2683
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:38,816
I'd like to see a court trial though

2684
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:42,656
I don't want any violence to happen to him except for

2685
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:43,424
Sanctioned

2686
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,192
Because of his ex

2687
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:50,592
Don't believe in the death penalty believe that again I want to be clear that me and Jordan know a ton

2688
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:52,896
One more news on this podcast

2689
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:55,200
Please look into Joe arpaio's history

2690
02:09:56,224 --> 02:10:00,320
Based on what we wanted

2691
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,088
Not even

2692
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:04,416
We had to edit some stuff out

2693
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,208
I nearly cried

2694
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:13,888
Painted we had to pause I had to go outside and walk around

2695
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:18,240
Just based on how bad to do this

2696
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:21,312
So please look into that again Arpaio the monster

2697
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,640
We have to get back to the matter at hand which

2698
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,688
Judith interview with Larry klayman where he at

2699
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:27,456
Insist

2700
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,552
And then beyond that

2701
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,600
He goes to lay the blame

2702
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,440
And all this s***

2703
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
On people who are no longer

2704
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,560
The current predicament

2705
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:43,840
Is the Fault

2706
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,120
Of people who have not been

2707
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,144
Involved

2708
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,192
For quite a while

2709
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,504
We'll check and I don't know what's going on but I don't know why that doesn't happen

2710
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:09,696
Are we clear

2711
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:16,352
Generally agreeable

2712
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,472
Should probably be aware that there is a

2713
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,080
Not

2714
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:31,968
Sometimes it's manipulative sometimes

2715
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:34,272
It goes both ways sometimes it is legit

2716
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,040
Sometimes it's not

2717
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,880
There's a very

2718
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:43,232
The message the message

2719
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,256
Important is that

2720
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:45,280
Intelligence community

2721
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,328
People a lot of the time

2722
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,352
But sometimes

2723
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,120
I mean

2724
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:50,912
You should look for evidence

2725
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,704
You should look for truth

2726
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,752
As opposed to

2727
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:56,288
Or disbelieving

2728
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,568
But things are said to you

2729
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,128
Take things as

2730
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:00,896
They come to you

2731
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:02,688
Look for

2732
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:04,992
Heaven Allah

2733
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:09,088
I've realized

2734
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,880
Legitimately

2735
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:12,672
Legitimately

2736
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,440
That was the

2737
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:16,256
Smoothest you've ever been

2738
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:23,424
You're right legitimately I'm getting to the point where I'm realizing that if I ever want this

2739
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:27,008
Does it take off I'm going to have to start mimicking some of Alex Jones's behaviors

2740
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,544
So I'm going to start

2741
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,312
Look for

2742
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:31,104
You dumbfucks

2743
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:36,736
Are really awesome and they're really cool I don't think that you guys already

2744
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,528
Maybe a couple

2745
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:45,952
So I don't know what is assuming we have like

2746
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,584
But I got to assume there's some Dum Dums in there

2747
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,168
This is why

2748
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:00,032
Cuz we've had a we had a rough podcast

2749
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:07,968
I have just learned more about Joe Arpaio deal understand where we're coming from

2750
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:10,016
Inform he's lashing out hypothetical

2751
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:15,136
Wednesdays Wednesdays is band therapy

2752
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:19,744
Anyway he blames Clapper and what

2753
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:23,072
I think

2754
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:35,616
National

2755
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:43,040
No longer in office

2756
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,856
Flapper is not

2757
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,904
Yeah

2758
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,184
Got to get rid of them

2759
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:55,840
John

2760
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:04,544
I think the example that Alex keep going back to is that

2761
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,848
Who's gone

2762
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,128
John Brennan

2763
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,920
Who I was

2764
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,760
When Trump got elected

2765
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:14,784
In between him

2766
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:15,808
Being sworn in

2767
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:17,600
He said that you should watch

2768
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:19,392
You should be careful about

2769
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,160
Things he says

2770
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:26,560
I mean

2771
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,864
Avocado

2772
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:29,632
Message

2773
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:35,008
I get I get where Alex is interpretation everything like a boy watch your mouth

2774
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:37,056
I don't like the way you said that

2775
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:43,456
I know that.

2776
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,224
That's the one talking

2777
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,808
I get where Alex takes

2778
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,832
Umbrage

2779
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:53,440
But I also would understand how anybody who's in the intelligence committee

2780
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,208
Is the steak

2781
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:56,512
Of the president running his mouth

2782
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:58,816
Are you can piss off foreign powers

2783
02:14:59,328 --> 02:14:59,840
Accident

2784
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:05,472
Well you didn't even

2785
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
Service you can do these things

2786
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:10,592
To install foreign powers that are out

2787
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,360
Deep

2788
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,944
Build Alliance

2789
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,248
And you can insult them

2790
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,784
And you should watch your mouth

2791
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,576
You should be really careful what you say

2792
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:23,904
Diplomacy

2793
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:26,720
We have a

2794
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,000
Department

2795
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,280
Hayirli devoted

2796
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Diplomacy

2797
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:31,840
And there's a reason

2798
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:32,608
You feel that

2799
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:33,376
Department

2800
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,400
People

2801
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:42,848
Who actually is

2802
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,128
Been quoted as saying he

2803
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:45,408
I didn't want the job

2804
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,176
And his wife

2805
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,224
Do it

2806
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:51,040
Yeah and then they have not stuff that

2807
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,112
Everybody

2808
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,160
Confused

2809
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:56,928
Frustrated

2810
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:01,792
North Korea

2811
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:05,632
Rr4 about you

2812
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:06,400
Like

2813
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,424
It's strange

2814
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:08,448
To be still

2815
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,472
Stats with domestic

2816
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,240
Policy

2817
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,520
When we are

2818
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:12,800
Get out of Syria

2819
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:15,104
Killing more civilians than we've killed in

2820
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,128
So long

2821
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,408
Repeat

2822
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,176
Non

2823
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:20,736
Like it's not even defensible the variability

2824
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,016
Terry Target

2825
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:24,064
Offended so many of our allies

2826
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,416
So many countries

2827
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,536
This clip is Larry klayman saying that everything in the world

2828
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,560
Essentially is Obama

2829
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:39,424
I'm certain

2830
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:48,128
I didn't he's talking about all this information that Montgomery has

2831
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:50,688
Looked at from before Obama

2832
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:59,136
Great I'll take your word for it later claiming guy who is

2833
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,160
Clearly

2834
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:01,184
Incredible

2835
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:12,448
Originally above Obama Soros

2836
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,752
Obama

2837
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:23,968
In other countries in the world

2838
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:29,856
Other countries executive

2839
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:36,000
Super unfortunate

2840
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:39,584
I had a pajama example like

2841
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,352
Brazil

2842
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:43,424
Recently had a coup you no other country

2843
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:50,080
The ones where they hold their leaders responsible Benjamin Netanyahu has never been held response

2844
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:54,176
Possible for any president

2845
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:56,736
Literally not allowed to run for

2846
02:17:56,992 --> 02:18:00,576
Is legally barred from running for the job

2847
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:01,856
He currently holds

2848
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:05,696
Doorly illegal

2849
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:12,096
Uses these two countries as an example

2850
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:14,912
The president needs to be held responsible for bulshit

2851
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,920
I think

2852
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:31,552
It's the FBI buying software based on Al jazeera's barcodes

2853
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:34,112
Yeah it's right up there

2854
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,440
Italian cuisine

2855
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:41,024
That's the last clip that I have for Larry klayman Centerville

2856
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:44,864
If you want to know more about him and you want him to

2857
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,632
Speak his peace

2858
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,912
Checkers

2859
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,216
You probably have

2860
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:51,264
I didn't look into that

2861
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,056
If you want to hear his

2862
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,848
Entire argument laid out

2863
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:57,408
I will link it on the website he has

2864
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:02,016
That just lays out his entire argument

2865
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,040
About Montgomery

2866
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,832
It's all lies

2867
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
But at least

2868
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:09,184
If you go there it's basically all the stuff I cut out from

2869
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:12,768
Cuz it's boring and a lot of it was covered by

2870
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:13,536
Mike zullo

2871
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,840
A lot of it is just repetitious

2872
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,376
Here is a fun

2873
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:20,192
Claim it doesn't say anything

2874
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,472
Because Alex

2875
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,520
Trying to

2876
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,080
Really desperately make you believe

2877
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:28,384
The people he has on his show are real

2878
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:30,432
Manchester

2879
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,736
Not Sesame Street

2880
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,760
Claymation

2881
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,184
We try to get it right

2882
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:46,048
No you don't but sometimes

2883
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:50,656
Fake Pizza Gastrology

2884
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:51,424
Peju

2885
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,216
Yeah so I mean like your guests

2886
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:59,360
To ninety-nine percent accurate is legitimately don't know how you would quanta

2887
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,128
Supply what for

2888
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,896
Percent your guess

2889
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:03,712
But I know that if there was

2890
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,992
99%

2891
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,016
Ambitious

2892
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:11,648
Ninety-nine percent

2893
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,928
I think the most

2894
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:15,232
Respectable new sources that I trust

2895
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,512
Have maybe 80

2896
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:19,840
75%

2897
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:23,680
Amazing to me

2898
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:27,520
Like I said I told you on the last episode of and reading foreign policy

2899
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:29,056
And a lot of 0

2900
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:36,480
A lot of stuff that I've been reading in the area it seems looked into

2901
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:40,576
But I still think they get things wrong for

2902
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:41,600
From time to time

2903
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:45,440
Of course it's every Citizen's responsibilities to take in

2904
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:46,720
Media and news

2905
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,768
Evaluate

2906
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:50,816
That's your responsibility

2907
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:54,400
It's not the media's responsibility to your right every time

2908
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,960
When they're wrong it is the responsibility

2909
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,728
To own up to

2910
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:00,288
Exactly correction

2911
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:02,336
And to make sure that everybody knows that

2912
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:05,152
Which place is like the New York Times Washington Post

2913
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:08,480
These sorts of establishment Institution

2914
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:12,576
Do on a regular basis

2915
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:15,648
Do as

2916
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:21,280
It's unfortunate because this weekend again Alex Jones

2917
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,048
Came out with his

2918
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:22,816
Apology

2919
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:31,008
Nope he never does and this is not evidence

2920
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:31,776
Density does

2921
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,312
Cuz even

2922
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,104
Package Within

2923
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:40,224
Throwing other news organizations

2924
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,016
But hey they said it we're reporting

2925
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:48,416
What you wanted

2926
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:55,328
Yeah and if they had done any do diligence they never would have reported any of this

2927
02:21:57,888 --> 02:22:01,728
About

2928
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:02,752
YouTube

2929
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:08,384
They're not about

2930
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:13,504
Episode

2931
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,272
Just kind of fun

2932
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:18,880
This one this one

2933
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:25,536
Has been he wasn't on the phone during the claimant interview

2934
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:27,072
Singing

2935
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:28,864
Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah

2936
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,656
Slightly racist Disney song

2937
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:32,960
This one is

2938
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:40,128
It's a good song though if you take the racist part out of it

2939
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,176
Oh my what a wonderful day

2940
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:42,944
Anyway

2941
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,480
What's an autocrat

2942
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:49,856
Tar-Baby in El Reno

2943
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,648
Drunk horse he was

2944
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:58,048
In the background essentially for the entire Mike zullo interview and then once Mike zullo gets off the phone out

2945
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:00,352
Jerome corsi has asked for a little while

2946
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:02,912
This clip

2947
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:03,936
He says this clip

2948
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,984
And it's one way of looking

2949
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:08,800
And when I explained

2950
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,176
I'm also powerful

2951
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:20,320
Either from high-level leaks or house

2952
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:29,024
What shows you are really On Target my friends

2953
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,680
What his everything we write

2954
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:36,448
Everybody

2955
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,728
That everything you write

2956
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,008
Nobody looks

2957
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:43,104
That's how I'm Target

2958
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:51,296
Right everything Paul Joseph Watson does everyone loves that

2959
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:56,928
Yeah you're you're like

2960
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,720
Conspiracy theorists conspiracy

2961
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:01,792
Terrace

2962
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:02,816
Even if

2963
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,096
Wonky

2964
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:10,496
Conspiracy theory community

2965
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,896
I realize that

2966
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,176
Well I mean

2967
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:18,944
So far we've

2968
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,248
Seen that Paul Ryan's walking this is wonky

2969
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,552
Absolute gym

2970
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,832
It's perhaps broken

2971
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:33,024
Generally I like to try and come up

2972
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,048
For something that

2973
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,584
I really sums up

2974
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
Appealing

2975
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:38,912
Nothing

2976
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:44,288
Next time listen to two-and-a-half hours of us talk

2977
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:48,384
The last 5 minutes

2978
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:50,432
We'll have a good clip

2979
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,272
Give us light

2980
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:56,320
Information of everything we've got

2981
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,088
Monster

2982
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:58,880
Liars

2983
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:04,768
Everybody involved with the Alex Jones Show is all of those

2984
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:06,560
That's pretty much what

2985
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:13,472
I think you did a good real brief summation imma try for a little more

2986
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:17,568
Who is that

2987
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,848
Joe Arpaio

2988
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:19,872
Complete monster

2989
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:20,640
He is

2990
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,712
Of racial profiling

2991
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
So much

2992
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:27,296
He is absolutely

2993
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:30,112
Terrible he was not being wiretapped by any information

2994
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:30,880
Is publicly available

2995
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:31,904
Deserve the death

2996
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,720
He had a confidential informant name

2997
02:25:34,976 --> 02:25:37,280
Montgomery who is a proven liar

2998
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:39,072
History of fraud

2999
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,632
History of Troy

3000
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,680
Set up people with fake documents

3001
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:46,240
Clearly

3002
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:48,288
His lawyer Larry klayman

3003
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:50,592
Is a complete islamophobic

3004
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,640
Has Pride

3005
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:53,920
Multiple times

3006
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:54,944
Frivolous lawsuits

3007
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,736
Against liberals kicked out of 2 quarts

3008
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,528
Forever for life

3009
02:25:58,784 --> 02:25:59,296
4life

3010
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:02,880
Not allowed to be quiet

3011
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,488
So these are the characters that we're dealing with

3012
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,768
Alex Jones take

3013
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:12,352
And information about an alleged

3014
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,632
Wiretapping

3015
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,936
Project

3016
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:18,496
That's been going on that allegedly have his phone

3017
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:19,776
Numbers

3018
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:22,080
Montgomery

3019
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:23,616
Could easily get that information

3020
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,408
Very mild hacking

3021
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,688
Which he is shown

3022
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,712
Through

3023
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:28,992
People

3024
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:33,600
History has shown that he is capable of

3025
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,392
Can write Bass

3026
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:36,160
Epic software in

3027
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,696
Yeah

3028
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:43,328
So what we have here is Alex Jones either willingly or unwillingly being

3029
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,096
Tricked

3030
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:46,400
Bye

3031
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:47,424
Pastor Joe Arpaio

3032
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,192
Crimes against

3033
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:51,264
And probably deserves

3034
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:55,872
Probably could get you a good deal on a Hyundai

3035
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,664
Amazing

3036
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:58,688
Probably

3037
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:01,248
So Alex Jones

3038
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:04,064
Alex Jones

3039
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:07,648
Do research into any of these things

3040
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:10,720
He is

3041
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:12,000
Truly

3042
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:14,560
What percent trying to lie

3043
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:20,960
In a way that we do stay only in the way that we've always had that kind of spectrum

3044
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:21,984
Fourth

3045
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:22,752
If

3046
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:24,288
Alex Jones has done

3047
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:25,312
Research into these

3048
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:27,872
We're one hundred percent

3049
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:28,640
That he is

3050
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,408
Flying ant

3051
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,688
Pedaling a false narrative

3052
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:32,480
If he is not

3053
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,016
Which to me seems

3054
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:34,784
Who's the more like

3055
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:35,808
Situation

3056
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:38,112
Because again all of the work you've done

3057
02:27:38,368 --> 02:27:39,904
All of the research you've done

3058
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:40,672
Seems like something

3059
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:43,744
So far beyond anything Alex Jones is capable of

3060
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,352
It hasn't taken me that long though exactly

3061
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,632
Even more

3062
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:51,680
To be honest

3063
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:58,080
We're not getting paid for the show I have a nine-to-five job is generally at 8

3064
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:59,104
26 job

3065
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,896
I'm at work

3066
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,944
A lot of my life and I can't be

3067
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,224
Spending time researching

3068
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:08,576
I have not been tearing my hair out researching this

3069
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:10,880
It's been pretty easy to find most of

3070
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:12,160
Disinformation

3071
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:16,256
It fits within the Alex Jones and what

3072
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,024
We know of him

3073
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:18,304
That he would not have

3074
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:19,328
Even the most

3075
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:20,096
Cursory of

3076
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:22,656
If someone comes to Jerome corsi

3077
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:24,448
And says I have evidence

3078
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,496
The Trump is being spied on

3079
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:29,312
Jerome corsi is going to write up an article

3080
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:30,592
And Alex Jones is going to

3081
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:32,128
To just implicitly believe

3082
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:38,528
But no matter what he's not going to do any research

3083
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:42,112
Recite any of that work

3084
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:43,136
And because

3085
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:44,160
Jerome corsi

3086
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:45,184
Is

3087
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:45,952
So

3088
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,488
Someone credit

3089
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:49,536
Nicole

3090
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:51,840
He just brings this b******* into the house

3091
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:52,864
So

3092
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:58,752
Tumi I fall on the side of Alex Jones

3093
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,080
Not

3094
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:04,128
Mafia.

3095
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,408
In this particular

3096
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:07,712
That's interesting

3097
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,992
Willfully misleading

3098
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:10,016
People in the way that

3099
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:10,784
He would be

3100
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,064
If he had done

3101
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:12,832
In any research

3102
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:13,856
Do any of these p

3103
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:16,416
Disagree with you just don't

3104
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
White turkey

3105
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:17,952
Ocala

3106
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:22,816
I think he willfully doesn't do the research because a part of him knows that if he did

3107
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,608
He would invalidate his unbelief

3108
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:26,656
Your objections

3109
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:30,496
Thank you

3110
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,312
Groups

3111
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,128
So

3112
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:37,920
Realistically

3113
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,224
What week what we end this with

3114
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,504
Is

3115
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:45,600
Trump was not being spied on in the West

3116
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,768
Narrative

3117
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,048
Who's pitching the entire week

3118
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,912
The idea that his phone number in Trump's phone number and all that was part of this database

3119
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,960
Is absolutely

3120
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:02,240
Retrieve

3121
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,776
I think firmly established

3122
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:05,824
It's like there's a

3123
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,592
Web

3124
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:10,944
Things it's built upon it by the week on this

3125
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:12,992
Do you have multiple interviews

3126
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:15,040
With people propping up this one

3127
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:16,320
It's complete

3128
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,392
Has confirmed

3129
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:26,816
And Trump was wiretapped Nunez is it least incredulous

3130
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,632
Prick

3131
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:30,656
In some way

3132
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:36,288
His behavior was altered by some of this information Nunez I would actually argue

3133
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,056
Is on

3134
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:37,824
Evil side

3135
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,104
Is on the evil specs

3136
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:40,640
Hybrid

3137
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:42,944
Lie especially if they order to protect

3138
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:44,224
In order

3139
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:45,248
But

3140
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,272
In the same way

3141
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,808
Use wagon to what he

3142
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:48,832
Thanks won't get

3143
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:53,184
Torn down

3144
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:55,232
If you were going to

3145
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,512
Lexus

3146
02:30:56,768 --> 02:30:57,792
50/50 horse race

3147
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,328
What's blank

3148
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,376
Who do you think you would rather

3149
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:02,656
Hit your worst to right now

3150
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:04,448
Paul Ryan or Donald Trump

3151
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:06,496
Proof

3152
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:08,800
Sophie's Choice

3153
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:13,152
Really

3154
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:20,576
No that's that's a no-win situation I don't hit my horse to either but if I had to choose

3155
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,112
You probably go Trump yeah

3156
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:24,160
I'm still

3157
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
Going to go with Ryan

3158
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:27,232
I would go Trump but

3159
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:28,256
Real

3160
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,840
Just because I don't want anything to do with Paul Ryan

3161
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:34,144
Once every couple

3162
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,424
Isaac

3163
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:36,704
Isaac

3164
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:38,752
I think Trump is a traitor

3165
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:40,800
Yeah but somehow I think Paul Ryan

3166
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,592
Absolutely

3167
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:45,152
So that I would go I would go with Trump

3168
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:45,920
But

3169
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:48,736
More about a knockout

3170
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:50,016
Your survival

3171
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:52,320
Who's the

3172
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:53,088
Mcusta

3173
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,112
More money

3174
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:55,648
Gyros

3175
02:31:57,696 --> 02:32:00,512
Play I think Ryan is going to

3176
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:02,816
I mean

3177
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,864
And then we go back

3178
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:06,400
To the

3179
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:07,168
Healthcare bill

3180
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,728
I would have booked

3181
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:11,008
Or the whole Healthcare

3182
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,288
I would have said that

3183
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,056
Ryan

3184
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,592
Outmaneuver

3185
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:17,408
Cuz the healthcare

3186
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:18,688
Was

3187
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:19,712
The most

3188
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:20,480
Unpopped

3189
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:21,248
Nothing

3190
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,552
Ever introduced into Congress

3191
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:24,576
Yeah and he

3192
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:26,368
Still put all of his

3193
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
Maybe

3194
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:29,184
Just maybe

3195
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:30,976
Idiot

3196
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:32,256
He's not a walk

3197
02:32:32,512 --> 02:32:36,096
He is definitely not like historical smart

3198
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:39,936
He's gone it's also interesting though because I don't I don't know really

3199
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:44,544
Research article about how

3200
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:48,896
Trump making a hard sell on the health-care bill ended up losing them

3201
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:49,664
10 votes

3202
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:54,528
Negotiate with folks

3203
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:56,064
Negative

3204
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:59,904
It's possible that Paul Ryan maybe could have pulled it off without

3205
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:01,184
Blustery tactics

3206
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,208
Look

3207
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,584

Don't even

3254
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:32,224
It's hard because

3255
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:34,016
Feeling like part of the reserve

3256
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:35,552

I can imagine

3267
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:57,312

3268
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:00,896

I am at

3280
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,424
The very low

3281
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:24,448
Putting the

3282
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:25,984
Smallest amount of what I can

3283
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:27,776
Because I'm soaking

3284
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Confused about how to

3285
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,104
All we do is

3286
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:32,896
And all we can do is

3287
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:34,432
Encourage people

3288
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,992
Call your representative

3289
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:38,016
Do everything a

3290
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:41,856
That's that's a small thing

3291
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:46,720
The ACLU I forwarded any other cause support

3292
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:47,488
100%

3293
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,584
You can that's what we want to encourage

3294
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,448
And then beyond that also and I'm guilty of not doing this all the time

3295
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,496
But like

3296
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:01,056
