Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
The altar of Sweeney Todd

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
What's Alex Jones

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan

9
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan question for you

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
Unexpected

11
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
As we all know

12
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,152
Mccreamy song

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
Right did the worst put on notice

14
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
Is that everything should be dreamlike and cream like

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Oh yeah

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
A GoFundMe that was raising money for apiary

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
Abortion access

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Logistics Group

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
And

20
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
The initial goal at $5,000 I thought that was unrealistic you are being very pie in the

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Guy with that 5K

22
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes and we hit it

23
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,200
Quite quickly no more than that

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
It's it's B

25
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,576
I can't thank people enough for their generosity is is at

26
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
I'm Blown Away by how how

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
Consistently I'm I'm surprised

28
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
By how great our listener

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Thank you all so much

30
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Search for

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
I mean that goal of $5,000 with the expectation that kind of like we're doing this until September

32
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,824
September know what to do

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,712
We keep it going until September or if we launch a new one at some point

34
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
I don't know

35
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,600
But there are some reviews of ice creams on there

36
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
I have

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
That's why people are donate I have been celebrating

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,792
The success of the fundraiser by eating some ice cream

39
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,912
Most recently as we recording this is the chocolate pretzel McFlurry

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,776
Right can't tell you what I think about it it's over on the fundraiser

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,872
Spoiler alert it sucks it's really bad

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Go to that GoFundMe page for the review of a McFlurry

43
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Blurry it's a chocolatey pretzel mix I've just spoiled the review

44
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
My bright spot Dan is in a similar vein

45
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Bye

46
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Today when you were reading their list

47
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,496
Breeding podcast

48
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,872

Tripsy

51
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,552
To join them for their 5:30 Central

52
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
You're much better at this than I am

53
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
And then later on after that will be doing the same similar thing with cognitive dissonance guys a lot of

54
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
Maybe too much

55
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
Play some other time

56
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,104
Kind enough to invite us to join them for their fundraiser stream

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
And that route 730 so won't be on at 5:30 and 7:30 and you can listen to us this morning I think his being placate

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,392
In between those two live streams we will actually be live streaming us

59
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
Throwing my couches off of the

60
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
Oh you know what we could do we could live stream an episode of Watch

61
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Magician

62
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
No we couldn't

63
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,519
Episode

64
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Alright

65
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
I want to come on you

66
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
I'll be happy to come on anytime

67
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
We have an episode to go we're going to talk about June 29th 2020

68
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Two interesting

69
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
This episode

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,911
Yes obviously there's some bigotry that will be flying around

71
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
For sure there'll be some things that are annoying

72
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
But this episode is actually kind of a palate cleanser

73
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
In Subway's

74
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
There is a narrative Arc to this thing

75
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
That does not come to a satisfying conclusion. But it's still

76
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Pretty fun

77
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Okay

78
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
It's so you know I think our Monday episode maybe a little bit

79
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
No obviously Rocky

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
VR territory.

81
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Tougher things

82
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
To take in

83
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
I think this will be a little bit to bit lighter

84
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Pause

85
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
But before we get to that let's take a little moment Jordan to say hello

86
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,847

Alex Jones is paying bill for his gummy worms

Play music

Sodomites

101
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean

102
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
I don't want

103
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Jesus Christ

104
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
Thank you so much

105
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
Today we're going to start off with Alex

106
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
Trying to get into some news

107
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
I think I think this is probably what he

108
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
He kind of wants to do as a news for the day

109
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
Just went live and Infowars.

110
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Come

111
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
He almost no attention here in the control Western

112
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
The organization of

113
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,503
New World Reserve currency is America commits economic

114
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Suicide

115
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
That report

116
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Next segment.

117
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
But also

118
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
He later refers to Bricks as brexit

119
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Sophia's

120
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
A little bit of a confused

121
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
So the story is about Putin saying that the brics countries would be considering creating a reserve currency from among their currency

122
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
But it's far from like a complete done deal

123
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
A reserve currency is basically a currency that many countries hold a bunch of in-store which eases the ability of those countries to do busy

124
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
When is International

125
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Currently that's the dollar

126
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
For much of the world

127
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
I've been turning somewhat for a while

128
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
What are the motivating factors were the brics countries do wanted

129
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,999
Create their own holding currency to the US froze at Russia

130
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
After Putin invaded Ukraine

131
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,119
Russia as well as other countries like China realized

132
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
And the target

133
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Could be them

134
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,751
MMA dendup moreless excluded from much of the world's mark

135
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
This talk

136
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,895
Of the brics countries making up their own basket currency is interesting

137
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
But it also isn't probably as apocalyptic as Alex

138
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
We making it out to be

139
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,111
It would be somewhat expand the influence of these countries economically and if

140
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
Might hurt us economically in terms of somebody

141
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,511
Possibly unfair advantage

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Due to that but they still heavy

143
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Huge way to go to

144
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Ketchup

145
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
To where the dollar is in terms of

146
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
International holder

147
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
Also Alex should be asking himself some

148
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,103
I know he's wishy-washy about China how they're going to working

149
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
For the devil one day and breaking away the next day

150
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,759
But he should be in favor of a brics currency for the most part

151
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
He loves

152
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
Amphibian bricks is Brazil

153
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,695
Who's President bolsonaro is one of the only world leaders that Alex supports

154
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
He should be on that team

155
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Yeah that's his deep well I mean

156
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
The problem is the enemy of my enemy is not always my

157
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
My friend

158
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
But then when my enemy is also my best friend and my friends enemy is there

159
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
And my friend

160
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Is my enemy

161
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Then you're f*****

162
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
So what is

163
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,783
Bricks to you

164
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
See now we're screwed

165
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
So make it British

166
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Yes of course

167
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Ecuador

168
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Ecuador

169
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Not much of a handle on this. What's going on

170
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
Video about this that Alex season is like

171
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,335
List of things that I could touch on and so that's going to play that record

172
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
It's another headline to

173
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
Zelensky demands 5 billion from a

174
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
For security in Europe whatever that mean

175
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
So much

176
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
Insane news breaking on the Ukraine front

177
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
This is one of those great instances where it becomes really clear that Alex doesn't prepare for his show at all and he just cold reads head

178
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Blinds that makes things up about them

179
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,983
This headline doesn't say Sidious but Alex's misread it and the pigs

180
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Fast on his feet

181
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
He throws I'll be whatever that means to imply that selenski has said something weird like he wants money from NATO C

182
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
Natural headline here is quote

183
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Zelensky demands 5 billion from NATO

184
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
Sites Security in Europe

185
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391

186
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Does not get back to this story either

187
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,423
It is kind of amazing you really wouldn't hear from any actual news person

188
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,311
Whatever that means after reading out his story that you've chosen

189
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
Clearly one of your lead stories

190
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,271
Starting off the show with like this is something we're going to get into whatever that f****** means

191
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Next

192
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
We're going to talk about 8

193
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
B161 whatever the f*** that s*** is who knows

194
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Will get back at you

195
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
What are the reasons that I like so

196
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
It's kind of like

197
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Not going to go back

198
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
The news is

199
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
It's got the the man Rodger Stone

200
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Coming in

201
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
And Rodgers been done dirty

202
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
Okay alright they did him dirty

203
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
Rodger Stones going to be joining us exclusively at the bottom of the hour

204
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
You're about 23 minutes from now

205
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,391
Rodger has been massively defend against Elijah

206
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Claiming the Trump called him

207
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
I told Mark Meadows to call him and 2

208
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
You called

209
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
General Flynn

210
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
Plan what happened at the Capitol

211
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
This is absolutely ridiculous

212
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Did not call Rodger

213
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
Mark Meadows did not call Rodger General Flynn it is

214
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Made up

215
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Why

216
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
I've had

217
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Grand jury

218
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
About a phone call

219
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Supposedly had with

220
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Stone and Flint

221
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
The phone call

222
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Cuz you know that you got my damn phone.

223
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
So this is to do the testimony provided by Cassidy Hutchinson

224
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,663
And who was an aide to Mark Meadows Trump's chief of staff

225
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Underoath

226
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
She testified that quote I'm under the

227
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,551
The impression that mr. Meadows did complete both a call to

228
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Mr. Stone

229
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
And general Flynn the evening of

230
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
She couldn't defend it really say that the calls were made and there's no direct evidence that these calls were a plan for the riot the next day

231
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,887
But in her capacity as Meadows AG knew that her boss was told to contact

232
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Stone and Flint

233
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
And it was $0.04

234
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
But he has

235
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,335
Alex is getting close to why the committee might be interested in

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
Been talking to him no more it's not really

237
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Maybe about his actions on the 6th

238
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
He released an interview with General Flynn which he filmed on the

239
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
The evening of January 5th

240
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
If you watch that interview there's a number of Clues

241
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
About where that interview might have been filmed

242
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
41 there's a painting behind

243
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Flint which is a reproduction

244
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Samuel morse's painting

245
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Sing the House of Representatives

246
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
Which is firmly

247
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
In fitting with the decor of the Willard Hotel Rudy and all those folks had their war room

248
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Anticipated

249
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
There's a painting

250
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
And it's definitely not the original of this painting because that's in the National Gallery

251
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
You can tell by the acoustic

252
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
But it's not that

253
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Not in there

254
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Additionally that evening

255
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,607
Flynn was photographed with Rodger stone at the Willard Hotel wearing the same clothes that he's wearing in the interview that he did without

256
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,215
Finally Alex Rodger and Flynn all spoke at the same event that Eve

257
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
Also speaking at night where Jack pasovic

258
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
George Papadopoulos

259
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
And Ali Alexander

260
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,407
Who introduced Rodger and took a

261
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,247
Special moment to thank him for being the force behind stop the steel

262
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
That's a bad

263
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
That's a bad look

264
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
In retrospect

265
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,903
Alex was there at the Willard Hotel that evening

266
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Based on everything I can

267
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Until

268
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
Really seems like that interview took place

269
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
At some room at the Willard Hotel

270
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
That's not good if I were him I really wouldn't want to testify either not because I suspect that he's actually knowingly and

271
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
Involved in any plot but because of the fear that I might

272
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
Accidentally offer up some detail that

273
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,175
Super damn 100% that probably doesn't know

274
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
He knows that's dangerous to his Allied

275
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
But he knows that all the people who aren't

276
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Caulking around tonight

277
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
Shouldn't ocular salute

278
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,023
Rudy and John Eastman are talking Rodger and Flambeau plead the Fifth

279
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
He's doing that to Alex man like

280
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Nothing weird happened

281
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
What time did you go to the bathroom 8:15

282
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
Totally what would happen if we get jammed up by some

283
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Document

284
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
That's my

285
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,343
It's kind of my feelings be asking about a phone call that he had with them

286
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
Because based on the evidence he was with

287
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Exam on January 5th

288
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
He's right there if not at the Willard

289
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Which I'm pretty sure that interview was at the weather

290
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
If not there

291
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Then rally that they all spoke

292
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,335
Where Alex Galvan have tomorrow would be the globalist to Waterloo

293
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
It really seems like you knew what was going to happen does

294
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,503
Also I was watching back through that rally and it's really funny

295
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Ali Alexander introduces Rodger Stone

296
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
And then a rap group

297
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Comes out

298
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
I use that term very Loosely they come out and do the Rodger Stone did nothing wrong

299
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
Rogers up there like a

300
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Pinstripe suit looking like a f****** huge melon

301
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Vanilla extract

302
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
TMNT to happen for the good life

303
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
For the turtle

304
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Are there more raps about turtle

305
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
High tide time will tell. Only

306
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
Hutchins

307
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Open testimony

308
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Really

309
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
A problem for a lot of folks

310
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
I thought you kind of just have to fight back

311
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Bob with a badger sound like

312
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
She's made everything I have course

313
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Reason Rodger join us not just that

314
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
The wheels have come off their deceptions

315
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
This Cassidy

316
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Hutchinson

317
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
That's why I sound

318
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
Trump

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
So she's gotten angry

320
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
And made all the shop

321
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
None of this is true

322
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
No such thing happened he didn't plan of the from the car and grab the wheel

323
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
None of this is truly sitting way in the back

324
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
She Wrote This handwritten note

325
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,007
On what Trump directives were on January 6th and it turns out she didn't

326
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,591
They've already got other testify to that I mean the woman is a

327
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Liar

328
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,247
We just see this going on and on and on

329
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Committing crimes Underoath

330
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Come out

331
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
But still didn't call her on it

332
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,167
The matter of this handwritten note has to do with a note that was on Meadows stationary and it was a message that they wanted

333
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Trump to get out

334
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
That was essentially that everyone should go home

335
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
Trump lawyer Eric herschmann claims that it was actually

336
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Play He Who wrote the note not Hutchins

337
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
I don't think this matters as much as Alex thinks

338
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,599
Like for one thing Hershman isn't saying this under oath and he's Trump's lawyer so I don't know how seriously I want

339
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Sacred flame

340
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Also

341
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
This is kind of

342
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
It kind of makes things look worse

343
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
For Trump

344
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
In essence you have two people

345
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:14,911
One witness his own lawyers who were saying that they wrote an o with a message for him to tell the rioters to go home

346
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
And yet he did nothing

347
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Kind of looks weird

348
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Well I mean if you get a note from an aide

349
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
That says tell everybody to go home perhaps

350
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
If you look at it and you say

351
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Who gives a f*** with

352
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Does AIDS fake right

353
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
But if your personal lawyer gives you a note

354
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
That maybe makes it look more like you should have listened

355
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
I think that story about Trump trying to commandeer the vehicle so he could join the Riders that's an interesting image

356
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,263
It's important to keep in mind that all Hutchinson was testifying to is that she heard that story

357
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
From Tony ornato

358
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
The Deputy Chief of Staff

359
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,919
The secret service has disputed this event happened but are not OS

360
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Not to this point disputed

361
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Telling the story

362
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Hutchinson

363
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,111
There are threats to untangle here but honestly this was kind of off the beat

364
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,743
Important about that bass testimony

365
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,351
Looks like Alex have to deflect from other really damning stuff that come out

366
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,935
Alex I probably go this route to not because it's wise

367
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Because there's no

368
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Really much else you can do

369
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
You know the problem with

370
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
That is

371
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
That salacious typed

372
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Detail of

373
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
All the president

374
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
Trying to strangle a secret service agent

375
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Get you f****** headlines

376
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Times for sure sure

377
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
But

378
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
That's Alicia s*** is what the right

379
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
Feeds off of it gives them strength the game like

380
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,999
Magical electricity Powers being able to

381
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
To focus purely on that and not on anything of any

382
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,679
Yeah it's it's unfortunate that you're getting headlines and attention

383
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
I realize I'm having interesting thing

384
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Jeff and

385
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
That's the only way that

386
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
They do this this propaganda machine confunkshun

387
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
It's just dry analysis is really boring Alex can't do anything with that

388
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
Literally just like sequence of videos

389
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Place with evidence

390
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,695
And 0 eyewitness testimony at all really

391
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Yeah I just like

392
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
This is what

393
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
And we have the

394
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
Exact timeline of events have you ever noticed that Alex has never read off like a legal document or a bill

395
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,239
Are you bored by that I can't do chitlins

396
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Adam Schiff

397
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
Is on this January 6th

398
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Committee

399
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
And we also know that he is still needing to feel

400
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
We're still waiting years later

401
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
For him to feel his hand

402
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
But yeah he's a known liar

403
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Is that Alexa has

404
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,023
Proven I guess not really but anyway he he's making phosphate

405
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
But I guess it's really

406
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
Peas in a pod or birds with feather fly together

407
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Because you have shift on the committee

408
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
We know of

409
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
I'm sure there's more

410
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,943
Totally falsified documents and emails and change the words around

411
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
To say something completely different

412
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
She's testifying she heard Trump say

413
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,903
I want to join an armed Insurrection and take the capital of her

414
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
10000 National Guard

415
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,704
Alex knows damn well that shift didn't do that the Trump didn't order security for the capitol on January 6th

416
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
These are just well-worn talking points

417
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
He's repeated enough of the audience assumes they must

418
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Keep saying this

419
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Years are we on

420
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
For this

421
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
The irony is that he's accusing Schiff of falsifying statements but

422
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
He's actually doing the exact same thing as it relates to Miss Hutchins

423
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
He never said the Trump wanted to join an armed Insurrection and take over the capitol

424
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
That's a Alex's

425
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,608
Also in terms of other witnesses that Trump wanted to join the protests

426
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Alex himself had said that was

427
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
The plan

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Trump said he was going to

429
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
Going to do that from his speech at the ellipse

430
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,872
During the very Committee hearing that Alex is covering they played recorded testimony

431
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
From Trump's former press secretary Kayleigh mcenany

432
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Who said quote

433
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:17,344
I believe when we got back to the White House he said he wanted to physically walk with the Marchers

434
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
He wanted to be a part of the March

435
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
In some fashion

436
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
So I mean

437
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
There's plenty of people who definitely

438
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
10.2 the appeal

439
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Intend

440
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,888
Sure sure but you know it's more

441
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Fun

442
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
If you really lean into the fascist element of just telling people to think that they absolutely saw in Kansas

443
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
See at any point in time they want did next

444
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
Oh yeah that's really important later this

445
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
The good trash

446
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
That's when you know you're getting

447
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
The Rodger Hopsin

448
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,672
Hello I'm Rogers

449
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Around

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
She alleges that the president

451
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
Told his chief of staff

452
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Mark Meadows

453
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Call me and general Flynn

454
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
January 5th

455
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
To discuss

456
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Oshkosh

457
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
What was going to happen

458
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
I never spoke

459
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
2

460
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,856
Miss Hutchinson only said that it was our understanding that the calls were made

461
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
Her testimony

462
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,696
Still be completely accurate with

463
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
No Lie

464
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,584
Also Rodger is making up which he's testified about going to like why the calls

465
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Those were made

466
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,216
Rodger claims it so they could tell the Trump what was going to happen on the 6th

467
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
Asked directly quote

468
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
Do you know what they talked about that

469
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
To which she replied

470
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
I'm not sure

471
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Liz Cheney asserts that quote

472
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,784
The night before January 6th President Trump instructed his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows

473
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
Contact both Rodger Stone and Michael Flynn

474
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
Regarding what would play out the next day

475
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,232
This wasn't necessarily based on any testimony provided by Hutchins

476
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Then they could be

477
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,328
From other investigation that was carried out by the committee

478
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
Rogers problem is with Liz Cheney but the goal for the right-wing media right now is to do whatever they can to Moline cast

479
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Hutchinson

480
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
So her testimony isn't taken seriously

481
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Rodger takes

482
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,200
Words that she didn't say and describe them to her in order to further that goal

483
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
Roger's been at this game for a long f****** time he knows exactly what he's doing this is just

484
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Bulshit

485
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,952
It's sad it feels like there is hard isn't it quite

486
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
The same way any

487
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
He doesn't take that thing Glee with

488
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
With a complete piece of s***

489
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
He doesn't seem as angry

490
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:41,472
No Andy has to pretend he believes in God all the time

491
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
It's not

492
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Yeah there is something else

493
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Guess when you've been to prison

494
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:51,200
You're delivering only by the like gray so he home

495
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,088
There is maybe a wake-up call. Like maybe it's not so fun to be the Joker

496
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Thing I've done

497
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah now that I'm living with the

498
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Consequence

499
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Says I'm starting to think

500
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Hold on

501
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
When I was

502
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Reaping

503
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
I was like

504
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Hahaha this is

505
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
Great and then I started sewing and someone was like

506
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
Stop that you're fine

507
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
I was sewing my consequence actually

508
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Twice

509
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
So anyway

510
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
List Hutchinson she's just

511
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
But angry former

512
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
Wow you talk about Reckless

513
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Yes

514
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
She said all these things

515
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,608
After this. Where she makes all your assertions against

516
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,704
She was seeking to join his staff at Mar-A-Lago she was speaking to

517
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,808
Does the disgruntled employee know nothing to see here

518
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
Who is Intuit

519
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Okay

520
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
You can't

521
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Both be an employee of trump

522
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
And

523
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Be

524
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
Not described

525
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,512
True

526
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
Do any employee who speaks out against him

527
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
A disgruntled employee

528
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
I think he's any employees if you have

529
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
A three-tiered thing

530
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,568
You have current employees who are afraid to speak out

531
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,968
You have people who are respecting their NBA's that they were forced into it I don't say anything

532
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,576
All three of them can testify to the same information

533
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
Most likely

534
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
You can be a disgruntled employee and definitely tells

535
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
The truth about your disgruntled

536
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Honesty that's

537
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Why you pay people off

538
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
That's the whole thing

539
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
Does he give you a lot of money because you're disgruntled

540
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
And you can either tell people what your

541
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
You're distracted about

542
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
You can get a lot of money

543
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
I don't have any /

544
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
Particular reason to distrust the account that be such a

545
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
Some gave you don't have any

546
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
Particular reason the evidence

547
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
It's being thrown around by people like Alex is not compelling it anyway

548
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Heather is a debunking

549
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
But I also am not

550
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,376
Getting all up in like the key grab the wheel hysteria smell like

551
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,424
It's not it's not

552
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
It's not worth it

553
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
To get really excited about these vibrant images how many times are we going to do this

554
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,896
Oh man that's just too good

555
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
True

556
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah

557
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,504
We don't need more of that

558
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
It said it's not productive

559
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Nope

560
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Play some social media while though

561
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
It really does Alex like

562
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
He's going to break down this f******

563
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Committee

564
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
Mnic

565
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,056
Sure sure if you want to hear the evidence that proves the things that I'm arguing against you can go find

566
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
This is not a court of law my friend that's also it's just

567
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
I don't know you're responsible but it's

568
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Glaring videos

569
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
I'm going to get into this immense like you with that

570
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
Especially not

571
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
The stuff he doesn't

572
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
So we all Rodger

573
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,072
Freedom for all animals of the sea

574
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
No

575
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,752
The purpose of this is just a relay

576
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Warriors

577
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
Show for me this means bigger and bigger legal

578
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
I've already as you know

579
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
That my legal obligations under their subpoena but I pledge

580
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Because I have anything to hide

581
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,744
Extensive experience

582
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,072
Jewish immaterial irrelevant

583
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
Into a crime

584
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
Hey buddy that's not what the 5th is 4

585
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
Do cats purr when you have

586
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
Probably done a crime

587
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Isn't just like

588
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Hey you never have to say you never have to answer Eddie

589
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,736
It's

590
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
Views of the amendment

591
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
I think that this is

592
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
Just sad and obviously a fundraising opportunity for them

593
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,816
I think it's very funny that ND

594
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Hyper

595
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Masculinize

596
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Toxic

597
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
Bulshit like

598
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
How strong you have to

599
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
To being dominant and all that stuff

600
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
I'm a warrior

601
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
For me that means

602
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Higher legal fees

603
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
Do I do appreciate the absolute deflation of being a warrior

604
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
What does pays an extra 10%

605
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
The price of my b******* going on inflation baby

606
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
So here's where everything turns

607
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Yeah

608
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
And what I say turn

609
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
On a dime

610
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Oh man

611
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Cuz this

612
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
S*** goes nuts

613
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
2024

614
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:14,528
I think he announces sooner rather than later

615
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
I think these kind of

616
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,392
Probably accelerate

617
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,232
Odyssey just needs to stick to his

618
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,864
Before he could move out openly and frankly I do think he is sizing up

619
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,776
New National poll last week block and Associates in the Gateway pundit shows that Trump

620
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
Easley dispatches all-comers

621
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,152
Is his race to lose

622
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:46,272
Five more minutes weather in God's name

623
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
Launch

624
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,488
This is too hot wow I have got my first

625
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
Actual exclusive story that no one knows about

626
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
And the only person telling it to me is notoriously liar rogerstone and he's not even really

627
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
Telling you it's not news

628
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,200
Will become the rest of the show

629
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,064
Of course it will

630
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,952
Spend the rest of the show obsessed that he has the scoop of course

631
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,000
And it becomes that he's going

632
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
To announce

633
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
On the 4th of July

634
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
They're saying

635
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay this Monday

636
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Trump is going to announce his candy

637
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
Tennessee for 2024

638
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
Almost entirely the rest of the up

639
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,552
Now the more I think about it the more it really does make sense in like a

640
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Cinematic way

641
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
Everything's a movie to these people

642
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
You do it on the 4th

643
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,512
July and then for us we get the added irony of recognizing that in the flag of

644
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Freedom

645
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Is fashion

646
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
It'll be great

647
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,144
Am I also think that it's on brand with like just how

648
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,496
Flagrantly disrespectful it absolutely

649
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Self-aggrandizing especially

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Yeah

651
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Let's think about

652
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,040
I mean hijack the news cycle on the 4th of July and make everyone talk about me

653
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
Let's remind everybody on 9/11 I had the biggest building

654
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,696
Things in case anybody was wondering his brand

655
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
Of the

656
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
I don't know

657
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
I would not be

658
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
That surprised if it had totally totally but

659
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,264
I would not Bank on it based on

660
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,848
Oh no I don't think I'm sure has some inside information

661
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
If you are throwing out

662
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
Movie pictures which is what Rodger was doing

663
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
Then that is a great pic

664
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Eagle Fence

665
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Betty White

666
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Trump wasn't gonna run

667
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Oh now

668
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
But now

669
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,096
Rodger Stone help prime the pump to get

670
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
President-trump

671
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
First rule of Fight Club

672
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
Iran president

673
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
He told Rodger and many others just now come out

674
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
Six months ago

675
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
What's the second rule of Fight Club

676
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Yeah

677
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,912
I don't know how many others to Lagoon

678
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
Feel it growing

679
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
Play within the last

680
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
5 minutes of him hearing Rodger

681
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
You say that and him think

682
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
Think about it 45-second imagine

683
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
30 other voices in his head God I can't believe that Trump is going to run start with a story

684
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
Feel-Rite

685
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Absolutely

686
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,952
It's just expanding of proving the Dell as we speak

687
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,864
Trump

688
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Trump is intending to declare

689
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
2024 Ron on cell.

690
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
Rodgers said

691
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Aftergold

692
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Flexibility

693
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
When you get a big giant

694
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
Kahuna news-record like that

695
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
Oh my God

696
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,144
It's like Elvis's got Marilyn Monroe in the bed and they're about to

697
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
What

698
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,752
Is this is this or is this not a family show

699
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Elvis

700
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Tired or just

701
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
Really on a lot of barbiturates

702
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
I don't know I don't know what he's talking about me

703
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,480
F****** obvious

704
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
UK so

705
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
Texaco flexibility thing or I won't or I don't

706
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
If this does not happen

707
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:19,168
I'm still right

708
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:25,056
Kahuna story totally no one and no one else has this gluccie totally I'm going

709
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,480
Going to get all the press for this bright but also I should tell you it might not happen

710
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
Not announce on the 4th of July that's because

711
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Cuz technically

712
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,648
That wasn't the best mood right and maybe this is not news maybe it's

713
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,720
Not even gossip maybe the level below gossip

714
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Rodger

715
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
Liq

716
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
S***

717
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Available

718
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Cowboys

719
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
You make everything up

720
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
On your own

721
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,664
So you think whenever you talk to a man who's a champion make a rapper of everything on his own

722
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
I'll be like maybe he's making

723
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,856
You you gotta understand though I think Alex really didn't have anything to talk about

724
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
And two keys Federal Way

725
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
F****** excited

726
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
On July 4th

727
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,864
Run

728
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
You talk about blood coming out of the eyeballs of the left

729
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Insane

730
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
So I'm glad

731
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
But here's the deal

732
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
What's

733
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
May make

734
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Decision

735
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Tactical flexibility

736
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Not tuna

737
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,616
No

738
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,296
On air at this moment everything is true and false at the six

739
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:17,696
Okay so there's a presidential run in a box

740
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:22,048
Claire's or not

741
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
Also man when you say Rodger Stone isn't a bullshiter

742
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
I am trouble

743
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
If you say that you been

744
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Lightning should strike you

745
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,408
That is the one thing where if there is a God you just can't say that

746
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Bright I think that if

747
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
I don't know I'm trying to think of

748
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Anybody that I respect

749
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,648
Return to imagine them being ignored

750
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
Crystal Dupre straight-up guy

751
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
I would instantly

752
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,048
Call into question everything I've ever said

753
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,888
Could not be worse process to think that you should

754
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
Say that out loud to me

755
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
That is something that if I'm around you you

756
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Buried under a rock

757
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,384
Outside not be a greater bulshit

758
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,224
The legendary right that's insulting to him

759
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
It's a decoration of his

760
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
Career as brand is legacy

761
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Hazel

762
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,952
Champion bulshit he is a historical

763
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Bullshiter

764
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
He'll go in the record books

765
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
So look elsewhere the rec

766
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Alex's famous Wok

767
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
On the Greenbelt

768
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Those are

769
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,496
It's been awhile since we've heard about launch

770
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
Really cool fossils although

771
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Time cool

772
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Conch shells

773
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
Huge beautiful houses

774
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
The Clemson thinks it's either shape

775
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
So I'm hacking long

776
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,536
Scrabble up

777
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Embankment up to that

778
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Old here

779
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Good story

780
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Define

781
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Advil

782
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,600
I'm just processing report

783
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Done

784
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
Processing

785
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,304
Trump is going to run and then announced on July 4th right

786
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
He's got a gun to your head

787
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
What

788
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
But he's got it locked and loaded right now about the

789
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Bontrager

790
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
And so

791
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Yeah

792
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
I mean

793
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
That's a whole nother subject

794
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
In fact

795
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
We got Alex Stein who went to New York and left

796
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
Shut down a free speech we got incredible videos

797
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Call Brad

798
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
All-time situation

799
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Yeah man

800
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
You got to clear the deck

801
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,240
You got you got this kind of big news

802
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
You got a you got a not talk about all of us

803
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
The things that you spent

804
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,408
1520 hours of work preparing for

805
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
You got to throw all that out the window because

806
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Is this

807
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
If this is

808
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
Career-making

809
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
News breaking

810
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Don't

811
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Understand

812
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
Even if it is

813
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,608
Then you're just telling me right now that a man we all knew was going to run for

814
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Six or seven months

815
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
Citgo probably was going

816
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Emily was going to

817
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
You're saying that yes he's going

818
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
And then he'll say it

819
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,408
Official I guess I mean that really news here's here's the two things that I can think of

820
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
That like would be exciting about

821
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
1

822
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,296
Is now you actually have to have a conversation of

823
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,088
We actually support Trump

824
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Sure and I think that could be difficult

825
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
To have with Alex's Auto

826
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,232
Because a lot of them have turned on him

827
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
A lot of them

828
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
And now it's your turn.

829
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,328
And then come back as a doctoral candidate

830
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:12,192
So there is that like we really have to figure out where we are

831
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
And that could be child

832
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,824
And then the second thing is the notion of doing it on the 4th of July

833
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,408
I think there's a troll excitement that Alex is getting

834
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,224
With like oh my God that'll piss off a live

835
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,624
So much I think that is a big part of the in a lake

836
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
He's really going

837
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Going to

838
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,512
Isn't that fun

839
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
That is the fun I mean

840
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
Yeah of course he's going to run and he's going to win by a

841
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
Billionaire he gets to say

842
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
To the right wing

843
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
For the first time ever

844
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
I delivered

845
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
On Roe v Wade

846
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,455
Well nobody else gets his head I appointed the three lunatics

847
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,087
Who throw their own feces up in the air and watch it land on paper and call that there

848
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
I think that he delivered

849
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
Yeah I think you come

850
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
2A

851
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Serta very weird

852
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Thing about that like

853
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Taking credit

854
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
You can

855
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,887
The justices

856
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Yeah that did it themselves

857
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
But he appointed them

858
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Yeah but

859
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
I think you could make an argument to Mitch

860
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,127
McConnell really has more total there was not running

861
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,687
President know that's true

862
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
People

863
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
To run for president

864
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,319
And get all of that attention you have a grand old time with it

865
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:38,719
You're so powerful mr. Trump

866
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
Very attractive too

867
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:46,143
Walk of the Republican base can you imagine if Obama delivered on universal

868
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
So Healthcare in 2009

869
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
We would have amended the constant heat still be f****** present if you ate any politician it delivered on f****** and

870
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Anything in the past 30 years

871
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Pahrump

872
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
Also some other news that he's going to try to cover

873
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
I'm too excited

874
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Really even pay attention

875
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Anything

876
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
By the way I meant

877
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
Video clips

878
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
So you got doing the Lesser pull the yard

879
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Thanks

880
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Shut off

881
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
What's the password

882
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
The

883
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Flash

884
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
VA board

885
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
I'm sorry what

886
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,623
Did they do that

887
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,487
We're just going to stop even doing trials or studies on things

888
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Okay

889
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
CDC rainsong EPA

890
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,151
Everyone okay

891
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
So

892
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Baskin-Robbins

893
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
And Wendy's

894
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
At A&W

895
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
And everybody have decided to open One restaurant

896
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,487
EPA will be running out of it

897
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,143
This was DC is there

898
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Stop

899
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,103
Wouldn't make some mistakes if you're just making s*** up all the time

900
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,687
You're going to make some frog wine

901
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
Who is drowning

902
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
And he is flailing

903
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
Pasta

904
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
CA EDD

905
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,303
Noble experiment or trial is nothing

906
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
Did you want a new pill

907
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,495
Well it will give it to you but what about a rock

908
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
This wasn't on the national news

909
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,615
Is this was just an article that Alex Kim the headline of

910
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
That was published in the epoch times

911
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:12,063
The full headline is World Health Organization behind FDA scheme to skip all future clinical trials

912
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
For covid-19

913
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:19,999
It was a lot of bulshit that doesn't even live up to that leaving aside the insane nonsense Alex's reporting

914
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,607
He's looping in the EPA apparently which is reme Court decision right

915
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
I don't think so

916
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,007
Yeah

917
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
What's at the root of this is that there was an F

918
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
Ta meeting where one of the topics of conversation was the idea of being able to

919
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
The create an adjust

920
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,479
Will covid vaccine the could be flexible

921
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
Do the changing distributions of differ

922
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Variance

923
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,111
Auto coverage of this is just completely meaningless

924
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
It has no relation

925
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
To the actual real word

926
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Wild

927
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,303
Trump running

928
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
EPA FDA

929
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
It's just saying all those letters

930
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,495
Is in a row is very very funny

931
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,823
You know what I'm telling you right now I bet if we go into his office

932
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,895
A lot of those fossils and shells that he found

933
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
Rocks man almost

934
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
Got2b 2 like the his story was about like

935
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Not find a

936
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Watch

937
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
Yeah that is that is interesting stories about hurting

938
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,255
Is back that's what's important

939
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,559
Defy why he would climb out there

940
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,655
Yeah but I do believe that he didn't find a Shell today

941
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
Let's see that's believable

942
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,007
So look Alex's pumps

943
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Obviously

944
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
He needs to spread the bug around

945
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,175
He's got it he's got to make other

946
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,503
People really excited about this whole Trump thing

947
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
I'll make this decision

948
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
Owen Shroyer what to do

949
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
He doesn't rain instead

950
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
But at once a year

951
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Call Owen

952
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
Boxing or lifting weights

953
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,711
Obviously I was going to be covering

954
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015
2024 announcement coming on Monday

955
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:26,207
Whole Food hours

956
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Alright

957
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,607
Cool. You know he's so he's so excited because the campaign part is

958
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
Fun

959
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
The campaign parties

960
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
EPPICard

961
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Bulshit

962
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
Nobody means any of it

963
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,383
You can argue about it well if you can argue about Trump promising something that you know he's not even going to

964
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,711
Try to respond rallies everybody gets excited

965
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,807
Excited it's great there is actually to spoil a call from later

966
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Someone calls in and says

967
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,159
I'll just go ahead

968
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Because I think this person makes

969
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
A really good point

970
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,839
North Carolina let's talk to Neil Neil thanks for calling ahead

971
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,679
Call Alexei first of all

972
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
How to say that no one

973
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Would like to

974
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,311
See Trump declare faster than the media

975
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Because

976
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Was it will boot

977
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Who's their ratings

978
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Skyrocket

979
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,479
100

980
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
The media includes Al

981
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,855
Like Alex is excited for this because there's

982
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
A prospect

983
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,695
How much more he's going to

984
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
To be able to

985
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Drawing attention wise

986
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
The pie-in-the-sky

987
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Element of this to that is like wow

988
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Trump runs

989
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
They probably can't prosecute

990
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,823
If that gets derailed I might be unless hot water

991
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Yelp

992
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
So I think I think there's a lot of different

993
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Aspects to this but

994
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
I think you're right

995
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
The campaign aspect is much more

996
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
Funland Elijah

997
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Just later

998
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,951
Oh yeah yeah everybody just wants to get attention so you say

999
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,255
Flamboyant nonsense

1000
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,071
Get it all out there and then if you actually do get elect

1001
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
You just say that you didn't mean any of it

1002
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,727
Here is a description little bit longer but it's where Alex

1003
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Terminix

1004
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Bswift like

1005
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:22,687
I like it

1006
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:27,551
Anomic news that'll affect everyone of us was bigger than anything we've ever experienced

1007
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
I mean I shutter

1008
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
In Anger at myself

1009
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,607
I'm not running around 24/7 myself

1010
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Getting prepared

1011
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
My pleasure smart but it's also week

1012
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
What

1013
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
Because it thinks about itself and says you get ready to protect yourself

1014
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
What button

1015
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
I don't use a spirit

1016
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Lightyear

1017
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
And fight the tyranny

1018
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,207
Then all the horrible stuff will happen and then some

1019
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
That's an interesting thing to say

1020
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
Experience

1021
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,911
The vast majority of your time

1022
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
Starting to stop evil

1023
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Fighting

1024
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
And then sometime being prepared

1025
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
But we better the season now

1026
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
It's not about stopping at anymore

1027
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
It's about getting

1028
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
Prepared

1029
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:41,535
Rick's announces new world Reserve currency is American to Mexican Onyx suicide

1030
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,143
Are all amazing I mean

1031
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,007
I'm in a good mood but I'm not mad

1032
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Is Grand Slam

1033
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Muhammad Ali

1034
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Favoritism

1035
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Infowars.com

1036
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,695
10 phone calls ahead of Alex.

1037
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,279
I'll get to you I want you

1038
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,095
Alex

1039
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Please don't look 20 up

1040
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Cuz we do that

1041
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Men

1042
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
No

1043
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
But

1044
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
Phone calls on what do you think

1045
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
On this

1046
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
Wednesday June 29th broadcast

1047
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,559
Someone to talk to Donald John Trump

1048
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,423
Is right now to an hour

1049
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
On July 4th

1050
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
In 5 days

1051
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
It's incest

1052
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:04,223
If I said anything in that clip anywhere near a hospital they would not let me leave the house

1053
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
I think it's pretty

1054
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
For the course for him I'm basically just making excuses not to do your job.

1055
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Play the gris-gris report at with people about

1056
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Runnings

1057
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,935
Total I don't want to see if the audience is into it or not

1058
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,239
Frankly if they might not be true

1059
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
Weirdo for a bit

1060
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
I'm he's just he's so emotionally abusive

1061
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Like you can feel

1062
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
That clip

1063
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Being like

1064
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Everyday

1065
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Just called man

1066
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,623
When he's in a really good mood he's so nice and he's complementary but when he's in a bad mood

1067
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,207
He's just so mean to him so apparently unfortunately

1068
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,279
The entire work staff is now devoted towards

1069
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
In a good mood and that doesn't go well

1070
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
No

1071
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Never any good at

1072
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
Alex seems to be like like I mentioned obviously the incentive of

1073
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,199
The ratings and what have you they would come from Trump running the course

1074
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
There is also that legalized

1075
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Give me the toll-free number

1076
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
The first

1077
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,535
You're 60 seconds on what do you think of the exclusive

1078
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,007
Ramification

1079
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Wild

1080
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
What are the

1081
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,919
Dinos

1082
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
If he announces his run

1083
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,343
Historically that someone

1084
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,391
Prominent

1085
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
This is so big

1086
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
That sounds like Alex saying like if

1087
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
If you run

1088
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,631
He won't be punished for the crimes that you did that's 100% that

1089
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:04,031
Cool man so weirded out by this I'm so weirded out by this and it's not because

1090
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,591
Anything but I just really have always

1091
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Spelt

1092
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,943
That if you lose a coup then you die

1093
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
I just always thought that's how it's supposed to I'm not saying that it's supposed to work that matches to the workbooks

1094
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,927
Has seemed like that's the projector

1095
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
You win or you die and it's not like a

1096
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:27,071
Did not even personally just the way the system works

1097
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,655
Moore historical times to it seems like that was what

1098
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
The coup attempt or would have want

1099
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
It's kind of humiliating cute

1100
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
Anything cool buddy

1101
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:47,295
That's how do you know the Japanese do it right now to is this school that is

1102
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Pretended like it's

1103
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Sinatra

1104
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,487
Coo and there'll opening didn't go well

1105
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,583
Well I'll be there trying to retool their their f****** service staff

1106
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,911
Another going to try again

1107
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
That's as we all do

1108
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
Yeah and then they lost

1109
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,543
The counter coup so they have to

1110
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
To do the

1111
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Counter counter

1112
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
Counter

1113
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Counter

1114
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Haha

1115
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
Fresh Wok

1116
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:21,343
Anyway it seems like Alex is also excited like I mentioned earlier that this is just going to freak out though

1117
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,111
A f****** live

1118
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
Just a freak these people out

1119
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
Brought him into the ground

1120
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
Y'all go see Santa

1121
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,839
All planets align

1122
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,143
Trump right now is planning

1123
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,495
His second run for president United States

1124
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,567
Only ever ran for office and became president first time

1125
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
What

1126
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
Abraham Lincoln

1127
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
That's not true

1128
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,063
Just any just for the site like

1129
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,903
Trump did try to run for president before

1130
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,303
Also I think Alex is saying the Trump wants to announce his run because he's jealous of the attention that the scientist

1131
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
It really does

1132
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
That would be a motivation

1133
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
Heady narcissism 100%

1134
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
104

1135
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Look

1136
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,687
Whether Trump announces on Monday or if there is tact

1137
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,759
Medical flexibility

1138
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
That is always true wishy-washy

1139
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
Tactical flexibility

1140
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,207
There's one thing no matter what always true

1141
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:46,847
Can the holy spirit in Gaston effusion

1142
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
20 hours a day

1143
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Hours a day

1144
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
20 hours a day

1145
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
8:15

1146
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
Not a chance

1147
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,535
I want to get to you and I got to get through us to get to you

1148
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,911
Do you want to get to your family that I can get through you first

1149
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:17,823
The one thing I want to do is beat the Satanist off 1% I am

1150
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
Mulan

1151
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
I want you to go now

1152
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:31,647
Infowarsstore.com

1153
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
Build our community

1154
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,887
Is the best prices ever

1155
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
That is

1156
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:47,775
That is the rename this the Trump announces his candidacy

1157
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,079
Like when he's in a good mood

1158
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
He selling s*** like a

1159
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,407
Televangelist

1160
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,943
The day is coming

1161
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:02,879
Close and you will need to send a good mood to his likability to

1162
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,695
We've emotion into salesmanship is like

1163
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,487
It's a little more on point

1164
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,815
Also man like this dude doesn't do

1165
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
15 hours

1166
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Of preparation

1167
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
He doesn't do 15 minutes

1168
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
Separation

1169
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,239
Cold read headline

1170
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
He said NATO cities

1171
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,871
Adnan said whatever that means

1172
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,407
20 hours of work yeah

1173
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,479
Come on man if you would have read the article within that

1174
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
20 hours

1175
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,879
And maybe if you're doing 20 hours of work maybe spend an hour

1176
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Focus

1177
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,463
On reading one article you can do that

1178
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
Mmu do what you have

1179
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
Rouladen

1180
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,071
So maybe spend an hour

1181
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,863
Clearing your head

1182
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
Before you get on air

1183
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,447
Good luck breathe a little bit relax

1184
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,495
Do some guided meditation end up

1185
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:55,103
Screaming at the crew or probably about I'd be a better use of time Shirley

1186
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
So now we're going to take a call

1187
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
Because Alex doesn't want to work

1188
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
10 calls

1189
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
No work

1190
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,551
15 axle

1191
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
I mean

1192
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
There's only one thing you want

1193
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,183
What's the talk about

1194
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Global Link

1195
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,487
Exclusive news

1196
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:15,583
Only call and let somebody love you and you have open free-for-all like yesterday

1197
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
2 hours was amazing I love

1198
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,911
Free for all of the wild card

1199
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,447
Today's on Wildcard

1200
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,983
Day is one topic

1201
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
And one topic only

1202
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,311
Is Trump

1203
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,783
Monday

1204
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,319
But as of now

1205
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:41,439
Truck is intending to announce on Monday global eggsclusive

1206
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
Tomorrow's news today

1207
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
I would say that

1208
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,583
This is sad but also

1209
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Response from the audience

1210
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Barely mix

1211
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,727
Are there some people who are like really excited about Trump

1212
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
And then there's some people who like

1213
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,311
He's really old

1214
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,359
We need somebody younger

1215
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
Great

1216
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
He did some good thing shaft

1217
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,455
There's some people who are just like

1218
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
Yeah he

1219
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,783
Got the vaccines rolled out like

1220
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,831
Like what do you want like we need somebody

1221
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:14,719
Not him sure we've done this already so I don't know like it gauging

1222
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
From the calls themselves

1223
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,047
I don't know what the temp

1224
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,327
Mature is with his audience

1225
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,631
Using that as a represented

1226
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
Example I'm not sure if they're like

1227
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,263
Pumped for Trump 2024

1228
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,335
I think it would be wise for Alex to be more in the sand

1229
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
You think so

1230
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
I think everybody fall in line

1231
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
And I very much doubt DeSantis

1232
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:42,623
Falling line regardless of which way

1233
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,903
DeSantis he's going to

1234
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Look

1235
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
I just

1236
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,023
Find him to be callow

1237
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
And it's going to be revealed whenever trumped

1238
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,143
Decides to make him feel like a tiny little girl

1239
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:57,471
In the the primaries

1240
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
He

1241
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,543
Handled Marco Rubio

1242
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:05,151
I'm like yeah I guess I I don't I don't know if the scientist

1243
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Could fight that

1244
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,991
I do I do I feel like you need Jesse vu

1245
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,087
Ventura to go up against a professional writers

1246
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,671
Professional professional

1247
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Right angle

1248
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Yeah

1249
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,767
It's just going to he's going to wilt

1250
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
He's going to wilt

1251
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
He's going to get made

1252
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,375
Fun of and he's going to get all prickly need to be like

1253
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,447
No I'm not and everybody's like oh you're a child

1254
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
Your callow child

1255
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Maybe

1256
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
But

1257
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
I also think

1258
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,919
Probably there'll be more insta

1259
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
The two channels

1260
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
Support behind

1261
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,783
DeSantis then Trump because I think the

1262
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,855
Probably rightfully so

1263
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,695
Most of the GOP could realize a we can get everything that we

1264
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
Could get with strawberry Leaf without a lot of this headache

1265
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
With the

1266
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,679
Future

1267
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
And that makes sense

1268
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
Unless you think

1269
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
Perhaps

1270
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
Apps that are unintended

1271
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:09,663
Sequences to making your entire base insane. That is a problem

1272
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
And that is the power velen

1273
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,087
Forest the night make it very difficult to predict

1274
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Sue McMahon

1275
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,439
Alex wants to cover the news

1276
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
Because Rodger Stone

1277
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
He told me you don't

1278
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
And now

1279
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
JonTron

1280
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
That's a huge piece

1281
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,599
He had to take calls and not do any of the news

1282
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:57,023
Can't do it's Rodger talk some s*** Rodger said something so the entire three hours of show that I admit

1283
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,303
Tequila sleep land

1284
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,143
Add 100% for sure

1285
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:07,263
Poem Every Vic minute-by-minute outline to make sure that I stayed on topic

1286
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
Just can't do it every every break

1287
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,615
You know every segment

1288
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
Is like building

1289
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
Everything is one topic is another topic

1290
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
D at the top of the hour

1291
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:26,975
We're bringing them all together

1292
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:31,583
Rodger

1293
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,983
Years away deprived of this hard-hitting news

1294
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,823
Oh my God it's can't cancel all of his

1295
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,359
Appointment

1296
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,895
That's the other guy named Alex Stein

1297
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
I don't know if you know who this guy is

1298
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,063
Is that dude who made some videos of himself like rapping

1299
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
Sing a council meeting

1300
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Things and stuff

1301
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,927
They went around on social media

1302
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
No

1303
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,559
Yeah I'm not to target audience for engaging with those

1304
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,399
Remy guy who hit things with hammer territory

1305
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
Play Usher more malevolent

1306
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,311
Yeah I had no incredibly cerebral comedy or farts

1307
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,615
No in-between no middle ground

1308
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
One or the other guy sucks

1309
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,735
But Alex wants to know where he's at on

1310
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,903
Sadly people are dumb Alex you know this so this is my only in our thing that worries me about Trump is there so much bad

1311
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,559
Trumpet DeSantis doesn't have not I love Trump I like eventual Trump As Trump runs I'm buying from

1312
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
But these people

1313
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
Are so dumb

1314
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,239
Use fake evidence against Trump that they don't have onto Sanchez

1315
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,103
Do it for me I mean I'm willing to bet whoever is going to going to be on the conservative side

1316
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
But I almost think Trump will be more powerful

1317
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
Being a kingmaker

1318
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:55,039
Buy running for president first night now

1319
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
On time

1320
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Alex

1321
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,791
Right now Primetime Alex time we never committed a crime Ron DeSantis

1322
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:12,191
100% not possible to find dirt on that guy so this dude Alex Stein came into prominence like I said by filling in

1323
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,239
Filming himself doing silly raps

1324
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
City council meeting

1325
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:21,919
My sense of the whole thing is that people saw the videos and thought they were really embarrassing which led to them sharing them

1326
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
They're making

1327
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
Fun of him and now he's got it cuz they went viral and he had a lot to him

1328
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
I think that he must be doing some

1329
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,927
Smart right

1330
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,719
Triggering people exactly

1331
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,791
Desperate loser I guess did some comedy but it's

1332
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:42,655
Funny and then tried to break through by being on a reality TV show called The Glass House

1333
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,471
Back in 2012 but none of it really amounted

1334
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Happy in the era of covid Hebrew

1335
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,871
Pretty astutely realize the people were making videos of themselves

1336
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
The council meeting

1337
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
And they were going viral

1338
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
Pretty easily

1339
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,039
It's a free microphone where officials have to let you speak

1340
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,599
So he came in and acted like a complete stew

1341
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
The juxtaposition of it

1342
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,927
Was really a luring bait

1343
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
For people on social media idiot who they can't

1344
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
Stop from doing something

1345
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:14,655
Idiotic bright and then you have the stuffy councilmembers sitting there being all official

1346
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:21,823
So I poked around on this guy a little bit and honestly I don't see anything other than an a****** who is like will do

1347
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
Just do anything for attention

1348
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
And it seems like he would agree with me

1349
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
As a Dallas magazine article quotes in

1350
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
From his time on that TV show The Glass House

1351
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
Quote America should I turn

1352
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:36,159
The most epic villain in the history of reality TV

1353
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,999
Nobody in this house is going to do what I do because I've got no shame

1354
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,911
That's true he seems pretty stupid too considering if these evil globalist can just make up stuff about Trump

1355
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,751
Chances in 2024 why can't they make up stuff about the Santa

1356
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
I mean

1357
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
I mean these things is no answer like if it doesn't matter who you are

1358
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
Just make things up

1359
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
About you

1360
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
Do you know how we know that

1361
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:07,391
For sure because the right calls everyone a pedophile

1362
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,047
I think went through its time is actually trying to say is that Trump has done a bunch of horrible ship that the media can remind

1363
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
People love

1364
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,375
Whereas most people don't really know all that much about Rhonda

1365
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
There's a there's more of

1366
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,543
Familiar with him where you'd be able to have a bunch

1367
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,823
Step stick where is

1368
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
With trumpets

1369
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Just like

1370
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,895
A laundry list of

1371
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Remember that

1372
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,855
Wow I really can't I can't believe that I don't remember that

1373
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Every now and again

1374
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
Suddenly I'll remember the Four Seasons in be like

1375
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Fine

1376
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,279
Fascism that's what we learned

1377
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
That's what we learned

1378
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,399
Weird it where is DeSantis

1379
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Notsobot

1380
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
So I really don't like

1381
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,239
Alex Stein

1382
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031
I think you sucks

1383
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,847
If I was on a reality show if I was down on The Glass House

1384
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
The problem I would have been

1385
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,199
Kicked off of media Coronavirus

1386
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,247
Camera operator all the time be like

1387
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Check messages

1388
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,111
Can get it

1389
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,159
Get it now it's really funny

1390
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Get it

1391
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Naruto

1392
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
Cuz that thing

1393
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
You got it

1394
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:21,631
My grandpa used to say people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones

1395
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Better

1396
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,031
There might have been another layer on that show but I'm not sure if there was I think it might

1397
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:32,639
The reason I'm confused is because on its own is not a joke

1398
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
That's what he said

1399
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
Anyway

1400
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
This guy sucks yeah I really don't like him

1401
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Use the word

1402
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:45,439
Syndrome is a real thing

1403
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,767
That is the biggest crock of Lies I've ever heard in my entire

1404
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,559
Higher life

1405
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:55,423
And if you look at the schedule

1406
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,287
Exactly

1407
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
So does not caused by vaccine

1408
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,247
Also something don't send room is a code word that people like Stein or trying to associate with people who have died

1409
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,783
Who's also got nekoba

1410
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,855
It's basically an attempt to create branding

1411
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
For that right

1412
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:20,511
The problem is it's unto death Sunbelt death syndrome is a real thing and it long predates covid

1413
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
There's an umbrella of things that encompass

1414
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,679
But it's generally people died unexpectedly in their sleep

1415
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,751
In some cases the cause has never determined

1416
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,079
I thought to be due to inherit at the heart.

1417
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,871
Disease that have gone unnoticed

1418
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,175
You can probably literature on this going back

1419
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:44,831
Alright this is a propaganda branding exercise for Stein so he doesn't particularly care that

1420
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,879
His actions are treating real people's deaths

1421
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
As the butt of his joke

1422
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,207
I'm being like oh you want us to think

1423
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,023
This is a real a real thing

1424
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,303
Is a real thing

1425
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Rick

1426
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,399
Anyway here's what I'm saying

1427
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,727
I really don't like this guy

1428
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,519
Partially because of his Paula

1429
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
I think they suck

1430
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,359
And then partially because his whole game

1431
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
Is sober

1432
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,919
Boring and transparent

1433
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,223
Like it really is just about

1434
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
Trying to get attention

1435
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:18,623
Yeah and the way the people go about pushing back against that often is counterproductive

1436
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
Because it gives him more at

1437
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
And I think that

1438
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
You know I think it's cheap

1439
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
It's a trap

1440
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,815
Keep playing the game that's a trap

1441
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
I don't respect that at all

1442
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
Why

1443
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Does the kid

1444
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
Eat the worm

1445
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,287
He doesn't need it for the $0.05 or whatever he needs it to make the

1446
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
People laugh and give him attention

1447
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,359
And then they laugh and give him attention

1448
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,407
And then he does it again because he knows

1449
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
Inglot get laughs and attend

1450
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
That's what it is

1451
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
And he's just never change

1452
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
From that five-year-old

1453
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,855
It's the worm it is very well maybe

1454
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:55,743
But whatever the case he's using it for evil and I got no time for it disrespect

1455
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Quite a bit

1456
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,047
Agree

1457
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:01,375
Yes a correlation doesn't mean causation but anybody with half

1458
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Realized

1459
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,191
That's a lie that's a bold-faced lie

1460
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,519
Wow what correlation does mean causation apparently

1461
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,359
Wow I mean those few stupider things you

1462
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
Pretzel why

1463
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,687
Not that's wrong

1464
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
That's a lie

1465
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,295
Like we've known for centuries

1466
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
Correlation does equal causation

1467
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,671
The greatest trick that Archimedes everbowl

1468
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,767
Website

1469
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Like

1470
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
Make graphs of

1471
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Things that are unrelated

1472
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
Run parallel to each other

1473
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,263
There's a Litany of examples of things that are

1474
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,799
But don't.

1475
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,103
And if you sit there and get high

1476
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
Stare at them and be like

1477
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,943
Is there a connection or mustard

1478
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,479
Alex

1479
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:53,087
You know that there is absolutely

1480
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Cells in a conversation

1481
01:11:55,391 --> 01:12:01,023
Information about apparently they approve the Trump is running

1482
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,815
And he's going to announce

1483
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Here's what we know he's running

1484
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,959
Just announced today six more women say that he raped them at 11

1485
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,967
Yeah I'm in a situation that's the problem is people are able to decipher

1486
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,527
We can say that the

1487
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
Sadly Alex you know this

1488
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
The mass population are all dumb down on antidepressants have no idea last ride up and down the road.

1489
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
About their bills are worried about the inflation

1490
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
I don't know what

1491
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
6 women

1492
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
Stories talking about

1493
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
I don't think that's a real story

1494
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,935
I think I was just making that up

1495
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,751
In order to pretend

1496
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,567
The Trump is being subject to

1497
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
Brighton attacks

1498
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,919
Right which would make his argument about the July 4th announcement

1499
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
More plausible to his

1500
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
Conspiracy

1501
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Mind riddle

1502
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Right

1503
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
Right I think that's

1504
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
What's going on

1505
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
I don't know what the story is

1506
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,255
About 6

1507
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
Nope

1508
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,303
I don't think that

1509
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
He can make up

1510
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Just because

1511
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:08,863
I'm in fukkit

1512
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,679
Sure

1513
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:18,335
Sure it's plausible very possible possible that the globalist would make that up in order

1514
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,895
Besmirch his good name

1515
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
What is really stupid

1516
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Because

1517
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
Clearly

1518
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
In effect

1519
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
Previously

1520
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,367
Made up in 6

1521
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,903
Additional doesn't

1522
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
If that's

1523
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,975
You're if the globalist plan is like okay

1524
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Well we need

1525
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
6

1526
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,583
Every breed perforate

1527
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
But we need

1528
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
Sure

1529
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,703
I don't know

1530
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,799
Talks a little bit here about the inspiration for his work

1531
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:53,151
I'm killing your mother in the hospital deny her treatment with push you over the edge

1532
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:05,951
I appreciate that and I just showed a good friend of mine is Gavin McInnes and I was on his show and he actually said it you're not in jail

1533
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:11,071
She said your mom dying was the best thing that ever happened to you before so I was the worst thing I would trade all the you know

1534
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,679
The Hanson Clayton followers and all the 70 guy for my mom in a second

1535
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Cobra back

1536
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:22,847
But I will say this is a dangerous man because I have nothing to lose and that is the most dangerous person is a person

1537
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:28,223
A hundred percent I have no choice but to fight back in this culture War

1538
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:33,087
Yeah right so yeah the mom died of covid-19 in October 2021

1539
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,391
The doctors didn't deny her care but

1540
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,487
But he's decided that because the hospital allegedly gave her a severe they kill

1541
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,279
His dad rap

1542
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607
Spoke to Dallas magazine and said quote it traumatized him

1543
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
I totally broke him down

1544
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,959
And he's reacting to that dramatization

1545
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
He's not the same person after that

1546
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:54,079
He says he is but he's not the same guy right now

1547
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,151
This article by Jonathan topping is

1548
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Fascinator

1549
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:03,807
I recommend people check it out they want to dive into a very sad story about

1550
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,599
And wear some of that come

1551
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:10,719
Also if you're friends with Gavin McGinnis in 2022 that speaks volumes

1552
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
About you

1553
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
You suck

1554
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,607
If you're friends with Gavin McGinnis you deserve to have Gavin McGinnis

1555
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,655
Just tell you that your mom dying is a good thing

1556
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
That's you get it

1557
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
You earned it

1558
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
You deserve it

1559
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,335
I think that there are you know

1560
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:32,991
Comedy friend sometimes there's a lot of chop busting and trash I feel like that's a little much

1561
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:36,319
Maybe your mom dying is the best thing that ever happened to you

1562
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:40,415
When it's been less than a year particularly like

1563
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
F***** up

1564
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,279
Now these the only time that's acceptable is

1565
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,815
At the funeral

1566
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,887
Because the added level of immediacy makes the

1567
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
The funny part

1568
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,935
You know like it's so naughty

1569
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
It's not supposed to happen

1570
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
You know that kind of thing

1571
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
But if you're like

1572
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Two days after

1573
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,639
Don't make that f****** joke to me and especially when the joke is that like

1574
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,919
Because your mom died

1575
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
You've created this

1576
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,575
Attention to where you're monetizing bothering

1577
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,879
People you literally have

1578
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,439
Supervillain origin story

1579
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
Which is

1580
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,999
Maybe not true

1581
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Anyway

1582
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Look this dude he loves

1583
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,959
Confrontation because that is exciting content that he can post

1584
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,567
Calm conversation with somebody

1585
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,151
Boring video trailer

1586
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,623
On the 13th

1587
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:49,023
And I'm going to be at Capitol Hill I'm going to go confront all these politicians I'm going to Elon Omar you married your brother I'm going to say I'll see you're my favorite

1588
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Big booty latina

1589
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:54,399
I'm going to get in all these politicians face because that's what I like to do is I like confrontation

1590
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,959
It seems like maybe confrontation for him is just

1591
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
Being racist

1592
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
Yeah I mean

1593
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,055
Harassment

1594
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Assault

1595
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
Sure

1596
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,175
Booking job Tim pool

1597
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
I just

1598
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,991
Feel like

1599
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,271
If you

1600
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:14,111
Somebody who loves confrontation

1601
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,695
Choose this word but it's my brand

1602
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,303
Use at work you're literally branding that's what you're at

1603
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
Kind of

1604
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,935
You're telling people what your branches has the brand

1605
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
Yeah

1606
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,591
Confrontation is yelling hey ilhan Omar you married your brother

1607
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,383
And harassing

1608
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,431
Sexually harassing

1609
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,247
AOC

1610
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,575
That's not meaningful confrontation

1611
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
There is

1612
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
Meaningful confrontation like

1613
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,207
No some of Michael Moore's early documentaries here

1614
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,023
Meaning for confrontation

1615
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,655
Congress

1616
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,215
How about trivial nonsense and lies

1617
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
No go fuc

1618
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,311
Yourself man in front of

01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Tanks

1620
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,615
That's good confrontation

1621
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
ATS it's hard to be

1622
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
Beat that confrontation

1623
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Ross

1624
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
Nixon not

1625
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Here's a here's what I would say if

1626
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,879
If the dude in Tiananmen Square had instead been like

1627
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:25,279
Hey tank you got a fat ass and then ran away that would not be meaningful a couple thousand dollars

1628
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,887
On YouTube

1629
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
Totally yeah

1630
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:37,567
And I'm doing it all for you because I want to protect freedoms

1631
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Right

1632
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,431
So I regret to inform you he's also

1633
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Yeah well that's

1634
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:54,975
How do you transfer the owner making that decision

1635
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:00,095
And that's a problem

1636
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,935
Is it to transfer a big meme let's

1637
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
I'm going around online for a long time

1638
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
Email

1639
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
That was enough

1640
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,383
The Dome now that's not an original thought that is just delegitimizing

1641
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,407
Transit

1642
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:16,479
I would say so far we have not heard any rich

1643
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
No thoughts

1644
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
Gives just

1645
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
An attention

1646
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,463
Any looks at other people's ways of getting attention in any does

1647
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,303
Because he's already got an extra boost from the very early stuff he gets

1648
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,095
To consolidate is its fan base

1649
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Skip

1650
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
It's a it's an economy now

1651
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,495
So we can do really insane collar

1652
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,287
Okay now I'm in

1653
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,847
Spine is still there

1654
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
And this guy calls in

1655
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
And like for the 1st

1656
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,551
Half of this call I did not know what was going on and then it gets real good

1657
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,087
So might be down for that

1658
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
Brad Stine

1659
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,239
Just a couple little things

1660
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
We got to just throw that out of our brain

1661
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,592
I just get ready for the roller coaster ride

1662
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,920
Cuz he's coming back and they're going to form the new American

1663
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,968
That's right they got hurt on the Patriots

1664
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:21,760
In Florida

1665
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
Golden Ox

1666
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,624
South America form up with

1667
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
You're on fire but he can show me Trump

1668
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,840
Crash

1669
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,912
Poison shot

1670
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,216
The second thing you said where's the proof

1671
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
He's almost whitelock

1672
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
Would not confirm that he was at the island

1673
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
Well it's supposedly there's some story that he wasn't on the actual Lolita Express that he was on the plane with Jeffrey Epstein One X

1674
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
It doesn't matter

1675
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,424
Discolor I don't know what was going on there I could

1676
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,312
Walking with them right or if he is excited about Trump right

1677
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,896
Seems like it's impossible that it's a pro-trump call

1678
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:26,016
Because he did not cease from South America, and join them in Texas

1679
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,416
Are you saying I we got to give him some slack he was on the Lolita Express right doesn't seem like a sincere point to be making

1680
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:38,816
Doesn't seem insane because he's able to moderate and be like six times

1681
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
He's not here

1682
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,656
Keep going with that manic energy nope it was

1683
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:47,520
Performative in some way that makes me think that it's someone f****** with Alex

1684
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,616
I think so but also drop absolutely was on those flight locks

1685
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,664
What does the name

1686
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,712
No way that Alex doesn't know that

1687
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Elaine Maxwell

1688
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:02,880
Trial it came out that he'd actually flown on Epstein's jet at least six times more than it been previously known

1689
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,160
He's flown on Epstein's

1690
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:07,232
A bunch of times at so I guess Alex

1691
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792
To decide whether he's going to pretend that isn't real

1692
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,376
He's going to make an excuse for it and pretend baby it's not a big deal

1693
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
Or

1694
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,192
He's going to follow through and abandon

1695
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,520
I'm going to guess he's going to go into pretend plan

1696
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
I'm going to go with number one

1697
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,920
Just amazing principal Alex Stein is showing there

1698
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:31,552
Who cares I mean there's literally make our entire brand this

1699
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,088
Pedophile panic

1700
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,928
You called everybody thought of playing with

1701
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,000
The arch pedophiles at we

1702
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,584
Okay fine so he was on a plane with a pedophile

1703
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,704
And knowing what we know about Trump and everybody who's gone to Epstein Island

1704
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,056
12 comments Trump has made about Epstein in the past

1705
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Yep

1706
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:59,200
Come on guys she's described the man said of Epstein he likes them young

1707
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,320
Where is very excited

1708
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,344
2024

1709
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,744
And just because this caller things have hit a little bit of a little bit of disco

1710
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,072
Open now because of this

1711
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
A little bit

1712
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,680
Not like a really terrible Tales

1713
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,008
Basketball because the show's almost over because

1714
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:23,776
He can just

1715
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
Bucking tonight

1716
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,456
Halloween Express according to flight logs

1717
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:35,040
The Democrats of confusion grab the wheel

1718
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,112
Of the Secret Service limo and it's not true

1719
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,672
Just like I have a black tongue it's not true

1720
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Talk to Trump

1721
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,744
On January 5th

1722
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,792
Had talked to come for over a year

1723
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
Trump definitely was

1724
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,984
Well reported

1725
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
No it wasn't like

1726
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
Crump

1727
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:02,432
And then the sea was like a little bit right

1728
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,736
Reporting from licking Miami Herald

1729
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,272
Do you know that that's that

1730
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,064
It's well-known and Elaine Maxwell

1731
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,136
And also you know who else was on

1732
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
Bill Gates

1733
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
Sure but also you know who else

1734
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
This list

1735
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,144
Yeah I was going to say

1736
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,936
For no reason at all

1737
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
Robert Kennedy Jr

1738
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,800
Roberto Junior

1739
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,848
And like I said I bring this up for no reason

1740
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,736
I had it I was doing a charity event for a children's health defense to charity Robert Kennedy run

1741
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:43,136
And it's charity basically a performance for a Robert Kennedy

1742
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:49,536
Fundraiser for his fax chair Robert Kennedy Jr was on the Lolita Express

1743
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,584
And he was allowed to have

1744
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
The children's charity

1745
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,448
Saving the children from vaccines

1746
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,240
I'm not actually sure how much

1747
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
It is a children's charity

1748
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,312
It's for like anti-vax

1749
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
Experiment

1750
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:07,712
To stop children from having to have that scene

1751
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,272
Are we good

1752
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:14,112
I think it from what I understand I think he might have only been on the plane w

1753
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,416
What I want

1754
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,976
Yeah but still

1755
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,512
Anyway look

1756
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:25,120
I only killed one guy but no

1757
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
Once too many

1758
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
So Alex

1759
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,544
Alright now listen

1760
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
July 4th

1761
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:40,992
We're really excited about this

1762
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,832
He can't do that

1763
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
Because he was

1764
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
Except for one time

1765
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
Putlocker

1766
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
It's not a big deal

1767
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Trump fluent

1768
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,816
Express which means he fled the island

1769
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:58,400
The flight logs they've all been checked on that airplane

1770
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,216
97

1771
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
From Newark

1772
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
Into Palm Beach

1773
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
And that's the only time

1774
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
20

1775
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
Donald Trump

1776
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
What is playing

1777
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,064
Palm Beach

1778
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:21,696
Or any of this she says he hasn't

1779
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:27,584
Actually one of the flight

1780
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,984
The Trump took with commercial flight to he was on a plane

1781
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,312
With Epstein

1782
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:43,712
Epstein was it sabse was in the middle of me plus

1783
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
I can't believe you're on the same flight why are we both flying commercial right now on some level that Alex is

1784
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
I think that there is one

1785
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
Answer this because

1786
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,488
Is an erosion of his

1787
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,512
His

1788
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
Previous

1789
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,816
The point that he was making

1790
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,376
Look a little deeper Alex

1791
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,912
That if you can find some of the

1792
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,704
Very clear and

1793
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,264
The obvious things that have been reported

1794
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
So you pretend to Arch real

1795
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Dumbass

1796
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,616
Yep anyway

1797
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
Trump

1798
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
On Monday tomorrow right

1799
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,600
Tomorrow

1800
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
Tactical

1801
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,720
Flexible news is today that's what it is

1802
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
I mean look

1803
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,328
If it doesn't if he doesn't up announcing

1804
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,888
Whatever I don't I wait still not news

1805
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Yeah

1806
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,728
Man I wonder

1807
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,776
I think it would be

1808
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,056
Astounding if he

1809
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,616
It'll be amazing because Alex had asked

1810
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
Cuz like

1811
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
How

1812
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Chaotic that

1813
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Like I said

1814
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Disrespectful

1815
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
Absolutely

1816
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Care like

1817
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
About

1818
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,160
Beautifying the country of that much

1819
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Yeah

1820
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
I mean

1821
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
Even if you take the

1822
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
The country out of it

1823
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
Barbecuing

1824
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
Totally

1825
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Firework

1826
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
Don't make

1827
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:11,008
Fireworks about yourself wearing a better wedding dress

1828
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
Good good what good way to put it

1829
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,432
So we will see on Monday what happened

1830
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,808
Also Alex Stein sucks don't pay him any attention oh

1831
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,136
Back

1832
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,792
Until then

1833
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,120
