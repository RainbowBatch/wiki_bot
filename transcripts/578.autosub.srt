1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
The Beverages and talk a little talk about Selena

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
So I thought I saw it was all my fault I was there in the beginning

7
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
I love a two-button

8
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Don't do it again don't find that magic one more time that's always go back to that well

9
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Did I have a quick question

10
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
What's your bright spot

11
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,584
Today by breakbot today is an email that I got from the WWE

12
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:45,472
Ask gifts not the wrestling guy the worldwide life

13
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,336
Maybe Sue's shoes

14
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
Susie in order of the

15
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
The altar of Celine

16
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
And inspired by the elephant that was adopted

17
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Celine's child elephant has gotten

18
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm liking this now we do

19
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
How inexplicably adopted

20
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,568
Delete a message I feel like the elephant needed a sibling

21
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
It's pronounced kwakho by the way

22
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Thank you so much that's so sweet I really really appreciate it

23
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
Absolutely I think that's

24
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Just exciting and really cool yeah it's really cool that's your bright spot

25
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Has a new album out there

26
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
Tacular really really good

27
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
He's on a streak of like

28
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Four straight albums that have been spectacular like you can go back to big

29
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
Big Fish Theory and that's still

30
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Second grade

31
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
It's it's really really good

32
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Nice really good let's check it out cuz this is the second time someone has recommended

33
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
You know that's kind of like alright fine I apparently need to be conversant in this

34
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
And a plus-one it you can't just have meat

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Yeah I got you

36
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,632
So Jordan today we have an episode to go over and I'm going to give a little bit of a warning up top I guess

37
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
I already told you this because you need to emotionally prepare

38
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,920
Episode that is about a video that Nick Fuentes posted on his website banned. Video

39
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
I totally understand that there are some people who hate

40
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
The sound of his voice and can't handle it

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
And I fully respect

42
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
If you are that sort of prisoner I promise

43
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
We're not going to become an acquaintance

44
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
But

45
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
If you would like

46
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
To skip this at we will be doing an episode on Wednesday

47
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Think hear that merited talking about

48
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
And so I wanted to to play this

49
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
And to have a conversation about it

50
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
I am apologizing

51
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
Hey if you don't want to listen to Nick Fuentes voice

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,808
You Are Not Alone we are doing this professional

53
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Before we get to that bit of us

54
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Pretty unpleasant business

55
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
Looks like a little moment to some

56
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
So first

57
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,911
Jordan's life is wholesome and I have a lazy eye too but I'm a hot chick thank you so much you are not follow through on

58
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Thank you very much I appreciate that

59
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,895
What's good next 14 calling never will thank you so much

60
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
I'm a policy wonk from Virginia

61
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
I'm a policy wonk

62
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
Terry from Virginia and Nathan rhymes with Satan and also have

63
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Big what's up too big and Eugene

64
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
Thank you very much to all of that but

65
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
And finally this this one was

66
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
I wasn't sure

67
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
Is another person who thought I couldn't pronounce their name

68
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
Spell out the first name

69
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Vayla

70
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
Okay bela-bela Viola I could go I could help you

71
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
Well if it's Bela and she says you can't pronounce

72
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Their name

73
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Then

74
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Viola

75
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
You're now policy want

76
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
I'm a policy wonk

77
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Okay

78
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,263
Souderton today this episode I was a little bit on inspired by some of the

79
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
Stuff is going on Iran Alex's world that so

80
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Poking around the website and posted a new video

81
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
This video is

82
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
Nick Fuentes on why we must preserve America's majority-white demographics

83
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Well

84
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Is

85
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Extreme

86
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
That title

87
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Is racist

88
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,399
So if your titles racist I imagine the thesis is far worse

89
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
It's a shocking blunt

90
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
Racist clickbait I found this to be bizarre

91
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
I think that

92
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,575
One of the things that I find the most interesting when I look at Infowars stuff and one of the things that keeps me

93
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
Engage is when things change

94
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
I've always been kind of interested in how things can change

95
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Because on some level they shouldn't

96
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Is yours shouldn't change

97
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
Decades-long conspiracy

98
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
That Alex understands fully change that much

99
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
From Trump is a con man is mobbed up and all this prove he's the greatest person in the world is going to save the country

100
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
That's interesting to me

101
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,951
That that sort of shift always is something that that sticks out

102
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
And I kind of feel like

103
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
We might be

104
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Kind of in the middle of

105
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
A chain of the Tabernacle

106
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,215
Text Big I'm a little bit worried because of

107
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
A title for a video by

108
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Like that

109
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,895
I mean cuz there's just no way to interpreted that anything other than

110
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
White people should be in charge cuz they're better

111
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
They're better in charge then other non-whites

112
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,927
That might be part of what his argument that you can make which is already silly and race

113
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
So

114
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
We

115
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,535
We're going to go over this 10-minute video that Nick post

116
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
It's a clip out of his speech

117
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
But he gave it his

118
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Political Acts

119
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Can committee conference or whatever

120
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
And I believe the title of it or at least something that's on the the the logo is America on canceled

121
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
Part of the reason is because

122
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
You know that sort of the theme of CPAP

123
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
Throwing it in their face that he's not allowed at Sea-Tac cancelled everywhere

124
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
I think that that framing is also going to be

125
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Bit of an issue for Alex

126
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
But

127
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Football here we go all right let's go to the white nationalist happy hour and everybody

128
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Getting ready to sit down

129
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Say that I'm a wife now

130
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
That's Ryan

131
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
We have another

132
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
Were there that's right yeah

133
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Run

134
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,303
Econo's out-of-work erases room a little bit

135
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,447
Yeah I know where you're sitting there was a little bit of

136
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Moment

137
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
One of the things that I want to make clear is that like

138
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,175
I could have probably found this entire speech and we could have gone over issue but I don't think that that's really

139
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Why I'm talking

140
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
About that okay

141
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
I'm talking about this because it's on Alex's site

142
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
Right we strictly Infowars

143
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,719
Podcast you do like we've talked about project Baker

144
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
There's other things

145
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
Nick Fuentes in and of himself is not somebody that I necessarily want

146
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Stood fully

147
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Devote

148
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Too much time to

149
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
However

150
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
He has entered Alex's fear in a way

151
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Becomes very relevant

152
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,711
To what we're talking about far more horrible things throughout this entire speech

153
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
But this is what is posted

154
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
And tacitly approved

155
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
By Alex Jones Infowars

156
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
Right it provides a context for Alex that cannot also you know like Alex Cano cannot go

157
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Go anywhere cannot go on Joe Rogan to be like

158
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
I don't know why they call me white nationalists this is why

159
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
This is on your side incontrovertible you are a white National

160
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,591
It's maybe not because Nick has an interesting definition about

161
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
The reason they call me a white Nash

162
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I am aghast

163
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Transformation

164
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
America's

165
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
I want a white Nation

166
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
White

167
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
White people in America

168
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Which is

169
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Never said anything

170
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Multiracial country

171
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Unstoppable

172
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
We is a nation

173
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Figure out how to navigate

174
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Living in a very big

175
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Diverse

176
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
I wish it wasn't that way

177
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
That's the way that it is

178
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
So the first important to note here is that Nick is very clearly saying that he wishes the United States wasn't a diverse country

179
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,679
He doesn't advocate for a whites-only country because it's an impractical goal

180
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:25,567
It's Logistics issue not an ideological want listen you can't shoot for the stars every time man

181
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,919
If it weren't an impractical things pursue it stands to reason the base

182
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,527
Lakewood wanna eliminate that diversity that he doesn't seem to enjoy in our society

183
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,183
The other important thing to note here is that Nick is creating a false definition of white nationalism in order to pretend that the label doesn't fit him

184
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
What does it mean to advocate for a country with no non-white people in it to advocate

185
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
For white nationalism

186
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
Some among the crowd probably do wish to see a whites-only country but the definition of white nationalism is a bit broader than that

187
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
What are the trademark beliefs that defines a person's belief as being white nationalist is the belief that white people need to retain

188
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
An absolute grip on power in this country

189
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
Particularly by retaining a firm majority in terms of population

190
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,439
Mix created a false version of the definition in order to avoid the baggage that's associated with it but then that everyone's calling him names

191
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,047
But don't apply but this is really just an elementary rhetorical trick

192
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
It's nonsense

193
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,703
Well I mean the thing that is undercutting everything he saying is the idea that we need to stop

194
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
These Trends and then saying they are

195
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Virtually Unstoppable

196
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,175
Which okay so if the birth rate and such are virtually Unstoppable how do you expect

197
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
To change the trend

198
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
And it would obviously be getting rid of people try deportation or whatever

199
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Obviously violence for them is on the table but apparently has something to add

200
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
K40 because like what if

201
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
You know people

202
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Don't want

203
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
To leave well I mean this is a majority-white country I don't understand

204
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
And I hate these

205
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,103
People gets into a little bit of a history lesson that is

206
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Not fully

207
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
We as a nation

208
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
You're going to have to figure out how

209
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
Very big and died

210
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
I wish it wasn't that way

211
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
That's the way that it is

212
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Singer Janis Ian

213
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Like that

214
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
They call me back because I'm opposed

215
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
The

216
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
If you don't know

217
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
America's

218
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Minority

219
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Probably with

220
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Less than 50

221
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Percent

222
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Population

223
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Pretty incredible

224
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Not incredible

225
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
What

226
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Master

227
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
The transformation

228
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Such a short.

229
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
It was just recently

230
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
When the demographics

231
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
90%

232
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
And 10%.

233
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
And that's how was

234
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
The beginning

235
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Country

236
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Colonies

237
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
It's been roughly like that since

238
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
The 17th

239
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
1600

240
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
The order of

241
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Population is being replaced

242
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Wow

243
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
In fairness the US population was 205 million in 1970 as opposed to / 320 million now

244
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Little bit different

245
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Also

246
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
Based on US Census Data

247
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
It feels like it's a

248
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Exaggerating a little bit

249
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,103
You know if you go back to 1972 census shows that the country was 87 point

250
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
5% White

251
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
2010 that's 72.4 /

252
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Additionally

253
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
I don't think it's super helpful to go back to some of that like old census data

254
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:55,231
From like let's say I don't know prior to 1954 The Colony days

255
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
You know the terminology

256
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
Classification that was used to describe races very different back then

257
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
If you go back to route

258
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Some of the ways people are catalogued are slurs

259
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
It's outrageous the weird

260
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,039
Open Mixer be a little more careful because if you go back to far you might find numbers that constitute a problem

261
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
For the argument

262
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
For example if you look at the 1790 census

263
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Sleeves made up

264
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047
43% of the population of South Carolina and almost 40% of the population of Virginia

265
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
I don't know what he's I don't know what he's talking

266
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
I mean I mean I do but

267
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
I suppose be very simple argument against that of course is

268
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
You know the country

269
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
That we that land was here before even the 17th century

270
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
Boy that's a second quite a drastic demographic shift

271
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
Since that demographic I understand completely

272
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
So

273
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
Yeah maybe you should shut the f***

274
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Yeah probably

275
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,375
He's concerned about this changing of population beak

276
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Cuz

277
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
The United States really only is the way it is for a particular reason

278
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
This isn't good

279
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Malaysian is being replaced

280
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Prince Andrew

281
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Children

282
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
People hear that

283
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Like that

284
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
The problem

285
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
The problem is this

286
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
The problem is

287
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
The problem is that

288
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Just like men and wear

289
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
People

290
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
Are not interchangeable

291
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Country is right now

292
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Lived here

293
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
This country as we know it early says

294
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
What's an expression of

295
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
European

296
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
People

297
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Civilization

298
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
And wasn't

299
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Way because of

300
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
European people

301
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,983
It was a certain way because of how European people

302
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
The ability to understand American history

303
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Lost just like

304
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Yellow like

305
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
No

306
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,415
But just no zero no just zero. Do you know why you can get from one side of the country to the other

307
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Chinese people that's part of the game like

308
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
Is everywhere everybody is everywhere the point of the country is that everybody from everywhere

309
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,215
And that that is a big part of the contributions that have been made by people who

310
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Have roots

311
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
Stay in other parts of the world have made America what it is there's so much of the frappe the fabric of what we

312
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,479
What we consider important and culturally relevant

313
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
That is not from

314
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Hahaha

315
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
I don't know even

316
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
What

317
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Strict definition

318
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
Naked try to use I mean go back to the go back to the f****** colonies you do think that they thought that I

319
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
Worst people in Italian people acted the same European way of

320
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,007
Probably probably not I think that is a difficulty for this Ark

321
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
The relative definition overtime

322
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
Yeah

323
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Did United States exist

324
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Yeah

325
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Yeah I just

326
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
I don't I don't like this

327
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Because

328
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,647
You know the saying the people aren't interchangeable because based on

329
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
Your roots where you come from you act different

330
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Your culture is not the same

331
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Great

332
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Sure

333
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
You know what I really do hate that I can get Ethiopian food if I want it it's awful that I

334
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
I don't have to fly to Ethiopia

335
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
That's the problem which

336
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
I don't I don't I don't know what he

337
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
No Depot are great

338
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Okay there

339
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Another animals

340
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Lance

341
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
The more complicated

342
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Technology

343
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Subtle

344
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Subtle but significant

345
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
You might think that somebody

346
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Buy Nike shoes

347
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Assimilated

348
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Not the case

349
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
We find it

350
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Superman

351
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Create

352
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
The same conditions in a

353
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Fans created

354
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
No

355
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
They don't

356
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
This is a matter of fact

357
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,583
I don't even know what he's expecting of

358
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Immigrant

359
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Okay that's okay

360
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
So

361
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,495
Don't know how you gauge that when immigrants came here

362
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
They start their own country and take the land from other people

363
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,015
Then they didn't create the same conditions that the Europeans created here

364
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Everybody knows that wow okay well I don't think

365
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
Like that's the only one that makes sense from the word teeth

366
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
Yeah he seems to just have a problem with

367
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
I guess the idea of

368
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Neighborhood

369
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,983
I guess he just doesn't like the idea that there are non-white neighborhood

370
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Yeah I mean

371
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,359
This is so transparently b******* just like that

372
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
This is

373
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Clearly

374
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,063
Whatever is whatever the word is whatever it is immigrants or whatever

375
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
It experienced words

376
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,463
Incitement like that's all that matters to him if it was if we were in

377
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
Different times he be like at the Irish if you were in different times he be like

378
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703
We we got to hate to love the Mongols like it doesn't matter all it is is a tool

379
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
To get people

380
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
Do act for him

381
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
What's power out of this and I'm terrified

382
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Map

383
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
So I wanted to be terrified of is that the he's from the same city as us

384
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Chicago

385
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
And they create the

386
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Same conditions and

387
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Created before

388
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
No

389
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
They don't

390
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
And this is a matter of

391
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
If you look at all these

392
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Different communities

393
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
I live in Chicago

394
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Chicago is a third wife

395
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
When you drive

396
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Gas

397
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
Redlining

398
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
I don't want to live in Mexico

399
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
And when I drive through the Southside

400
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
It would look like

401
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Somalia

402
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
You should go there maybe you should check out the Southside you dumbass

403
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
Dial at that time White Sox stadium is

404
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:27,328
Basically the middle of box why not

405
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
Pretty sure he lives in the suburbs

406
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Of course

407
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah I don't understand I don't understand what the

408
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
This affects his life in any meaningful way other than

409
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:44,992
He gets mad seeing people of other the backgrounds other communities

410
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Living

411
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Prelate

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,440
That takes me back to that joke that he said in the last Clipper two clips ago or whatever where he's like

413
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
I like them

414
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,048
As long as they're over there and everybody laughs and he's like just joking and gesturing

415
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
And then he literally says you know the same thing but

416
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Deadly serious

417
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,240
I don't go to the South side right and that there was no I'm joking they left

418
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
Did the joke is that he does mean it

419
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
He's deadly serious.

420
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
But he also doesn't mean it cuz he's also not fine if these other people are over there

421
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,576
Ghost of us outside

422
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,952
I don't know man I don't even know how to set up these clips

423
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Cuz it's just rolling

424
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
Going through the interview

425
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
And I just

426
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Just find everything in it disgusting

427
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
You know what Detroit looks the same

428
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Many cities

429
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Tinseltown

430
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Where are the Democrats

431
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Consummate

432
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
What

433
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
Policies work in Haiti and everywhere else in the world

434
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
The exact same way

435
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
And they put it down right here

436
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Becomes a problem

437
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Country happens to be

438
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
My home

439
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
So one of the things I think is important about that clip Beyond just the

440
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Covert

441
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
You know bigotry that runs throughout everything

442
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
This is counter to the Infowars narrative

443
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,368
Yeah this is counter to the larger conspiracy that Alex cells because

444
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
He's saying

445
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,304
What is it in these countries where are the Democrats in those countries where are the Socialist policies in these countries know

446
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Intrinsic

447
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
These people

448
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Come from other places

449
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
And

450
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:45,056
It's within themselves it's not even the devil

451
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Right

452
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
It's people with big human spirit that I hate

453
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,016
I think I think that one of the things that's important to recognize is the

454
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
This is

455
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
Not compatible really

456
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,184
With the diversion of the world that Alex tries to sell

457
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
That conspiracy is undermined

458
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Bye

459
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Knicks

460
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
Rhetoric

461
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
And that seems to me to be

462
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,448
Enough of a reason not to have him on your website

463
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,288
Well if you're if you're fine with the other stuff that comes along with it

464
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
I would think it's probably bad for business

465
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
For you to be yelling about how

466
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,712
It's the global is to the left of China and all this

467
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,088
And then have Nick Fuentes be like no it's not it's just right

468
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
Alex

469
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Skin color my man

470
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
The problem is the people look different

471
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
REI really so

472
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
Again

473
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:45,728
Now he's mad about people packing up their country and moving it to America

474
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
At what point in time are we ever going to deal with America only being short number of years old

475
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Bad never

476
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
I'm going to go with never that was like

477
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
Fine up until like 17

478
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,856
79 that's what those the cutoff

479
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Fair enough

480
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,488
Now we enter the portion of this clip that is

481
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
The fear tactic space

482
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
America

483
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
I don't know

484
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Where else

485
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Coming to coming to your neighborhood

486
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Your place

487
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
And your people

488
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Look at all the way

489
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
Utah

490
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Number two

491
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
You're not sending them there

492
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Southern border

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Where are they

494
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Nevada where they sign them to Minnesota

495
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
In Michigan

496
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Wisconsin

497
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
And they're flying them

498
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
To your neighbors

499
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
Cities and everybody sees it

500
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
So I mean it can't get much clearer than the

501
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,976
They and you like Autumn me that you portrayed here and it's

502
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Gross just say they're coming for your white women

503
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,864
That's it just say that

504
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,984
They don't they don't need any more than that they don't need rhetoric they just need to hear that they're coming for the white with

505
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,128
Even like be fine with that

506
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Where classic

507
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,248
Remember this song

508
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,600
You do a lot of people think that segregation ended but I think

509
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Bring it back

510
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,744
Okay I have these folks coming to your school's your neighborhood

511
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Yeah

512
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
You do a lot of courageous chill

513
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Broke

514
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Through

515
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
F****** ranks of National Guard members

516
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Just to go to school

517
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
And you're like they're sending them to our god I

518
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,176
It's pretty bad Bruno it's from the past man

519
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
This is this is kind of where this next clip

520
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
Elevated into like

521
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
I cannot believe that Alex is allowing for this on his

522
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Platform

523
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
I know this because

524
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
America is not

525
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
We like to go to work and

526
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Are we like to go to Mars

527
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
America is

528
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Supposed to be

529
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Nation

530
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
Which is constitutionally

531
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Regions

532
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Communities

533
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Neighborhood

534
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
How are you

535
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Real community

536
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
In real neighborhood

537
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
People don't even speak the same language on your

538
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
A real community

539
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
If people don't

540
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Religion

541
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
But this is a fact of our nature

542
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Can you have a community

543
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
I mean

544
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
That is outrageous

545
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
I just don't even know

546
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Your head is in your hand

547
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,856
Very very much breathing through it have a community of people look

548
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Wild

549
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
Just want you know what you can you can I've lived in so many of them. They're way better than all of the

550
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
All white ones I've ever lived in

551
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,448
It's insane I honestly don't even really know where this logic

552
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
It could be grounded

553
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Like at what point do looks

554
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,128
Like where it where is the relevant difference in looks that you can have a community with somebody

555
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Skin color

556
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Facial hair choice

557
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,320
I think is it how much how much uniformity is required in order to have a neighborhood

558
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
Where somebody across the street from you eat

559
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
Honey Nut Cheerios when in your home you are eating plain Cheerios

560
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:58,912
Exactly you can't have those in the same neighborhood I need segregated Cheerios neighborhood

561
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,728
I want the Jets in the sharks in different neighborhoods

562
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Get them all out of here I want

563
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
White sole

564
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:10,688
What you really seeing is that there is there something going on with Nick where he doesn't feel like

565
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,272
He's capable or able or anyone is capable

566
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,856
Of having Community with people who speak different languages who have a

567
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
From religious belief

568
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Or whoever

569
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Different looks

570
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:27,072
Great he thinks that about himself he has universalized at everybody else

571
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Switch is stupid

572
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
But he's saying that in terms of like

573
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,568
His own ability to make a community matter in other places where he is not

574
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,176
Other people are existing totally fine

575
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,784
But what's fascinating about this is he's trying to make both arguments

576
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,344
That not only does he not want to

577
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
Live or is it he's unable to live

578
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
In a diverse community

579
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
But the communities

580
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,792
Are equally unable to exam

581
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,912
That's the one he never goes to

582
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
That's really f***** up

583
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
And the fact that it really comes down to

584
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360
Being so over that like 82 looks

585
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
How can you have a community with me

586
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
People who look different than you

587
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
I cannot believe

588
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Did Alex

589
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,112
It would be fine with this

590
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
Cuz I think it's true

591
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
I think he's our two similar but

592
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,000
This is so optically bad

593
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
I mean even Alex takes great pains

594
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,680
Needs to go out of his way to be like it is

595
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Not just like how you look different f*** off light up you look different you should be in a different Community also

596
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
So I don't want you in that Community because somehow I believe that you can't coexist with my fellow whites

597
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
Be back in a different community and guess what

598
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:59,232
I'm going to need to take that land later that's going to need to be my community as well it's

599
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Yeah

600
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
God how can you

601
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
Cheez-Its made it there's only two ways to go for them

602
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Is if they win

603
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
It is

604
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
The country then becomes a f******

605
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,128
Non-stop conquering country trying to steal everybody else's s*** to

606
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
Or the whole thing falls apart and they just

607
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
Separate into smaller and smaller groups that hate each other like it's bananas house stupid all of this is it's pretty.

608
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
But yeah

609
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
McNichols

610
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
This is a fact of our nature

611
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Can you have

612
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Community

613
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,824
Who's the courageous man there

614
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
And that's the question I do

615
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
And if we want to preserve

616
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Communities

617
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Bring over

618
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Different Valley

619
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Different ways of life

620
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
But they are still

621
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
I need to buy

622
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
What

623
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Do you really want to bring

624
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Nashua

625
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
And you would be in favor of cohesion

626
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
But the cohesion and the communities are in

627
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Possible if you look different

628
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,400
So you have to have uniform communities that's what it means to be an American nationalist

629
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,752
Snap some of these people who are not white who are coming over these immigrant Folk

630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,384
They may seem totally the these changes for these differences are almost imperceptible

631
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
But they're there

632
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,736
Guess what even white people you see

633
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:02,880
Secretly they might be harboring some imperceptible difference between the two of you

634
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
What kind of

635
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
Might be where the next stage of his Workshop

636
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
But I say

637
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,984
Yes it's it's a it's a way of being a I can't really make this argument but I'm going to go ahead and

638
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Well I mean

639
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,616
Fundamentally the the biggest issue with his argument is it is

640
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Thoroughly intrinsic

641
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
You

642
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
Can not change

643
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Simply impossible

644
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,112
No there's no way that if you did move to a let's say

645
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Non majority white neighborhood

646
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
You could change your behavior

647
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
He does not allow for that possibility like not not even

648
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Not even like you shouldn't have

649
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
2 or anything like that he's saying this from a place of

650
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
It is not possible

651
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,592
Ulta coexist so your country of origin is deterministic of what

652
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Kind of

653
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
Behavior you're going to

654
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Yep manifest

655
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
Any circumstance

656
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
It's

657
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
You are not an individual you are a block

658
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,744
Now what people are just white people have a lot of individual things that's why we can create a country like the United States

659
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Alicia

660
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Brutal

661
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Yeah yeah it's pretty bad

662
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
Now at this point explains that once

663
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,240
Deep there's a no longer a white

664
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,080
Majority in the country will be a worse country

665
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,920
An inferior country

666
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Nation

667
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,856
Lucy.

668
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Do they call me away

669
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Because I say

670
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Truce

671
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
The nasty

672
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
America

673
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Won't be a wife

674
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
And America will be

675
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
Country

676
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
What ignorable

677
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
And then when you begin

678
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
The question is

679
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
The country

680
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
I wonder why it is we get it

681
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
The same

682
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Or will it be

683
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
The conscious

684
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Worse

685
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Hey

686
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
I don't know

687
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Hey if we end slavery

688
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,936
Is the country going to be better

689
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:30,336
The same or worse you will have changed the balance of power if you allow black people to vote will the country be

690
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Be better

691
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,944
Or the same or Worse cuz it will be different than

692
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
Desert these arguments eBay

693
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Very similar

694
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,904
I mean like I think I think it's just that this is kind of these dancing around

695
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
Defining anything yeah

696
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,768
What is it mean for the country to be better or worse right

697
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Fortuitous

698
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
On the grand scale or for you

699
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Individually

700
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:58,496
Guy who can't deal with people who look different right what change is

701
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Acceptable is any change

702
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Acceptable

703
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
A progressive tax

704
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
Like what if what

705
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Change towards

706
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
America isn't acceptable

707
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
Like within the boundaries of possibility

708
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Stuff to say

709
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,952
Right so if this is the end of his speech and I have some thoughts that I want to share

710
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
If we get it

711
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Will that country be

712
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
B Team

713
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Or will it be

714
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
The conscious

715
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
Very simple

716
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Country is changing

717
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
Born not interchangeable

718
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
We can't just take one guy and

719
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
It's going to be different

720
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
What we know about where they

721
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
America

722
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
We don't want that

723
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Happens

724
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
I want to live in the

725
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
My ancestor

726
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Creative

727
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
I want

728
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Ancestors

729
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Nit

730
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Stories about

731
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
Divider Grandpa

732
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Cigarette

733
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
Please don't ride the Subway at night

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Ride the bus

735
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
And can you imagine something

736
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Like that

737
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Look at our cities

738
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
What's going on

739
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,144
At the end of the clip has lived in Chicago for the last decade

740
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,936
Preco videos I could

741
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,240
Imagine riding buses and trains after Dark

742
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
Did all the time

743
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
It's awesome that was how I got around

744
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,504
And you can just hop on the train and you'd wind up somewhere in Chicago

745
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
And sometimes you didn't get to the right spot but the powers

746
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,280
Video Jordan is disgusting

747
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
And it's a pretty clear articulation of white nationalist beliefs which are being presented with a nice pre-emptive explanation that these are not in

748
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
In fact a lot of people say these are white nationalists beliefs and that's only because I want to wait

749
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,432
If you look at the beginning of the speech and the things that he ends up at

750
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Expressing

751
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
What you have is

752
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
I'm not racist but

753
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
Basically in speech for NASA

754
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
This in itself

755
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
Isn't really that groundbreaker

756
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
Contact you can expect from someone like Nick but now it's being posted and hosted on Alex's own website which is pi

757
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Kind of amazing Attaway

758
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:37,216
Who's representing looming problem for Alex that I don't think that he's going to be able to navigate very well

759
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,312
And that problem may be coming to a head much quicker than he expect

760
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,408
At least if it's can of the comments on this video are any indication

761
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,992
I don't spend too much time in the comment section on his website mostly

762
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,088
Why's mostly cuz a lot of it is incoherent anger slurs and

763
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:59,488
Anyone can post whatever they want anonymously so it really feels productive to assume the individual comments mean anything

764
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:04,352
However the comments on this video or fascinating and that they seem to break down into toucan

765
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,936
The first group is people who seem to agree with Nick

766
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
They seemed pretty mad

767
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,824
Pretty comfortable with just wearing their white nationalism on their sleeve like this one

768
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,688
The differences between races isn't just skin color deal with it Boomers to each race their own nature

769
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,016
Was that Boomers that

770
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,368
So some of these people on Nick side let's say are a little more blunt

771
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,952
But what I find far more interesting are the people in the second camp

772
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
Which is the camp that recognizes that this kind of content represents a bit of a departure from what Infowars is supposed to be about

773
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
One person something up pretty well

774
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
I can't believe how many racists are in this community

775
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
I thought we were better than that

776
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,408
I hated the libtards call everything racist but this guy is actually racist y'all we don't want this s***

777
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,760
Scaring our I think they might scarring the name of Infowars I'm more right

778
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
That's

779
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
That's

780
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
Right on man

781
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:03,232
Another commenter makes a good point except for the part where he's like I can't believe I mean man, I didn't realize

782
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
I'm all about it

783
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Man another commenter makes another good point

784
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
If I sent a family member a link

785
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
Banned. Video hoping to that for them to educate themselves about covid vaccine election fraud or the cabal end

786
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Wo agenda

787
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,664
And the first thing they see featured up top of the page as a headline like

788
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,016
Why we must preserve America's white majority just doesn't look good

789
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,880
Even if you're in the Infowars world you believe the narratives and everything

790
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:36,256
You can recognize that this is something you do not want to be associated with cuz it's on its face

791
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
A little bit

792
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
F***** up

793
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,608
I like Infowars

794
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:47,008
It's because he says globalist instead of Jews and then I don't have to think about it okay that's why I lie

795
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,080
I can forward you can't just be saying white all the time

796
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
There's a number people in the comment section to bring up things like no wait until the media picks

797
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
This up

798
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:00,831
I got making it clear that they know that this is going to be something very attackable which Alex chosen to associate with

799
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,183
And now the audience of the show is going to be associated with it to unless they clearly reject

800
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,047
That's a tough position to be in and you can see a lot of people decide that they're just going to retreat

801
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,399
Intuit comfortable assumption that Nick is actually a Fed plant drink

802
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:20,799
Check the bacon in floors look bad by making videos that are transparently racist so Alex will look racist by extension

803
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
That sounds great

804
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:28,479
There's a deep division in this comments section and it feels like this could be hiding in one of two directions and neither I think look

805
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Good for Alec

806
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,855
One possibility is that Alex keeps Nick around and let him have his channel on the web

807
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:39,487
Mix clearly already testing the waters to see what he can get away with it if this video is any indication

808
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
But he should probably feel no trepidation about pushing even

809
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
In further

810
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
If things go this way it seems like there's a contingent of listeners who won't support that

811
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,007
It could lead to them questioning why Alex would distribute this

812
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Kind of contact

813
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,639
Particularly given her naked Alex disagree on the very basis of the conspiracy they're fighting

814
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,223
Who is Mick rejecting the China Democrat socialism big Boogeyman

815
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
But Alex uses to scare the audience

816
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,367
Tell me other Road you have the option of Alex kicking Nick off the channel

817
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,719
Which only serve to alienate the more extreme elements of Alex's audience

818
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:17,887
This is a dangerous game that you get into when you make so much of your political identity about how your viewpoints are secretly correct and everyone said

819
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Answering you because of it

820
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,567
If you ever need to censor someone you really put yourself in a difficult position because whatever arguments and attacks you've used against

821
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,151
People censoring you can now be used against you and make no mistake

822
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,199
That's precisely what would happen if Alex

823
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
Get your neck off the platform

824
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
Situation because he left

825
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
You letting it get involved

826
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,951
He kind of has to deal with the association

827
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Or

828
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Go against his

829
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,071
Banned. Video principle

830
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,911
And I think either way you're going to have a certain amount of the audience be like

831
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
Why are you doing this

832
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:58,591
It was actually kind of heartening to look in the comments section and people like what the fuc

833
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Like I believe

834
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,223
Does Federal Reserve sugar see I've been there for a while

835
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
3 cm

836
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
Got the FED we got it man I'm with you

837
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,583
I like to see I am fine with going to the same bathroom as other people I wanted to focus on things that were created

838
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,935
Goodbye people who worked on George Wallace his campaign

839
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,591
Perfect

840
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,383
That's well done.

841
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,199
Like it's so bizarre though

842
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,343
Honestly I think that I might be making a little bit more of this season than actually exist like

843
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
There's a decent chance that this will just be a

844
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
Little bubbling thing or comments are always a vocal minority

845
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:53,119
You never really know because it could lead to no chaos on

846
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,655
Play Infowars front door

847
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,727
I also see this as kind of a difficult pickle

848
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
The Alex

849
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,799
If not addressed

850
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
And handle

851
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
Fairly well could end up with

852
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Lot of

853
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Lot of negative

854
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Dicey material being posted

855
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
On on Alex's own website

856
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
This one's free

857
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Alright

858
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,583
This is the only good advice I'm going to give to Alex

859
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
On purpose

860
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Get Nick

861
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:33,567
And Doctor Stevie pees on the same show TV peas is not going to like what's going down there cuz Nick is knocking

862
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:38,431
Can I handle b******* those same way that other people probably not

863
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Get that as the fight

864
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
That would be Alexa

865
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
Exact

866
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
That's how you do it

867
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:49,951
Yeah I mean it was great to have Nick debate Barnes

868
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,535
Let's get let's get speakers at math you want to get rid of them

869
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,935
You know that's going to be a fight you you got rid of David night and nobody really bad it and I there in fact people were more in this TV

870
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
So even the racist will be like

871
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
History is boring I mean it's boring white nationalism isn't it

872
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,783
Okay let's exterminate non-whites you know like it's banal but that's a Stevi B's

873
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
He's in control of white nationalism

874
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,671
Pick up people in betting it all the way to the fullest self

875
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
True

876
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
Countries over here to kill I don't know everything

877
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
It would be nice

878
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,399
Be nice to just see how they would interact

879
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
I want it

880
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
I want to bed anyway visible shorter episode like I said to take a little look at this and

881
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
Will be back on Wednesday with a

882
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,943
A normal episode Hindi but until then Jordan

883
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,319
Do we have a website like we do

884
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,719
We are on Twitter that knowledge underscore fighting that go to bed Jordan

885
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
Find a local charity or bail Fund in your area

886
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
To help out people do it.

887
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,399
Pitbull

888
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
