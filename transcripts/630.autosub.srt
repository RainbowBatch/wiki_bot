1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
Knowledge

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Dollartree.com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,440
Acknowledge

6
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
No Jordan hey what's going on vacation I'm here

7
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,168
On my lonesome sitting here recording an introduction

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,288
And I guess I should give a break spot

9
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
How many messages I got about how Sofia is a robot

10
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
Was about giving a Saudi Arabian citizenship a few years back

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,136
I still think it didn't make sense based on what Carrie was saying in our last episode

12
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
But in my defense one of the reasons that I'd sort of forgotten about that story get filed in a similar place in my brain

13
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
Brain has the alpacino movie Simone

14
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
I thought those became became the same story

15
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
In my head and I just I lost track of it

16
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Anyway hey folks

17
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Here's what's going on

18
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
We have a little bit of an episode to get to this is hard without somebody sitting across the desk

19
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
I'll tell you that

20
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
I've already lost Steam for the reduction

21
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,512
Explain what's going on but first i'm going to say hello to some new no walks out there

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
BBW hater

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Be a crater

28
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904

00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
I'm a policy wonk

33
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,712
Heroin

34
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,136
Freakishly large

35
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
Alright so look here's the deal

36
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Evans kind of always the case whenever we end up having a break of some sort

37
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Like let's say

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,008
One of the co-host goes to France something happens that requires attention in

39
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,896
And that makes things difficult usually will have to wait until we get back together and then trying to play catch-up

40
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736
In this case Alex Jones sue the government

41
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
Jordan life

42
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,464
I'm going to be gone for a week and by that time something else crazy will it happen will be

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
You know who be too much to play catch-up on I think

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,632
I decided to go do a little sneaky snake episode and so what I did

45
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
I was I reached out to Andrew Torres of the opening arguments podcast

46
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
Find a cool dude and I wanted to

47
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
What was going on with this suit that Alex had brought

48
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
Against the January 6th Commission

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
A committee excuse me and that is now what we shall play is today's episode so

50
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Sneaky Snake it up

51
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
I will be back we're back

52
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,471
Well ladies and gentlemen hello welcome to interview

53
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Today Alexa

54
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
One is that Alex

55
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Cannot stop getting himself

56
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
And legal trouble

57
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
To the point where we need multiple legal experts

58
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Stu to cover all the ground

59
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
All the territory that he's getting into

60
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
And he has the world's worst timing where Jordan leaves for vacation and then the next day he decides

61
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
To sue the government

62
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
And we can't wait till Jordan gets back from France welcome

63
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Cast from the opening arguments podcast

64
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Amber Torres thank you for joining me

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
Out there thank you so much for having me on the show I've been

66
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,223
Looking forward to coming on for a while we've had do you guys come come on over it

67
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Opening arguments

68
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Stuff

69
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
Seems like a propitious time talking the law and Alex Jones there's a

70
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Heavy overlap

71
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Subject

72
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
Don't look

73
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Very promising

74
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
4 per hour

75
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah that's that's

76
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
I will I will accept that as a

77
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
Seems like a pretty pretty

78
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
Pretty clear based on the trends you know Vic we had the the default judgments that happened in the Sandy Hook case

79
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Just recently

80
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Hey now

81
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Total mess with the January 6th

82
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Committee

83
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
Yep this is a truly incompetent

84
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,655
Kind of complaint niani judge that on the basis of the

85
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Comparison be

86
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Between this complaint

87
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,055
And other doomed lawsuits are filed by

88
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Similarly situated

89
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Individuals who have been

90
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Subpoenaed by the 16 committee and are making the same arguments Alex Jones is making here only Alex

91
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Jones is making them worse

92
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,975
So making some pretty exaggerated sort of claim

93
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
And also his asks

94
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Seems to be a little bit ambitious sure we'll get to

95
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:34,495
I was looking at Ali Alexander's lawsuit cuz he's also filed

96
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
There's a lot of similarities

97
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Hollywood

98
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Similarly

99
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
You have the

100
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
The lawsuit filed by

101
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
By Mark Meadows right and they and they are all

102
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
Designed to do the same thing

103
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Which is to quash

104
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Subpoenas that have been issued

105
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
To third-party

106
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
Providers to turn over cell phone

107
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,471
Look like the AT&T subpoenas that they had they put out

108
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Exactly right however

109
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
What are the things that the future of those other lawsuits not a feature of this lawsuit is that you will note that AT&T

110
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
He is not a party

111
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
To this lawsuit

112
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Typically it again

113
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,487
Give you the disclaimer from opening arguments right like I have a real practicing law

114
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
But but

115
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
I think it's safe to say

116
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
That as a lawyer

117
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
Wendy wants to get relief against somebody

118
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Uu name that person

119
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
In your lawsuit

120
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
So if I'm understanding correctly these other lawsuits like the alley Alexander or Mark Meadows 18

121
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
He is listed in the lawsuit

122
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,367
Verizon for provoke

123
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
French for Alex

124
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Not

125
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
Not

126
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
And in fact

127
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
I mean one of the

128
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Reasons why

129
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
One of the few things that

130
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
You might actually be able to accomplish

131
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
With

132
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Bringing a lawsuit

133
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Use

134
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
Delaying a cellphone carrier for

135
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
From turning over

136
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Your cell phone record

137
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455
Typically the response that they will take his

138
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,087
Hey we've got us a bit rate that will call you up another pursuant to our terms & conditions

139
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
We have received a subpoena for your records

140
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
We're going to turn them over by

141
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
XJ8 unless you can show us a

142
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Court-ordered

143
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
It says

144
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
We should not turn the boat

145
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
End

146
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Typically

147
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
Somebody who has

148
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Incel

149
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Subpoenaed people's phone record

150
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Zigbee the phone

151
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
The owner rapist

152
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
The client

153
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Can I call up and be like hey

154
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
We don't have a court order right now but we do have is

155
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
A

156
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Valid

157
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
Pending lawsuit in which we've challenged the basis

158
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
Of the subpoena and you know you should

159
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Probably not

160
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
During that time

161
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Play I like giving the phone records over can't be undone and maybe this lawsuit will work in and having it

162
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Injunction

163
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
And so like let's hold off on it basic

164
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
That's it that's exactly right

165
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
But

166
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
I noticed

167
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,271
Is that the date that AT&T gave in their letter seems to have passed already

168
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,695
Kind of interesting the way these years there have been other

169
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Lawsuits that have served

170
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,303
Similarly been filed kind of right on the day of

171
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
This is the first one I've seen

172
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,959
That. That has been filed after the date at which AT&T said they were going to produce documents

173
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
And by the way although this lawsuit

174
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Quest declaratory and injunctive relief

175
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
You've explained this well in

176
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Covering

177
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
The Alex Jones interminable numerous

178
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
This is a situation where there is not a specific

179
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,303
Motion for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order accompanying this loss

180
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
And typically that's what you do right like if

181
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
If I need if if I know that 18 tsp

182
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Can I turn over one of my

183
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Lions record

184
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Then I go into court today to get a temporary

185
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
What that does is that preserve the status

186
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Ask what I make

187
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
The argument that you articulate

188
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Right which is

189
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,087
Look if they turn over the records right you can't put the genie back in the bottle

190
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,927
So you don't give us a stay of a couple of days

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Let us breathe this up

192
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
And then you do the court

193
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Applies 88

194
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
A four-part legal test

195
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
I couldn't figure out whether you can

196
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Continue that

197
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
Over you know and that a preliminary injunction usually lasts a couple of weeks

198
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
And then you do you can get a permanent injunction

199
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
After that

200
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
And so

201
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,247
What would it would have he ever does is it buys you time to then fully breathe

202
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
I did a preliminary injunction

203
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
It seems like it's also like a pretty reasonable request the most

204
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Courtney's probably G

205
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
So the wait what work would do is

206
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
Acorda employees

207
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
And it's a little bit counterintuitive

208
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
The two most important

209
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Things

210
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:24,287
That you look for in in granting injunctive relief are number one is there a bullhorn

211
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,895
Reparable harm that means is this a thing that money can buy

212
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
6 or no

213
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Write something that money can fix

214
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
That's not a rapper

215
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,599
Write like it so it'll it'll be really really bad if I too bad right like that's

216
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
That's what courts exist to do is to sort of direct money from Party 8 apart

217
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
But I guess I feel like if he would scream

218
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
I did I buy vibe

219
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,543
Channeling a little Jordan

220
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
And then the second thing that the

221
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
The court is going to look at is

222
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
The likelihood of sick

223
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Success on them

224
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Sure

225
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
That's going to seem really really weird right

226
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Emily b as a lawyer

227
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
Practicing it is kind of weird to ask

228
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
The court to judge

229
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
A case that it hasn't heard yet

230
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
And so

231
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
For example when you Prevail on an injunction right

232
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Usually it's a pretty strong signal to the other side

233
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
When you lose on an injunction that

234
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
It doesn't mean anything

235
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
It just means

236
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
The court

237
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,967
Decided that the factors weren't your favorite says

238
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,599
Based on what we've heard right now we think the plaintiffs are very likely to win

239
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
In the event that this would go to trial

240
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
If I'm a defense lawyer

241
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,535
I take that very seriously right

242
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Epic Sports

243
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Prejudge this case

244
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
So

245
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,471
You know we can talk about all of the other factors but basically when I go into court and I won an injunction

246
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Those are the things that I wanted my

247
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Irreparable harm

248
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
And

249
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah we're we're way ahead on the merits

250
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
I don't feel like those standards are met

251
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Not here

252
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
What are the things

253
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Ed

254
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
I buy pouches of this is a little bit of a rabbit

255
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Enjoyable sure

256
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
What are ways which I teach people to read complaints over on opening arguments

257
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Is back

258
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,703
It's right you scroll to the end you'll get a caption then you scroll to the end

259
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
And then you work your way back

260
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
And that's because

261
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Lawyers do that

262
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
People are reading the complaint

263
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
From front to back

264
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
And like that first paragraph is just an introductory

265
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,575
Inflammatory like summary paragraph of stuff

266
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
Really a Republican

267
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
Right

268
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Yes I'm none of that means anything

269
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
What I want I didn't what I want to know is

270
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,351
Write the important stuff.

271
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,727
This is is also kind of fun because when you scroll to the bottom of this hundred

272
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
23-page

273
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
You will see that they have attached

274
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
90

275
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
4 pages

276
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Authority

277
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
And I want to tell you with somebody who

278
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
This is civil litigation like

279
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
All the time

280
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,343
That's not a thing you're supposed to do to your complaint

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
That was one of the questions that I was going to ask you

282
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,047
Is it normal to attach the entire rules for the House of Representatives

283
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Onto your

284
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
Your complaint

285
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
No it's not normal in any way right oats

286
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
That's because

287
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
A complaint

288
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Is not a legal

289
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
A complaint

290
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,967
Sets out the facts as you assert them or believe them to be true

291
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
And then frames them right Within

292
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Legal counts that says

293
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
If these facts are as they are

294
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,743
Then the law in each of these counts that's compels you to find

295
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
And then you go through

296
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Kind of a two-step process as the

297
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Defense

298
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
The fur

299
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,823
Process that you go through is deciding whether you're going to move to dismiss

300
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
And when you move to dismiss what you say is

301
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Even if these facts are

302
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
100% what you say they are

303
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
This is not a legally sufficient

304
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Ground upon which to sue somebody

305
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
And so get out

306
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
Write the video who gives a s*** stander

307
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,047
That's exactly right the example that I don't know why professors always use this but

308
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
Everybody I know who's ever gone to law school like has

309
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
That their professors use the same example so I'll reiterate it here

310
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
It is the I say

311
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Paragraph number one

312
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,359
A damn frowned at me I could see you doing it right now over Zoom

313
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
Paragraph number 2 that made me super sad

314
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,807
A paragraph 23 therefore I'm suing him for intentional infliction of emotional distress for a million billion dollars

315
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Oh no

316
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
Ed Edd n Eddy would say

317
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
Enter I was not frowning at you this is just

318
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Like what I look like

319
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
Like writing but but when you move to dismiss you if you like

320
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Man even if I frowned at him like

321
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
Browning is not legally sufficient grounds

322
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
4

323
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,543
Intentional infliction of emotional distress my contact has to be extreme and outrageous

324
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
A frown is neither

325
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Extremely outrageous

326
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
F*** off

327
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
And and the courts will say oh yeah we agree f*** off

328
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Right that is

329
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Motion to dismiss granted and you

330
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
We will not move money in your direction

331
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,231
And then if if not

332
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Right and this is where again

333
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
I just went into size

334
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Most cases

335
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Pass that minimal filter

336
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Because

337
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Suppose

338
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
I just Airi erratic that exact same lawsuit and I say

339
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Ghetto vet

340
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Dan

341
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Broke into my house

342
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,295
And slaughtered a rabbit in front of me in the middle of the night

343
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,647
And said if you don't come on knowledge fight him to do the same to you tomorrow

344
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
If your defense is but I didn't do that

345
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
That's not the basis for a motion to

346
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Because if you did in fact

347
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Do that

348
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
And we all know what you

349
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Look look it's hard to book guests

350
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,639
But if you did do that right that would be grounds for unlike the frowning thing be like

351
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Digging into my house at

352
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Murdering a bunny in front of me and threatening me that I'm next that would amount to that standards and still we would proceed to discuss

353
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
And I would be entitled

354
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
To seek documents and information everything else from you

355
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
That would then enable beat approve

356
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
That you did in fact

357
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Sneak into my

358
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Murder the money

359
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,983
And that by the way right it did the through-line

360
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
When you had it was fantastic

361
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
With

362
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
The

363
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Sandy Hook

364
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Plaintiff

365
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:59,295
Alex Jones his failure to turn over those documents in Discovery in the Sandy Hook cases

366
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Is what led to the entry of

367
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,999
So yeah so that's the difference between a motion to dismiss this case is nonsense

368
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Versus

369
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Moving forward with you then adjudicate on summary judgment

370
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Right so take our same thing

371
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
I do get Discovery Discovery is expensive right you have to hire a lawyer you have to put

372
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Documents

373
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,127
Deposition expensive when you don't

374
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,015
Well yeah that's a bad idea

375
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,111
At the end of that process if I still have no evidence

376
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
That you've actually

377
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Come into my house

378
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
W would move

379
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Not to dismiss what you would move for summary judgment

380
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Defense verdict that says

381
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Hey

382
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
You know they did they did a fishing Expedition for 6 months

383
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
And there was Zero evidence that I even know where Andrew lives

384
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,103
Let alone has been in his house I didn't have a bunny that there's nothing

385
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
And at that point if all of that

386
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Judgment in your favor

387
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Could be a bit of a pyrrhic victory

388
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
I just made up the whole bunny thing

389
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
And now I

390
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
You know kind of drunk either drug you through the wringer

391
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Even though you know you did

392
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
That's an endemic problem

393
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
It's probably beyond the scope

394
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
That is

395
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
The complaint doesn't seek

396
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
Took the complete set up a kind of relief

397
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,103
The plaintiffs want right but it is not an operative Motion in it

398
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,455
And so you should not be attaching legal authority to it

399
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
In particular you should not be attaching publicly-available legal Authority

400
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
I thought that was a little much

401
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
That's

402
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,231
That the exhibits all just being like the rules of the Republican conference and

403
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Like

404
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
Cuz I opened it up and it's 130 pages

405
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
I am not reading all of this and then it was only 30 of actual right I was very very thrilled

406
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
That was the case

407
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
See that is the difference between this is 138 like I can't wait to see all the allegation

408
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Star Bakery

409
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
Oh man this is like

410
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
The kid whose fiddled with the margins of his paper to

411
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
To get it out there

412
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Female trouble I want 130 pages

413
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
130 pages cuz I know it's going to be filler

414
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
There's this.

415
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
So-so

416
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
Return to the actual last page

417
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
P29 and and the reason you go there first

418
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,103
And I'm serious as a lawyer I really read when my clients

419
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Get sued

420
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,199
The complaints this way the first turn to the last page

421
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
I see that Alex Jones is represented by

422
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Patterson Smith

423
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Norm pattis alloy

424
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
Norm pattis

425
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
So

426
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,303
So what is the is there a long-standing connection between Norm Patterson and Infowars

427
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703
Yeah he's been he's represented Alex on a number of cases he's been Gaston

428
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Infowars

429
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
When

430
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
Particularly when he wanted to put a million-dollar bounty on the Connecticut

431
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Lawyer Chris Maddie

432
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,759
Norm was actually sitting next to Alex when he did that

433
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,391
He wasn't he what he did there represent Alex in the Sandy Hook case in Connecticut for a bit

434
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
Around

435
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
It's been at least a few years

436
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
He's been in play

437
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,120
That's interesting right because what I do is

438
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
I go to the law firm's webpage

439
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
When I go to Patterson Law Firm. Com

440
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,312
It is Blaze and over-the-top

441
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Connecticut criminal defense lawyer

442

CT

445
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Don't know why you would

446
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Second

447
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Do you need a Connecticut criminal lawyer

448
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
New Haven Connecticut Connecticut criminal lawyer Norm pattis

449
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,792
Blah blah blah found it the Patterson Smith Law Firm to aggressively fight for your rights and freedom

450
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816

00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Capital murder

455
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Connecticut sex offenders

Theft fraud and other offenses Criminal Appeals Federal appeals and misdemeanors including tuid

458
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
And I look at that and go

459
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
That's not somebody who

460
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
You hired

461
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
To sue the United States

462
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
You know to sue a committee of of the United States House of Representatives

463
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
Talk to Norm

464
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
I think he is probably good at those those forms of law but there's ever was discussed in terms of

465
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,600
Like Alex he always calls him one of the foremost

466
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
First amendment constitutional law professor

467
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,976
Lawyers in the country

468
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Then I'm sure that's true

469
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
That may or may not be true

470
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,936
But but I will give you the following B

471
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,752
Of effect as far as approaching

472
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
The first is

473
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Alex Jones

474
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
And Infowars

475
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Is is nowhere to be found

476
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
You wouldn't put that there either

477
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
That's just good business

478
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
I certainly wouldn't

479
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
But when I go to

480
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Types of cases it says

481
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
Criminal defense police misconduct

482
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Whistleblower claims

483
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
And then

484
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
High-conflict

485
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Sybil

486
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
Okay well maybe this is a icon flexible

487
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,984
When you click on high-conflict civil

488
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,336
It takes you to a page that says that has a single red bar that says

489
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,200
Details coming soon.

490
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
How like a Robert Barnes was one of Alex's big constitutional lawyers

491
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,792
The website the America Law Center or whatever he was trying to start

492
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,376
And one of the big pages in it was about his case that he was

493
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Doing

494
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Like he was putting it out there front-and-center

495
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Yeah

496
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
If

497
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,408
If you have represented a an individual in suing the house

498
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
House of Representatives

499
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,040
That is unless you don't want to get those kinds of cases

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
That's the kind of thing you put on your website of your like C

501
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
I do this kind of work

502
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:33,536
Work all the time like if this case were to go anywhere this is a career kind of case

503
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,120
Alex is suing the House of Representatives

504
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
And

505
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,520
Spoiler alert one of the things he wants is to recognize

506
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,360
A b b January 6th committee has no legal basis

507
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
Horse the dissolving of the committee

508
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Yes yeah

509
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,856
Add so that that is right at all of this is to say look like

510
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
What are the dirty little secrets of

511
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
About being a lawyer is

512
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
You can come out

513
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,096
Of a doomed lawsuit looking pretty good for yourself riding like

514
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
You know if

515
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,448
Your client may not ultimately get what they want

516
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,032
But you know if you did a super competent job

517
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
Advancing the arguments as much as possible Right like

518
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
You know you would

519
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
You would still list you would list

520
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Field representative

521
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
On a similar Larry always want to have wins

522
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,208
Example of something

523
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
I do

524
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,096
Chalon in in in government

525
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
I will do

526
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
Hot challenges B

527
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
What we called did

528
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
And that is

529
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Contract put up for bids

530
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
And you know that the the

531
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
One company that wins

532
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
You know my client came in second and

533
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
I get that seem kind of fish

534
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
And you take a look at

535
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
You look at him and go

536
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
Yeah okay but as it so happens that you know the

537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,072
The director of the company that one is married to somebody who's on the

538
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Approval

539
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
Yeah exactly

540
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,960
And I tell my clients right

541
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
You know that

542
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Bid protest

543
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Reversal

544
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
Incredibly rare

545
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,712
Right like you you lose eight out of ten nine out of ten of

546
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
And so

547
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
Have a 500 record in bid protest case

548
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
And that's pretty good

549
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:40,256
Right and left good batting average

550
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
That that

551
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
Just not seem to be

552
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168

00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
Maybe he just didn't

555
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,664
Guy lately but he giant ponytail

556
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,736
And then he grew huge beard to

557
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,344
Far be it for me to critique driving a big beard but he looks insane

558
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Did the other big covid beard

559
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Once once my

560
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Fortunately

561
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,632
Classmate Ted Cruz grew the beard I think the floodgates were he's actually you're ahead of me

562
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
I think that opened the floodgates

563
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Anybody

564
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Ted Cruz can have a

565
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
Beards are cool for the right now

566
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
They're taking a bath

567
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Makes me want to go

568
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
Yeah all the way down

569
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
The skin right

570
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,904
Yeah I would if I if I didn't look like a gigantic baby without it

571
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Without my beard so

572
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
The same thing that I

573
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
I'm scared to take the gigantic baby look

574
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Might be a winner

575
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
The other name that's on here is

576
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
Is Cameron Atkinson which is noted with a

577
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,520
Footnote as mr. Atkinson has submitted an application for admission to

578
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
The farthest Court

579
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
And meets all the requirements for admission he had weights

580
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Admission

581
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
Admission percentage

582
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Was the score

583
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Does not

584
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Say and I cannot find proof

585
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,136
That Mr Atkinson is admitted to any bar anywhere

586
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
He is at most

587
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
2 years out of Law School

588
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
Go get his Law Firm

589
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
When you go to his webpage

590
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Cameron L Atkinson.

591
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,776
It says that he's an associate for Patterson Smith Law Firm

592
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
Connecticut criminal defense lawyers

593
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896
When you go to the Patterson Smith Law Firm in click-on firm attorneys

594
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
He's not there

595
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Again

596
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,856
What I did is I wouldn't to westlie look to see while going to court appearances he's at

597
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
He's had he's had three

598
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
And I hit around for a few years come on

599
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,120
One of them was his failed lawsuit against face

600
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
But back when he was in Lost

601
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Which is how I know

602
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
When

603
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Exact that that he was a

604
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Third-year law student

605
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,224
Is that what that was he was very very mad

606
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
At Facebook

607
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
4

608
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Removing

609
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
Several of his post

610
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Online platform

611
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
And he set up what he thought was this

612
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
Amazing

613
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
Gotcha so

614
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
He

615
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
I'm going to read from the case she says

616
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,960
2019 Atkinson learned that Facebook was Centura censoring post

617
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,800
That mentions the name of the alleged Ukrainian whistleblower

618
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Whose allegations prompted impeached

619
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
By the way

620
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
Yeah that and that was

621
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
In a week

622
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
Figured that name out as well a little do you know

623
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
We're not irresponsible

624
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
So we did not

625
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
That may or yell at like a Rand Paul was doing as I recalled

626
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
Was doing a lot of that like signaling

627
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
To that

628
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,472
Yeah and at look like lettuce boat plugs very brief just how evil that is

629
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,056
That is to to name the Whistleblower is

630
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
An effort to go out and say hey

631
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
You are horde of crazies

632
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Should now harass this

633
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
Like hypothetically intimidate

634
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
People from coming forward to the future

635
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Like there's there's that dynamic

636
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Absolutely

637
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
So

638
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,912
Atkinson decided to test the scope of Facebook censorship himself

639
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
He made three posts on Facebook

640
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Each of which use the name of the alleged whistleblower

641
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
The first to post begin with the phrase test post

642
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,944
One called the individual the hero while the other called the individual a

643
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Dirty lying rat

644
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:50,368
Right to be there he was going to prove that Facebook you know is out there censoring

645
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:55,488
Right-wing because you know blah blah blah

646
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
Yep he's got a control group

647
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,656
Facebook remove both posts without warning or notice

648
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
But not the test post

649
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
I bet he says Atkinson the middle third post still using individuals name but stating that Atkinson had conflicting

650
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
What's on the naming of the alleged whistleblower

651
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Facebook remove the Third

652
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,576
Facebook was just removing every post that used

653
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,952
He he sued Facebook in Connecticut

654
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,024
Facebook moved to remove back

655
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
McKay's

656
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
From Connecticut to the northern dish

657
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
California cancer

658
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Terms of service

659
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Wendy Sue Facebook you have

660
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Sue them

661
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
In the northern

662
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
California

663
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
This is the thing a lawyer should know button

664
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,712
School still figuring it out

665
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,088
Well he was represented by Norman a pedestal

666
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,440
So yes

667
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
You know Norm pattice from from Infowars

668
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
I had to back into him through

669
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Cameron here

670
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
But I'm going to looks like

671
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
He befriended a little buddy that was in law school

672
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
Who's interested in a right-wing shitposting

673
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
AT-AT

674
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
End end that that was worth there was an interview

675
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
If you go to the public appearances

676
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
I have a media

677
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,184
If I were on Infowars wearing a 10-gallon hat

678
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,304
I will probably not post the video that but I am not Cameron

679
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Oh no

680
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,888
May 30th 2020

681
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
He did an interview

682
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
S2

683
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,288
Why covid lockdown measures are unconstitutional

684
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Traditional spoiler alert

685
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,944
But nevertheless I know he has a big hat

686
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Capitalism

687
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
It is official

688
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
It's official photos

689
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Okie dokie Pizza

690
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
He looks like

691
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
8818 age

692
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
Child wearing his dad's suit

693
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
With a with an oversized

694
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
What I look for in a lawyer

695
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Especially like a constitutional lawyer is someone who's not afraid to Peacock

696
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,408
You know like somebody who's got a giant or like Noir with his big ponytail

697
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
Like these are people who are taking bold choices

698
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,600
Well if you like bold choices you will like how Kevin

699
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
SA

700
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,256
A Christian a trial and appellate lawyer Patterson Smith LLC a former business consultant

701
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
A published

702
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
Constitutional scholar

703
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,144
That by the way means that he wrote a law review article

704
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
In law school which

705
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
By the ways of thing that

706
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Most of us do

707
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
And he's he's written the what

708
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Anika published in the

709
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
Marquette University law review

710
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
You know what

711
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
It's a legitimate

712
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Conservative-leaning

713
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
Whatever he did his thing that lost future

714
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,744
That's like the comedy world that's like someone saying that their album debuted at number one on iTunes

715
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:13,888
Generally speaking you can get a couple people to buy your album it's going to take you at number 1

716
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
It's basically everyone has bad credit

717
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
Yeah I did get that something that's a great metaphor

718
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,128
And then it says you got to love this for this is the

719
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,200
Yo ended General Hellraiser witch

720
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
I'm just I'm looking at that hat that ha

721
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
Christian and a hellrazor

722
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
I don't know about this

723
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Admitted that he's been dead

724
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,936
Put on let's put a pin in that one

725
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,312
Evan says he is taking on substantial roles and breathing cases to

726
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
You know and then list the whole bunch of

727
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
End end

728
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,712
I'll be daddy's again that's just lawyer-speak for

729
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
They let me write but they would not let me

730
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
In any event

731
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
This is a there's a child

732
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,096
Episode L now I am armed with the knowledge

733
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
That I need

734
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
To look at

735
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,216
This complaint knowing that it was written by

736
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
A DUI lawyer into chili

737
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
And and I can scroll up to the

738
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Beginning of accounts

739
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
And the counts are the parts

740
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Complaint where

741
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
You list the legal thing that you

742
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
You claim somebody has.

743
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
An end of

744
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Usually right

745
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
You put your strongest one first

746
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
End

747
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
Although you have multiple canister 6-count

748
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
A little bit of a spoiler

749
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
What are the reasons

750
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Multiple accounts

751
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Is that

752
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
You can as a plaintiff

753
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
In a civil suit in the snow shovel

754
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
You can plead in the alternative

755
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
And I will give you a classic example of that if

756
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
If I pay you $500

757
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,624
For the promise that you're going to come by and paint my

758
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
And then you take the money but you never paint

759
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm going to sue you and Mike at 1 will be Bri

760
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
We had a contract

761
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
I give you the five hundred bucks you agreed to come paint my house you never Kim

762
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
You never came by you never painted my house

763
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
But I'm also going to plead in the alternative

764
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
Right I'm going to plead something called unjust enrichment

765
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
I'm going to say

766
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
You know

767
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
It's possible Dan is going to argue he never signed the piece of paper and he thought I meant something else and who knows what

768
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,648
The house is anyway and okay so in the event that the

769
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
It says that there's not a valid

770
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Contracted

771
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
I still want to prove that I gave you $500 and you didn't do anything sort of like a just-in-case kind of thing

772
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
That's exactly right and so

773
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,472
The key part for something to be

774
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
Leaving in the alternative

775
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Route to be a good just

776
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Didn't case

777
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,408
Is that it's based on a different theory of the facts

778
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Then

779
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
The other cow

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,248
And I notice you going

781
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Because

782
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Spoiler as you look through this

783
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,368
Virtually all of these

784
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
Six counts here

785
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Are premised on

786
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
One nonsense argue

787
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:24,864
If I understand correctly it has to do more or less with like hey they can't do this

788
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
And I will tell you that

789
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
Donald Trump and his cronies

790
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Have been making the

791
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,152
Congress can't ask about stuff

792
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Argument

793
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
4 years

794
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Dates back to

795
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
Congress subpoena

796
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Where is Jack's return

797
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
And the argument

798
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
But the argument is

799
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
That what Congress has the

800
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
The power to do

801
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Who is to

802
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Investigate

803
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Things

804
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
For the purpose of

805
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Writing few

806
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
What they don't have the power to do

807
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Is invest

808
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Navigate empress

809
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
You cry that's an executive

810
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
It belongs to the Department of Justice

811
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
That is a true statement of law

812
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,784
But the problem is right that the response back to that is

813
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
Lots of things that

814
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Produce crimes

815
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
AR

816
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
The kinds of things that Congress would

817
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Want to know

818
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
In order to write

819
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
New legislation

820
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
There's that one another election

821
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah we would want to know for example how did you evade our existing laws

822
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Which

823
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,312
Existing laws did you break and by the way there was nothing to

824
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
To prevent

825
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Congress when they uncover criminal information

826
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
From making a referral over

827
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,784
Hey this is summer job but

828
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
That's pretty normal

829
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah it is

830
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
Totally normal

831
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
And that by the way is what happened in the mieszerski

832
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,048
Trump said you don't really want this to write legislation you want this to try and punish me

833
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
For you no criminal Behavior

834
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
And in Congress

835
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Replied

836
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
We can do Tuesday

837
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:10,592
We don't we don't want it to show your criminal Behavior

838
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
But what we want to do is

839
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Pass laws like

840
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
I don't know

841
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Figure out

842
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
What kind of

843
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
Mandatory disclosure

844
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Requirements

845
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,416
We ought to have for elected officials

846
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Doesn't have to be a Witch Hunt

847
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,192
And that's exactly right and that's essentially what the Supreme Court said in Mazar

848
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
It was like

849
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
If you have a valid legislative purpose

850
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Is

851
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
Seeking

852
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Potential legislate

853
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Even if you haven't drafted the legislation

854
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
Damn right because you might say we would want to discover the full scope of how people are evading the law

855
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Right now before

856
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Rewrite a new one

857
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,464
You don't have to have Annex

858
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
You just have to have a valid

859
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Legislative

860
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
And so

861
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
All of these recycled arguments that are like

862
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
You're really after Alex Jones because you

863
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
You hate Alex Jones and you want to

864
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Put him behind bars

865
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
Amphitheater responds back to that is so what

866
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
We can hate you for multiple reasons

867
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
We want this information because

868
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,344
That was an Insurrection at the Capitol

869
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
And we would like

870
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
The craft legislation to make sure that doesn't happen again

871
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
And figuring out

872
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
How this happened

873
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Crucial to us

874
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
Figuring out how to do our job

875
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
As legislator

876
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
It feels it feels sort of like

877
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,704
Alex is taking this personally

878
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
As opposed to a positive

879
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,336
Recognizing that there's a work the work that needs to be done by the

880
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
The committee

881
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
Yeah nnn

882
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,992
Again yeah I just I just want you to substitute in

883
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Any other kind of crime right like

884
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,112
If if you went into court and said

885
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:03,232
The only reason that in an officer Smith pulled me over for drinking and driving

886
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Is kissy hates me

887
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
The judge is going to be like right but were you drinking and driving

888
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Me and the dressing to be like

889
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,592
I don't really care whether you know that they like when I

890
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
If you could show you know some kind of improper

891
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Activity

892
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
That's one thing but like

893
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
Saying

894
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
They don't like me

895
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Therefore this process is invalid is

896
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
Not a syllogism that are quartz

897
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,512
Look I recognize their probable cause

898
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,352
Stew have pulled me over but he hates me and that's why you did it

899
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
Berend and that will involve

900
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
You spending a lot of time

901
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Sugar

902
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
SoCal one says that

903
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Did this is a violation

904
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Of Article 1 Section

905
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
1 +

906
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Of the concert

907
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Challenges

908
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
The subpoena Authority

909
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Of

910
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
The Congress

911
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,391
NN. I want to pick up

912
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Number one here

913
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,279
Just because there was a section of the

914
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
Tuition to which you can point

915
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
Does not mean that you

916
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
You have the right to that gives you

917
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
A cause of a

918
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
Action internet

919
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
I was wearing about that questions that I really wanted to ask you

920
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Standing

921
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
To make that kind of a complaint

922
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,295
About like the inner workings internal workings of Congress

923
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
It is not clear to me that he does right okay so as you point out right so this this

924
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
What follows then

925
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
In

926
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Count one

927
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
Is an argument that

928
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
The 16 committee is not

929
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
Dooley compose

930
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
It does not have

931
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
A ranking minority member

932
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,359
There was insufficient

933
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,175
Advise and consent with the

934
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,247
Ranking minority member with Kevin McCarthy when

935
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
If you wanted to staff

936
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Committee with

937
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
You know trolls and lunatics and

938
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:12,255
And I Nancy Pelosi was like I think we will decline to have Jim Jordan on the committee

939
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,327
But not with the stupid

940
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Not that

941
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Panda

942
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
And all of that

943
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
Right is subsumed by the fact that

944
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Again this sites to Article 1

945
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,431
Sections 1 and 8 but the Article 1 Section 5

946
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Clause 2

947
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Of the Constitution

948
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Explicitly States

949
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
That each

950
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,855
Chamber of Commerce of Congress

951
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
Has the right to set its own rules

952
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,231
Right now and this is a longstanding principle Coast

953
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,535
Back to Before the founding of the

954
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Republic right

955
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
It's why the Senate

956
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
Has

957
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,679
You know that the filibuster the closure

958
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Requirements

959
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
And House of Representatives has fixed time it does not rightly

960
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Those

961
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Because each house

962
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Can set their own rules

963
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,967
And part of what each house can set their own rules means is that

964
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,807
You just need an organizing resolution in either the center of the house

965
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
To change those rules

966
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
And that the other house the president the courts

967
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
They don't get a say

968
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,535
Right and so there is I think

969
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
AAA

970
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
A knock-down argument

971
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
And that basically says

972
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
This is

973
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,751
If if you want to bring this kind of loss

974
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
For you to have standing

975
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
You must have been a

976
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
Grief you must have been

977
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
Personally enjoy

978
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
And why

979
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,575
By the Rumpke subpoena that you feel is not cool that's not

980
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Qualifying as being the green

981
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Right because

982
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
That's subpoena

983
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,999
Is within the lawful power of congress

984
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
The person or persons

985
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,119
That have been agreed right away when you say

986
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,703
For example as it says in in

987
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,031
Count one paragraph 70th listing the failure

988
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
And it says

989
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,407
Failing to appoint representative Davis Armstrong and Neil

990
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Troy meals

991
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Richmond from Texas

992
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
To the select committee despite her promise to do so

993
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
That's because

994
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
Kevin McCarthy said none of them would serve

995
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,023
The failure to appoint Davis Armstrong and deals

996
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
The court is going to say will you know who's been injured by this potentially that might have a cause of action would be Davis

997
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Armstrong and Neil

998
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
If Trey Neal's thinks he belongs on the 16

999
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Text committee let him come in here

1000
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,639
An end argument but who on Earth is Alex Jones

1001
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
To come in and go we are

1002
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:43,551
Geranios really should be on those

1003
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,391
He wanted me to take this one for him and see what I can do

1004
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
It it so

1005
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,255
I do not think the one week when we go back

1006
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
2

1007
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
The

1008
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:58,143
Be kind of motion to dismiss motion for summary judgment standard

1009
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
I would be

1010
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Shocked

1011
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
If

1012
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
Count one

1013
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
We're to survive emotion

1014
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,407
I think that the 16 committee is going to say

1015
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Alex Jones you don't have standing

1016
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
To argue

1017
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
Weather

1018
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
This committee was

1019
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Dooley

1020
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Convened

1021
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,695
You don't have standing to argue about the internal processes by the way

1022
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
The court likely does not have standing to adjudicate

1023
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Write like

1024
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
Because that's great

1025
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,775
Stop you've violated the rules right like the house kicks you out

1026
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
You know your your record is not

1027
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Clear to me

1028
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Where

1029
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,991
Your recourse lies even if you are

1030
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
The member who has been expelled

1031
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
It is certainly

1032
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Clear to me that you do not have that

1033
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
Remedy vicariously

1034
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
On behalf of somebody

1035
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
So

1036
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
The argument of

1037
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
This isn't a real committee

1038
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,143
And so therefore none of it

1039
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Subpoenas are real

1040
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
I think is

1041
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Not likely to

1042
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
But what about the second account and if I may quote

1043
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,127
Come on come on

1044
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,503
Oh yeah I think that that makes total sense the way Vapes

1045
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,647
It would be dealt with is even if Alex was somebody who could put forth the lawsuit

1046
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
If this is

1047
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,463
Naughty real committee

1048
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
Then it would be dealt with within the house

1049
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,327
And like Nancy Pelosi would get censored

1050
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
Not forming the committee correctly

1051
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Or something

1052
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,519
Yeah I think that's exactly right

1053
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Because again

1054
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,687
What are the other things just to kind of keep in mind as you know as we move through

1055
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
It is that

1056
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Right now

1057
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,855
The injury that Alex Jones has suffered is

1058
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
Someone has given him a

1059
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,999
And he is required to show up and talk

1060
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Particular date

1061
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
It's tough for him to talk

1062
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
I can do that

1063
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,679
Episode

1064
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,519
As you might imagine right like that that is

1065
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
This contains a whole lot of speculation that after he talks he's going to get arrested

1066
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,479
Got the trying to lock me up

1067
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
But again

1068
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,855
The general standing Doctrine right like it

1069
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,671
Very very clear article 3 of The Constitution

1070
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Courts

1071
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,767
Do not a judicate hypothetical

1072
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,839
There must be a live case or controversy

1073
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
Problem for Alex

1074
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,983
It really is and so look like

1075
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,543
There is some anticipatory

1076
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Behave

1077
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,687
I just want to be clear because you will have lawyers who were listening

1078
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
And you know

1079
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Sometimes there is

1080
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,855
Contact which is imminent which you know the other side has said

1081
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,903
It will take for example B

1082
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,439
The agency phone

1083
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:08,607
When when AT&T says I'm going to turn these over honor before December 5th or on

1084
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
December 15th

1085
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:16,031
Unless you get a court order and you could go in the court on December 10th for the courts I could be like well let's wait till the 15th and see if 8

1086
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,823
AT&T turns

1087
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:24,479
I have a concrete injury when a party is said I

1088
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
I'm going to do this in the future

1089
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
But

1090
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,855
I am worried that the house

1091
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Microphone

1092
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
Fermi over to the doj

1093
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,231
Which then might in turn

1094
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:40,607
Cite me for a misdemeanor right is the kind of chain of inferences that that

1095
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
Acworth going to be like

1096
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Well yeah

1097
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Call us call us back when you get arrested sir

1098
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,799
A better

1099
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
The position to make a claim

1100
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
If he actually got arrested

1101
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
You think he would

1102
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Nightclub

1103
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,015
Which is probably like never will be

1104
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,671
Correct count to is described as violation of the separation of powers contained in the US

1105
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Constitution

1106
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,767
I can not clear that this is a cause of action this is more

1107
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Thing that you know what's it about

1108
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
Principal and put also ironically wouldn't

1109
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,983
If this case went forward violate the separation

1110
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Of the powers

1111
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
Of the Executive MBA judicial

1112
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,871
Burnside the legislative and judicial

1113
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
It is so weird to me

1114
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
That

1115
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,783
Fitbit that the Trump has been making this argument based on separation

1116
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
The powers

1117
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,879
And it is an argument in favor of

1118
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,183
Kind of the unitary executive

1119
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Right it is

1120
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,511
We must have separation of powers and that means

1121
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,071
The defective Branch can do whatever the hell it was

1122
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,423
That is not you know if you seem like the Schoolhouse Rock

1123
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
Videos right like

1124
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,775
That's not really what separation of powers is meant to be about

1125
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,615
Separation of powers is meant to be that the 50 branches of government

1126
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,479
A relatively co-equal branches and so the idea is if the legislature

1127
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
Issues a subpoena

1128
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Wright Vet

1129
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
The

1130
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,391
Executive branch will duly issue right there

1131
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
The sheriff will

1132
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
Carry that subpoena out to where it belongs and that the Judiciary will enforce the subpoena if you do not

1133
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
It is in fact what's subpoena means right

1134
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:26,335
Combat is an adversarial V like parts of the government

1135
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
That seems that seems

1136
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,687
The really tough to be function

1137
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:36,063
Yeah that's right nnn I will tell you again count to just reiterates the

1138
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,367
There's no legislative purpose argue

1139
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
You know we have

1140
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Beaten to death

1141
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
If it's the fact that

1142
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,815
That there is also a criminal component

1143
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
Is not disqualifying

1144
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
They quote

1145
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,911
From the mazars cases

1146
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
And so you know it

1147
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
Acworth is just going to look at

1148
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
This be like

1149
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Under Mazar

1150
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
You have to have valid legislative purpose

1151
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,151
You can say as they do in paragraph none of the

1152
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Pick up 84 quotes

1153
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,831
None of the information sought by the John stabiner the AT&T subpoena will even remotely inform a valid legislate

1154
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,439
Purpose, I'm sorry. Jose is activities pertaining to January 6th

1155
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
2021 Arbor

1156
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Affected by the First Amendment

1157
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,351
Which also provides a corresponding right to privacy in his activities to correct a peaceful in lawful protest

1158
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
About that sentence is nonsense

1159
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,727
But you can say

1160
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
It's not a valid lunch with a purpose

1161
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
But Congress in the responses to be like

1162
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
Figuring out

1163
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,687
How people planned any legal insurrection

1164
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,271
Is absolutely critical to us figuring out how to write lost

1165
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
Anacortes going to be like

1166
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:44,671
And it's such an easy argument to make that like we have

1167
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:50,559
Reason to believe that there's information that you're in possession of that would be relevant to

1168
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,119
Informing this future legislate

1169
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
So

1170
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
Simple of an argument to make

1171
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
He was hanging out with Allie Alexander all over the place

1172
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
That alone is enough

1173
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,943
Retreat that is exactly three in which

1174
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
We have

1175
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
An application areas is it labeled

1176
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,879
Violation of the First Amendment

1177
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,487
And again you will not see it like

1178
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Usually

1179
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
For example

1180
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
The way in which you might typically

1181
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
Speed

1182
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
A broader First Amendment

1183
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
Is

1184
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
You know a section 19

1185
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
83 action against

1186
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,663
State cup that keeps

1187
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,503
Shutting down your outdoor rally

1188
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
In which you are in a lobbying for you

1189
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Occupy Wall Street

1190
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
And so

1191
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
You would say

1192
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
This is a violation of the

1193
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
First Amendment

1194
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Because

1195
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
You have a state actor

1196
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Police

1197
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,679
Who is using their authority to shut us down

1198
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,775
And they're only shutting us down because they don't like our message

1199
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
You know the Young Americans Foundation

1200
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
Gets to hold a rally every other night and they never get

1201
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
That's how you bring these kinds of

1202
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
You identify the state actor that has

1203
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Interfered

1204
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,695
Speech you identify the speech that has been in

1205
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Interfered with

1206
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,767
And then you know you

1207
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
Please discrimination

1208
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
On that basis there's already a problem

1209
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
The globalists

1210
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
I don't know if that's going to fly

1211
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
It isn't right because

1212
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,711
As you look at it right back up 87 says

1213
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,039
That the documents sought by The subpoena include

1214
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,623
All documents pertaining to political protests and

1215
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
When's the Jones attended

1216
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Proceeding and after January

1217
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
Okay you can see why they would want that

1218
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,095
Second Astro Sign if I'll communication methods that he use that are related

1219
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
To the political protests and

1220
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Him to produce.

1221
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Notwithstanding the

1222
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
The grammar of

1223
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,871
Third day that shows to disclose all Financial account

1224
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Pertaining to

1225
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,711
Financial transactions donation speaking fees

1226
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
And other fees the Jones receive

1227
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
A connection with

1228
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
He protested demonstration

1229
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
Stations in the days preceding and

1230
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
After generation

1231
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
This includes Financial

1232
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Cancel

1233
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,047
Forte that reproduce all documentation regarding his trip to Washington d.c.

1234
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,095
Honor about January 526

1235
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
Including his hotel accommodations in

1236
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
Security at again

1237
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,983
I know you know this

1238
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,567
Part of that is there is an allegation

1239
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,615
That Donald Trump maintained

1240
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,199
A war room at the Willard Hotel for

1241
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
For coordinating

1242
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
The

1243
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
126

1244
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:55,903
And so wanting to know if Alex Jones stayed at the Willard Hotel

1245
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,951
Is why they have that hotel

1246
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,791
I mean the white I think they could just go watch his show from the day

1247
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,631
Did you figure that out right right quick

1248
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,703
They do it remember like lawyers will ask

1249
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
Four things that are

1250
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Over-inclusive

1251
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
Particularly if you're going to

1252
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,383
Make a criminal referral

1253
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,455
Write as a lawyer it is easier for me

1254
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,527
To introduce information

1255
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,087
That a party has produced themselves

1256
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
That authenticate

1257
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Right that there's no

1258
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
Question LOL you know you're good

1259
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,767
You know you have we seen Alex Jones do this

1260
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Independent

1261
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,399
You better get together clip to my show that could be anything I don't

1262
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
I have any recollection on that 5 Second

1263
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Are you better than

1264
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
Then we watched him do that in

1265
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Firestone

1266
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,151
And and so

1267
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,711
So that's why you would even if you've got

1268
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Publicly available

1269
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
Clips

1270
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Always better to go

1271
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Sure

1272
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
Right so

1273
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
Trips to DC

1274
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,951
Document city has by fundraising for any the protest

1275
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
69

1276
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,351
You made a mistake of talking about that quite publicly about his

1277
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
Fundraising efforts for the ellipse rally

1278
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,239
But yeah that alone would be like well we need to

1279
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Hear about this

1280
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,639
That's exactly right and when we get to

1281
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
That that the Fifth Amendment

1282
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Claims

1283
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Right that's

1284
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
That's going to be instantly rella

1285
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Because

1286
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
Spoiler alert

1287
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,623
You can

1288
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Leave the 5th

1289
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,975
Much as you want but if you plead the fifth on a subject

1290
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Upon which

1291
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
You have

1292
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,071
Previously either given testimony

1293
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
Or spoken at length in public

1294
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
You've waived

1295
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
You're privileged

1296
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
You cannot

1297
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,335
Selectively and deceptively release

1298
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
The good stuff

1299
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,431
And then when asked questions about it Billy why

1300
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
I claim the fifth

1301
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
Right like you 5th is All or Nothing

1302
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,295
Are you talking about it or you don't

1303
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
You can't defend yourself

1304
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Ryan contextualise thing

1305
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Cat inside of it

1306
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
Yeah that's exactly right

1307
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
The upside is it is

1308
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,815
If you do absolute and end

1309
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,863
@alex jumping and Buena Vista

1310
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
Kind of the initial statement in it

1311
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
It and it remains sort of what I

1312
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
Expected him to do

1313
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
All of this

1314
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
I should I should just bracket

1315
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,639
Alex Jones could just show up before the ones

1316
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
He would get asked the

1317
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
Answer state your name for the record

1318
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
I am Alexandra Jones

1319
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Where do you live

1320
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Baba blah

1321
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
Question number one

1322
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,159
What were you doing on you know

1323
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Xscape

1324
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
Answer

1325
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,047
I decline to answer that question on the grounds and anything I say may tend to incriminate

1326
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
And then dead literally like

1327
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Just ripped

1328
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
That sentence robotic

1329
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:52,799
I assert my Fifth Amendment right to privilege in declined answer that question on the grounds anything I say may tend to incriminate

1330
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,151
For the entirety of the hero

1331
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,711
And he didn't get arrested

1332
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Raped because

1333
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
Because even if your Rodger Stone and Ed Rodger stone is let's be honest about this a cartoon

1334
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
Level supervillain

1335
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,255
She has Richard Nixon tattooed on his back

1336
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,815
True forget about that

1337
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,375
He's the person who who

1338
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,935
Called up a Jerome corsi and said

1339
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:25,567
I need you to do a Frankie five Angels right like the bad guy

1340
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
This is

1341
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
Rodger stone is being

1342
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Shinto the

1343
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:35,039
The rule that you know everyone is the hero in their own story like

1344
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,135
The villain in his own story but like another guy with great hats

1345
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
Can't take that away from him

1346
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,999
I like the I like the pinstripes

1347
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Denver

1348
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Also

1349
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,143
Bruce Lee hit on a friend of

1350
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
Hope Rising

1351
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
But frankly

1352
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,335
But but he was somebody with

1353
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,151
Be the second God

1354
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,735
I could so the bile is creeping up in my throat as I say this but like

1355
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
Who knows how to

1356
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
Manipulate

1357
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Write like

1358
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,159
You you turn over the documents you want to turn over

1359
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,207
You answer

1360
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
You know whatever questions you want

1361
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
To answer

1362
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,095
Including done and Ed by the way like

1363
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,375
You could even start

1364
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:26,495
I have seen it done you could plead the fifth in response to state your name

1365
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,311
Typically the way that

1366
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,103
That that gets done is win

1367
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
Drug dealers file

1368
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
Anonymous tattoo

1369
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Returns

1370
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,783
And one of the reasons

1371
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
You do that is because

1372
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,111
The IRS enforcement mechanisms

1373
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
Are more robust

1374
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
In many cases

1375
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Mechanisms and they have

1376
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
People who understand it and so

1377
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,095
There are I'm given to understand drug dealers who pay taxes

1378
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
What they do is

1379
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,423
They write occupations rugby

1380
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,751
Dealer right Revenue tax source of revenues drug-dealing

1381
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,335
And then on on the list your

1382
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,895
Name say you don't little asterisk

1383
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:09,247
I decline to State my name or social security number on the grounds of anything I'm a Dubai

1384
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
So soaked the point is

1385
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,927
You go in you sit down you take five

1386
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,487
And you just on a quest

1387
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
Buy question basis

1388
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:24,351
Decline dancing on the ground meat endocrine it myself

1389
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
You don't need

1390
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,215
This lawsuit to stop you from doing that you

1391
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
You could do that

1392
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
And you'd be fine

1393
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,079
You want this. AT&T

1394
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
From turning over

1395
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Yourself

1396
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:40,991
Weather's bad but then also you're forgetting about the really crucial element of that is

1397
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,527
Attention

1398
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:47,135
Being able to present yourself as the victim of a gigantic

1399
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
Government-wide conspiracy

1400
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
You know that that's the real reason for this lawsuit

1401
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
It is

1402
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Like

1403
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,863
These allegations here in this

1404
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
It is so I agree with you

1405
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,239
I just got a bringing count 3 to a close right like me

1406
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,055
Alex Jones has kept can point to

1407
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
0

1408
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,383
Aspects in which

1409
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
He has been

1410
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
Retaliated against

1411
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
For freedom of speech

1412
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
Censored unable

1413
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
2

1414
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
YouTube say what

1415
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
He says

1416
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,135
Demonstrable e crazy stuff

1417
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,487
3 hours a day everyday I know cuz I listen to you guys

1418
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
So

1419
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,095
The idea that

1420
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Defendants

1421
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
This is quoting directly from paragraph 91

1422
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:35,007
Defendants seek to probe activities that Jones conducted in his capacity as a journalist

1423
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
What are the things that you could do is

1424
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
Probe activities that people conduct in there

1425
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Fastest turtle

1426
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
That's not

1427
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,783
That's not a fit right like it's not like oh

1428
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,111
The First Amendment super important so you know journalist could break the law

1429
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,951
Yeah you can't kill someone while you're reporting

1430
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
That literally

1431
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
Think about that if

1432
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,839
If a if a member

1433
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
Of the state

1434
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Republican Party

1435
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
In-N-Out

1436
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Connecticut

1437
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
We're nice

1438
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
And you

1439
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
Found a bloody knife

1440
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
In Alex's house

1441
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,503
Right you would then say I want to know all of your interactions

1442
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
Republican party of Connecticut

1443
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,439
That's not a violation of the first amendment in Belle Chasse

1444
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
You're dumb

1445
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:32,095
It just gets this continues to get the super quickly open till

1446
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,655
For which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment

1447
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
Because

1448
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,519
This is again another nonsense count where

1449
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
A remedy already

1450
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:48,735
So this argument is the Fourth Amendment prohibits the defendants from issuing sweeping subpoenas untethered

1451
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
From valid legislative

1452
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:55,135
Already you have remember the you know the whole painting example I gave like

1453
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,695
This is requires you to accept

1454
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,719
The premise

1455
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,767
That there are no valid legit

1456
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:05,375
If you already think there are discount adds nothing to the

1457
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,959
So which one gets knocked down then for is

1458
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,287
Knocked out as well and I think it is

1459
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
I think

1460
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,103
What 12 most of

1461
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
3

1462
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
+ + 4

1463
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,735
Are all contingent on you accepting the argument that

1464
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,527
You know this is just a Witch Hunt

1465
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Carrying out a u

1466
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
A criminal

1467
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
Poorly set up dominoes

1468
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,327
Typically when you have Independent Health you want them to be more than a Domino's with the park

1469
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
Cuz

1470
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:41,727
You look like this happens all the time like in in civil cases you'll go in with 7 count

1471
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:47,359
Flip the other side will move to dismiss all 7 you might lose two or three sir and that's fine

1472
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Dennis just

1473
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,967
You do not want to have to lose your entire case

1474
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,759
Because the core allegation

1475
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,623
Whatever some who am I to tell Norm

1476
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Add a practices job

1477
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:05,791
Delightfully there was also a specific remedy

1478
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
If

1479
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Congress

1480
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Or anybody

1481
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Issues

1482
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,679
An overly Broad

1483
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Or

1484
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
Illegal or unconscious

1485
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,079
2-channel subpoena you can move to quash that subpoena

1486
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,663
You set out your objections

1487
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,199
True that subpoena

1488
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,479
And

1489
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,319
Mitigate that independent

1490
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,647
That is not the okay that is 8

1491
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,719
The way what you do that is you just control left

1492
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Document and you type in the word qua

1493
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
Sometimes

1494
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,607
Delightfully gifts

1495
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,143
Gets ever put in the media's eight

1496
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
Motion to squash switch

1497
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
Which I love butts

1498
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
Squash does not appear because

1499
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
That's not a thing there.

1500
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,175
Count five is the violation of the Fifth Amendment

1501
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
And

1502
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,735
And again

1503
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
Get there if there's a remedy

1504
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,951
There is quash in this in this document

1505
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
Oh

1506
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:12,863
Really oh well it's it's quashing is in the h

1507
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,447
Part of the prayer for relief

1508
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,751
So it is down

1509
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
It it's it's

1510
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
If the relief that they want done

1511
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
But have not asked for help. Setup

1512
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
In the legal sex

1513
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,711
Yes

1514
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
They want

1515
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
The this court to quash the subpoenas

1516
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,391
But the way in which you get the court to quash The subpoena is by moving

1517
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Takuache

1518
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Or

1519
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,767
Pointing that out as relief in the

1520
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
Count that

1521
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
6

1522
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Neither of which app

1523
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,423
It's the fact that this shows up yeah poorly structured

1524
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
Correct

1525
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:54,079
It's the kind of thing that if you were a civil litigator you you might have known to do

1526
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
So

1527
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,711
Yeah then we have it so so let's go back to the

1528
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,503
That the violation of the Fifth Amendment

1529
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Again

1530
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,087
Everything in here right Jones's inform the defendant

1531
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,415
He intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent

1532
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
Okay great

1533
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
Come in and do it on the record

1534
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Right

1535
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,863
They have informed his counsel that they believe they do not believe he can properly assert that

1536
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Okay

1537
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
That's also fart you know what that

1538
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,031
That's a thing that people litigate against all the time and again

1539
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
What you do is

1540
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
You

1541
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
Builddirect

1542
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Toledo

1543
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
What you come in

1544
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
And

1545
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
You sip

1546
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Had to give test

1547
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
And

1548
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
You either answer the

1549
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
Question or you decline to answer in the way that I took

1550
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
And then when it's over

1551
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Brent

1552
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
Then in

1553
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
In a

1554
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
Typical

1555
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,607
Congress can look back and go

1556
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
When I asked you if you know what

1557
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:57,567
What color your shoes were you said I decline to answer on the grounds of that may tend to incriminate me

1558
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
What's a basis for that

1559
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871
Objection

1560
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:03,711
Right

1561
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,015
And you could go into court

1562
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,807
And one of the things that you can do

1563
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
In court

1564
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Helps resolve these

1565
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,927
Is a court can undertake

1566
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
What was called in camera inspection

1567
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
Of

1568
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
Documents

1569
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
Testimony whatever

1570
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
So another words

1571
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,143
Like it if if I have a valid

1572
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Assertion

1573
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
And that is chal

1574
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,567
One of the things that I can prop

1575
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
I can say well

1576
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
I'm going to disclose this

1577
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
To the judge

1578
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
And once I tell the judge

1579
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
The judge will then you know

1580
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
And the judge will

1581
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,855
Be able to look at this and go yeah that is

1582
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
Totally

1583
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
A valid

1584
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
And then keep it confidential without

1585
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
Telling the other side

1586
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
And in fact

1587
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Quartz do this

1588
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
All the time

1589
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Because

1590
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,167
When you have Discovery issue

1591
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,959
Typically the way in which

1592
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
One side will

1593
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
Withhold another document

1594
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,383
Yeah we're not going to give this document to because we think

1595
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
It's covered by attorney-client

1596
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
And

1597
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:11,039
I've lived on this issue I've lost on this issue where I've said

1598
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,111
Okay we want to judge to take a look at

1599
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,743
Because if you didn't have some sort of mechanism for that

1600
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,791
But you couldn't get anything done

1601
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,887
That's exactly what would ever testify to anything

1602
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,703
Go to be pointless

1603
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:35,615
Yeah you would it would either be every time you assert the Fifth Amendment they would say well what are you doing that for and you would have to tell them

1604
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,919
Meaning

1605
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
Poor

1606
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,087
You could just say I plead the fifth sorry and then they would be like oh well we're not allowed to ask why

1607
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:51,231
So you know congratulations right

1608
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,535
Hoist by our own petard

1609
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
And

1610
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,887
Delightfully

1611
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
I just have to say

1612
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,727
Kept out 6

1613
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,751
Use

1614
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,311
The kind of it is is a chef's kiss

1615
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
That's the way it is the

1616
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Does the Whopper thin mint

1617
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
The end of a Gourmand meal

1618
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
It is

1619
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,575
Violation of the stored Communications Act

1620
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,367
18 u.s.c. section

1621
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
2702

1622
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
Stored Communications act provided

1623
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
That a

1624
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,023
Person or entity providing electronica

1625
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Vacation service

1626
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
Switch to the public

1627
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,631
Shall not knowingly divulge to any person or entity

1628
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,191
The contents of a communication while in Elektra

1629
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Public Storage

1630
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,983
By that surface

1631
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,519
And you say nothing like

1632
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,543
Well that

1633
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
Probably make sense

1634
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
I can understand why we would have a law that says

1635
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,759
If you are storing somebody else's

1636
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
No data

1637
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,343
That die you will not publish

1638
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,671
You're probably thinking

1639
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,999
But there are exceptions to that was my first thought

1640
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,351
At one of the reasons he could tell that is because

1641
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,167
The complaint addressed this in a single sentence which says

1642
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,799
None of the exceptions enumerated it 18 USC section 2702 A1

1643
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,151
Maybe because the exceptions are listed

1644
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,687
2701

1645
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
2702 B

1646
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
But it says

1647
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,319
A provider

1648
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Beige Eiffel

1649
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
The contents of a comedic

1650
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
And then

1651
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
It lists

1652
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
All the different ways

1653
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,791
In which you can divulge

1654
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,911
Law enforcement agencies surprise

1655
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,959
And you can have doubled it

1656
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,847
To a governmental entity if the provider in good faith believe sit-in emergency involving danger death

1657
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,663
We're serious serious physical injury to any person

1658
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,503
Requires disclosure without delay of communications related to the mm

1659
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Or

1660
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,391
So by the way like

1661
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
I think that is

1662
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,719
That is probably

1663
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,351
That is that that Criterion is probably met

1664
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,679
And it is important to note

1665
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,983
That that that is

1666
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,055
Independent of the knockdown so

1667
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,335
I'm about to get to

1668
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,871
This is to say

1669
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
Without

1670
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,175
A subpoena

1671
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
AT&T or any of these companies

1672
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,807
Could voluntarily disclose

1673
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,855
Any of this data to the government

1674
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
And say

1675
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
Look in good faith

1676
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
We Believe

1677
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
That there is an emergency

1678
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,023
Involving danger of death

1679
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,559
We're serious physical injury

1680
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
To whip you

1681
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,143
People planned an Insurrection and maybe planning one again

1682
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,519
And we're giving you these records without you asking for it and without their consent

1683
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Now

1684
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
What are the things you might be thinking is

1685
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
What about

1686
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,991
Like where there's a subpoena in the answer to where there's a subpoena is

1687
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,343
Yes as otherwise authorized in this title including section

1688
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
2703

1689
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,951
Which is required disclosure of customer

1690
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,511
Communications are records and it says

1691
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,095
The governmental entity may require a provider of remote Computing Services

1692
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:13,471
To disclose the contents of any wire electronic communication without required notice to the

1693
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,007
Favorite customer

1694
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,591
If the entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures

1695
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,151
Describing the federal rules of criminal procedure

1696
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,199
Or in the case of a state court issued using

1697
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
State board procedures

1698
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:30,879
Or use as an administrative subpoena authorized by federal or state statute for federal estate Gray

1699
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Sure your trials

1700
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
And

1701
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
Of course

1702
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,023
House resolution 503

1703
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,119
Empowers the select committee committee investigating the January 6th

1704
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Attack of the United

1705
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,703
To issue subpoenas

1706
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,263
The chair of the subcommittee this is

1707
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,591
Section 3 subsection c6a

1708
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,919
The chair of the select committee upon consultation the ranking minority member

1709
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:57,247
May order the taking of depositions including pursuant to subpoena

1710
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,551
I member or Council of the subcommittee

1711
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
In the same manner as a standing committee person with two

1712
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
This other

1713
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,207
Another words that was a lot of legal jargon

1714
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
But this law says

1715
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
It's illegal for a

1716
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
A telecommunication

1717
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
Provider to turn over your

1718
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Your private stuff

1719
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,495
Unless they meet any of the requirements

1720
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:24,895
And there were multiple exceptions it very plainly apply that there is the public emergency

1721
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,967
The end of the fact that they'll be complying with a legislatively ballads

1722
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
If I understand correctly

1723
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,831
You have you have a situation here where

1724
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,111
The argument

1725
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:40,511
If it ain't count one essentially is needed to back up the idea that the subpoena to get ATT to turn off

1726
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Over the records

1727
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607
Is not a valid exception to that rule

1728
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
But

1729
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
That's not even necessary

1730
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
Like even if

1731
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:55,359
That wasn't considered an exception to the turning over the records

1732
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
18t cotuit voluntarily

1733
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,247
So that is exactly right so that will not hold up at all

1734
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,783
It will.

1735
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
Remotely holdup

1736
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,903
I don't know who's going to advance that argument

1737
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,463
Given that they can sue AT&T

1738
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:16,095
I mean the house is likely to just Advance the

1739
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
I don't know what you're talking about

1740
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,727
You say it doesn't meet any of the exception

1741
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
But one of the exceptions is

1742
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:29,407
If a governmental entity issues a valid subpoena and by the way we got a house resolution that says

1743
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,687
We can issue subpoenas

1744
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,967
So

1745
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
This is the

1746
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,015
Kind of thing

1747
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,855
That a DUI lawyer searching through the US code

1748
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
Might come across and be like

1749
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
Hey

1750
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,463
They didn't

1751
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
You know divulga

1752
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Communication

1753
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Without asking me

1754
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
I got them

1755
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,935
Activate this is a DUI lawyer / constitutional expert

1756
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
I should have you know

1757
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Hey baby

1758
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,591
It is just

1759
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
Like

1760
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,431
Listing this is

1761
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,295
When you make a mistake of of that kind of level

1762
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Really

1763
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Color

1764
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,415
The rest of your pleading in the eye of

1765
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,999
I thought even

1766
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
Without some of that legal reasoning

1767
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,375
There's a lot of language in there that is really loaded

1768
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,447
There's a lot of like you don't like

1769
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,495
For instance the saying

1770
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,799
Is Liz Cheney even a Republican

1771
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,871
That kind of accusation

1772
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,943
The other Witch Hunt language and stuff and like

1773
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,271
Paragraph in particular was saying that like

1774
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
This

1775
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
Committee is

1776
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:43,903
Just grown out of the failures to impeach Donald Trump

1777
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,207
It seems like

1778
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,255
That's an unearned

1779
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,583
Conclusion to reach and including it in

1780
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
The background

1781
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,143
Of the

1782
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
You're playing Sims

1783
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,263
Shity

1784
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
That's right

1785
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,407
If there's there's a number and

1786
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,455
Ed so I mean you really point out

1787
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Two things

1788
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Step

1789
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Again

1790
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
You know

1791
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
It

1792
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
I bet dick jokes for a live

1793
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,391
Living right left

1794
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,719
But we filed last year

1795
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,999
An amicus

1796
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,791
In the Michael Flynn

1797
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
And

1798
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
I basically

1799
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
Put my firm on hold for two months

1800
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
And

1801
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
And we rode into a dresser

1802
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Particular

1803
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
Part of the law when this was back

1804
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,383
Before Donald Trump had issued.

1805
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
General pardon

1806
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,967
And when he was just trying to get

1807
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Via Bill Barr

1808
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
Trying to

1809
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
End up

1810
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
You would not find the same kind of informal language that I have employed on this podcast Ron open

1811
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,327
How you communicate

1812
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,191
Territories different

1813
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,519
General vocabu you can switch between

1814
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,591
Yeah I think that's a good way of putting it so

1815
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
You know it's so true

1816
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,663
If it's too full

1817
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,455
Versus PlayStation 4

1818
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
This just jumped out to me to write

1819
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:19,135
Paragraph 6 says defendant Elizabeth L Chaney is purportedly a Republican

1820
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,439
Of the US House of Representatives and you'll like

1821
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,863
When you get down to it multiple times

1822
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
And then

1823
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,679
There is right beginning it

1824
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,727
Craft 38 like

1825
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,823
A question exists as to whether defended Cheney is still a member of the Republican Party the

1826
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,383
Wyoming Republican party has expelled her in

1827
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
What

1828
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
The second half

1829
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
The brightest is so

1830
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
So you have the kind of like

1831
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,903
Firebrand language that

1832
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:58,303
Voted for the committee to exist in the first place therefore she didn't show loyalty to

1833
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:03,423
Before 4 right and therefore she is not a Republican or Republican

1834
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,543
Pretending she's pretending to be

1835
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
But

1836
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,383
And that's the second part is that like

1837
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
Beyond kind of being intemperance

1838
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Is the

1839
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Irrelevant

1840
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
Schleich

1841
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,367
Why on Earth would this

1842
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Mater like

1843
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,231
Say she's a bad Republic who the hell cares

1844
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
That this

1845
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
This

1846
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,327
Winning or losing on this point

1847
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Right

1848
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,679
Is is of absolutely no moment to Yorkie

1849
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,495
It seems like just something that could play for like

1850
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Media

1851
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,799
You know they get something that

1852
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,847
Like it's feels like a dunk

1853
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
For them

1854
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,175
Yeah it

1855
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,343
It's hard for me because you know I have waited through on my show the like

1856
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:58,719
64 separate election lawsuits filed by the Kraken lawyer team

1857
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,767
Is Sidney Powell and Howard

1858
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
Kleinhandler end

1859
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,815
And I

1860
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
It was one of the things that I

1861
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Really

1862
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Initiated

1863
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,911
In the sanctions

1864
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
So they the in Michigan

1865
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
That whole team was sang

1866
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
Byland

1867
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
Glorious

1868
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
7 hour

1869
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,248
Grilling of the lawyers

1870
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
Which iWatch

1871
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
Start to finish

1872
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
You know it's just still like

1873
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,904
Better than any

1874
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
I saw also

1875
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
That's your Superman

1876
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,536
It Rialto yeah do that was yeah that was

1877
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,120
The Super Bowl game 7 of the World Series in 00

1878
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Mixed together

1879
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,728
And nnn what was really like

1880
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
Masterful about

1881
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
Was

1882
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Got universe

1883
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,616
Cutting through the b*******

1884
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
The city of

1885
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,920
Detroit hire de

1886
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
Lawyer David

1887
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,992
To kind of be the

1888
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
Turn on

1889
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
That

1890
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
On that sanctions

1891
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
And

1892
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
And he just

1893
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
Expert

1894
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,560
We was able to do things like

1895
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,680
Call the side like the dog whistling that's in their pleadings right like

1896
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
So

1897
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
They're pleading

1898
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
Contained

1899
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
The

1900
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,848
Fraud vitiates everything with a citation 2

1901
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
A case from

1902
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,640
1879

1903
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
End

1904
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
NN it was David think he was like

1905
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,064
I thought it was kind of odd as I was reading through their briefs

1906
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,112
That they would cite to this you know

1907
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:34,464
Fraud vitiates everything in this single like obscure Supreme Court case that

1908
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,048
Isn't relevant that has never been cited before you know in the

1909
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:42,400
The previous history and then I went on the internet and realize like oh

1910
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,936
What they're doing is

1911
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,776
You know copying shitposting from qanon Bright

1912
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:53,920
Attitude dog whistle to their to their constituents and this is additional grounds for why the

1913
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Sanctioned

1914
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
Because they're not acting as lawyers

1915
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,016
They're acting as a

1916
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
Cargo cult of

1917
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
You know using

1918
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,624
Attend legal language

1919
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
2 stirrup

1920
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,696
And rally their followers

1921
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,488
But put them up

1922
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,560
Even pretending to practice law in this court

1923
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,888
And part of what that what made it into

1924
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,216
Not only did that make it into the

1925
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
Order weird

1926
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,520
Sanctions

1927
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,312
But there's a lengthy footnote that

1928
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,104
Enid encouragingly

1929
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
Tri-State bars

1930
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
To disbar all of

1931
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
They should that that mention that

1932
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,600
Sidney Powell is fundraising over at defend the Republic

1933
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,184
On the basis of these hearings them

1934
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,280
Look you know if if that's not enough

1935
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
To tell you

1936
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,352
That that these people are not

1937
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Practicing

1938
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,168
As lawyers in good faith

1939
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Should have that privilege

1940
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,496
I don't know what

1941
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
Antiemetic

1942
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,128
Tecta keep me a little bit of Hope

1943
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,920
For the future Viper

1944
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
Professional well

1945
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,992
A glimmer of something

1946
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
Dark Times

1947
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:10,464
Makes it even more seems like

1948
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,512
Brand of dog whistle kind of thing

1949
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,816
Is that there is like Adam

1950
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,864
Kinzinger is another Republican

1951
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
Who's on the committee

1952
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:25,568
He is a republican wouldn't he then just be like who cares if Liz Cheney isn't a Republican

1953
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,592
He already got them

1954
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:30,176
It is the illustration of how

1955
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
You know

1956
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
Half of the allegation

1957
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
In this Meandering loss

1958
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:38,624
Don't matter even for the things that you were allege

1959
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,952
Probably Stillwood to yell at Congress though.

1960
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
If you're Alice probably cathartic

1961
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,816
Well I think that's right and that's why you know we've

1962
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,352
Because Witnesses

1963
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
Needed the

1964
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Reading the complete

1965
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,216
Play Backwards right because all the things were talking about now

1966
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
Are in the factual and allegation

1967
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
And this is why I read the black

1968
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
Sprite because

1969
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,176
Dead-end is particularly egregious in this case

1970
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
But

1971
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,504
You know it's true in other cases as well like

1972
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
A fact

1973
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
Is not relevant

1974
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,856
In that section

1975
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,416
If it does not line up with the stuff

1976
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,488
They say they're going to prove and give their legal causes of as

1977
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,560
Towards the bottom

1978
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,376
Area

1979
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
That's okay

1980
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,728
I'm going to remember that when I'm reading these in the future

1981
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
Every element

1982
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
That is required

1983
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
Please

1984
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
Of

1985
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
Criminal

1986
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,968
Or if it's a

1987
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
Civil lawsuit

1988
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,272
Rights

1989
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,064
Has to match up with

1990
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
Fact or facts

1991
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
That are asserted in the facts

1992
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,976
What there's nothing to stop a lawyer from lording it up with a whole bunch of others

1993
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,864
I have traditionally read these kind of filings is like I'll start reading through the facts

1994
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,448
And I'll be like, what the f*** this is nonsense

1995
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,496
And then I'll scroll down to the bottom

1996
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
And see what point you're trying to make

1997
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,128
Skip that first part

1998
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
It's just frustrating

1999
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,736
Yeah it it will it will definitely

2000
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,272
Save your blood pressure

2001
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,296
448

2002
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,440
Yeah I thought was really interesting in the background section is it appears that there is admitting

2003
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,304
That they were trying to stop the certification of the Electoral College

2004
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
Saw that too and I wonder if I wonder how

2005
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Interacts with

2006
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
What

2007
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
John Eastman has been try

2008
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,360
Right because we got

2009
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,944
The contents of the Eastman memo which are

2010
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,992
The playbook for the insurrection

2011
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
Right it is

2012
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,320
It says halfpence go down

2013
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,904
Have a friendly Senator Rand Paul Ted Cruz

2014
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
Abject

2015
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:54,048
You don't have pimp say I'm not going to see these delegation so I'm going to throw them all out

2016
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,096
And then you know xy&z Walker

2017
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,400
An easement has tried to walk.

2018
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,936
Backbite by arguing

2019
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,984
Completely disingenuous

2020
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Everywhere

2021
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
He's been

2022
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
Including an egg

2023
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
Utterly

2024
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,408
Uncritical puppy

2025
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,968
Review what look like

2026
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,248
That was a what is

2027
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:17,344
I also put a longer memo out there and you know when I told Pence Direct

2028
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,904
You know of which there's no.

2029
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
Even Tatian no memo and nobody

2030
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,792
I told him directly I didn't think this was a great

2031
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,376
Idea but that Mama was just what if you thought it was a great idea

2032
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:36,032
Here's how that might play out first page of the memo it said whatever you do don't do this

2033
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
Yeah

2034
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,408
Legal memos to my clients where you rip off the

2035
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
The first page says

2036
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,248
For the love of God do not do anything written on the next

2037
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,064
Terrible idea coming terrible idea

2038
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,512
They're saying the Trump supporters

2039
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,656
Got together started protesting the in opposition to the certification of the Electoral College votes

2040
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,448
I meant in paragraph 19

2041
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,032
It's basically a well-known episode happened

2042
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,336
I quotes on January 6th

2043
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:16,992
They were a large group of protesters they enter the US Capitol breach security and disrupted the counting of the Electoral College vote

2044
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:24,928
Connecting the dots between 18 and 19 is the mission of the 1650

2045
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,792
It seems like a bad thing to have him the statement of facts

2046
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
Dissection

2047
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,376
Ino this is why when you answer

2048
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
Complained

2049
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,448
Sometimes you admit the allegation

2050
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,312
I would not submit again I don't think this is going to get to answer States cuz I think

2051
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,336
This is all going to be

2052
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,616
Dismiss

2053
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
Out of hand for life

2054
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:45,920
Understanding

2055
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:47,968
Coherence

2056
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,088
Upstate

2057
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Yeah

2058
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,416
How I wish I lived

2059
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
In the

2060
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Ductulator

2061
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,304
2016 and earlier world before they were her

2062
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,376
The Deep state of now you know that is

2063
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,912
I get to hear that

2064
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,936
Major news

2065
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:11,776
There's so many sundry weirdos that I'm aware of now that

2066
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,104
I had no idea where alive or existed

2067
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,640
Years ago

2068
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
Yes I wish I could

2069
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,200
Time travel my brain back

2070
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,736
Well and

2071
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,784
And thanks to your show I mean

2072
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
It it

2073
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
The

2074
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,928
Until I became aware of what you guys were doing and then

2075
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
Got

2076
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
Suck

2077
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,512
Down the rabbit hole of

2078
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Just

2079
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
Oh okay

2080
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:38,144
The Crazies crazies right

2081
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,496
The it gets it was easy to kind of think of the

2082
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Like

2083
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:47,360
Trump supporting right as an undifferentiated Mass

2084
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,408
As opposed to the sort of lie

2085
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
Loosely help nucleus of

2086
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,576
Of competing and what time

2087
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
The fundamentally

2088
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Contradictory

2089
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,280
We're really all just would have held together by

2090
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
Cult of personality and

2091
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
But but I love it when you expose the

2092
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960
You know

2093
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,752
The ways in which there might be a

2094
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
An uneasy tension

2095
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,944
If I do I just can't get enough I know I know this is unrelated to the that I would give

2096
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
All of it back

2097
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:33,184
If the rest of the world didn't have to be aware of who Allie Alexander is there's no reason for her to be articles about

2098
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,024
Healthy Alexander in Main Street

2099
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:41,120
That's why we had to come on the show window and Owen Shroyer was indicted

2100
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
No one needs to know his name

2101
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,056
I know who knows who the hello it's rare

2102
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:54,432
One more question less there's anything else you wanted to take it to in there

2103
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,064
I feel like we've hit the main points and also that your prediction is

2104
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
Not great

2105
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:07,744
This is the Outlook is not good for this case the 8-ball Outlook not so good

2106
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,560
About

2107
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:15,424
Big question that I had that I have no idea what that is like is there any kind of a punishment

2108
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,704
You can end up getting

2109
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,776
For making a frivolous lawsuit against Congress

2110
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,336
Know that it did get there

2111
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
That's probably for the best

2112
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,200
Cuz it seems like you could end up

2113
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
But like

2114
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,016
Punishing people for

2115
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,832
Well maybe you should punish them for

2116
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
Wasting everyone

2117
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
So

2118
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,928
You know that this is

2119
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
This is part of a of a larger

2120
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Project

2121
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
That that I think

2122
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,840
And it has its roots in the

2123
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
Between

2124
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:51,776
What we called the American system in the European such a butt really have to be like the American system and pretty much everywhere else

2125
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,544
That is

2126
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,336
With which Sonics

2127
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,640
Write our system

2128
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Is the

2129
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Capitalist

2130
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
Free market

2131
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,040
Each side pays their attorneys fees no matter what

2132
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,600
And there are laws

2133
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,136
The Confucius

2134
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
If there are

2135
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
Egregious

2136
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
That confused

2137
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,560
But by and large like

2138
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,376
If I sue you even if I win

2139
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,680
Right I pay my lawyer's fees you pay your loan

2140
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,520
As opposed to other the the

2141
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
European model

2142
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,336
Is largely a

2143
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,104
A loser

2144
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,408
And so

2145
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,432
You know

2146
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,968
There are

2147
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,760
It's been a tough scholarship about this

2148
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
Centennial

2149
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,832
Start thinking about the arguments going back

2150
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,600
Back and forth

2151
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
You know

2152
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,416
How that

2153
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Interacts but

2154
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,512
But one of the things is that that means

2155
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
In the United States

2156
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
We have

2157
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
You were disincentives

2158
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,144
4

2159
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,448
Abusing.

2160
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,056
NN I'm in class

2161
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
You know

2162
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,176
At the risk of being sort of 2

2163
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,480
You know small-c conservative about change

2164
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
Probably a good idea

2165
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:10,112
Right here I can see what I can see what you mean

2166
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:14,464
Part of me was just curious about like if there is like a slap kind of thing

2167
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,792
Look like Nancy Pelosi could hit Alex with a slap suit

2168
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
Yeah no

2169
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:24,192
That is an example

2170
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Full of

2171
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,520
Institute strategic lawsuits

2172
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:32,384
Station their states like California for example that have very very robust

2173
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,712
That that have essentially imposed a process

2174
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
On top

2175
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
Of another

2176
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,784
So what's up

2177
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
In

2178
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,880
Digital Communications

2179
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,160
Bloggers podcast

2180
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,000
That that existing laws

2181
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
We're really

2182
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Not sufficient

2183
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
To protect

2184
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,864
That the balance

2185
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
And the important

2186
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Free and open

2187
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,704
Communication City impose

2188
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,984
A different set of procedures

2189
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:02,080
If you think you have if you if you've been sued

2190
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,896
Right over thing you've said

2191
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Published

2192
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
Published

2193
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,736
Do any of the claw

2194
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,296
Online on a Blog

2195
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
Gunn Auto Parts

2196
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
It is only drink

2197
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:17,184
California then you can go you can invoke kind of December

2198
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
Brit special

2199
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Procedure

2200
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,512
Get it adjudicated quickly

2201
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,816
And potentially get your attorney's fees

2202
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Fees paid for

2203
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,632
So this is an example of

2204
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
Of one of the

2205
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,704
Specific substantiv changes

2206
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,008
But it would be like the way you think about it is like

2207
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,056
That's the proverbial exception

2208
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,896
Yeah that makes sense.

2209
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,176
The Baseline is

2210
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,992
You know ya unless unless somebody

2211
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
Where you can bring

2212
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
The cause of Acts

2213
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
For abusive

2214
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
Is when

2215
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,952
Somebody

2216
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,792
Uses the legal system

2217
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,096
In a way that they that they

2218
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
No

2219
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,400
Is raw

2220
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,448
And I know that

2221
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,496
That seems like a tough distinction but

2222
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
But here's

2223
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,312
The case that I can

2224
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Think of that thing

2225
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,664
Suppose

2226
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,968
I threatened to sue you

2227
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
And then I write up a

2228
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,832
But I don't know but I never asked

2229
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
We filed

2230
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,904
Right because I know

2231
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
It's it's

2232
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
Bullshitz

2233
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,768
But I can't a copy of it

2234
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Process server

2235
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
And

2236
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,864
Tell him to track you down

2237
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,704
And hand it to you and say all right well now you've been served you're going to have to respond

2238
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,496
Or you know you can

2239
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
Pay me $10,000 and I'll

2240
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
That becomes an abusive

2241
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
Surprise

2242
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
Because

2243
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,808
I know I didn't really filed

2244
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
Right

2245
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,904
Like I'm using the legal system

2246
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,952
In a way that I know is

2247
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:59,072
It's Roxy if there was the demand for $10,000 that was just a prank

2248
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
Well if I file the lawsuit I'm perfectly entitled if that's no legal extortion

2249
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,848
Lawsuit

2250
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:14,176
Send it serviced have a big meme guy show up at your

2251
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
At your house

2252
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
And then call you up and be like all right you're going to write us a

2253
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:24,416
Check or you know this lawsuits going forward with the weird lines

2254
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:28,768
You file it legal extortion if you don't ask for money it's a prank

2255
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,048
If you don't file

2256
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:35,424
Again we should emphasize do not take legal advice for this podcast

2257
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,448
Absolutely.

2258
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:44,128
There was one thing that I was thinking about I didn't think that Alex stood any kind of a risk of

2259
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,664
Getting in trouble if you plead the Fifth

2260
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,200
Or even if you produced

2261
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,992
Some documents or whatever

2262
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,808
Play Blake what Rodger stone is doing basically

2263
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:55,392
I got to hold him in criminal contempt

2264
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
And like

2265
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,488
Thrown in prison or something

2266
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,792
But I was wondering

2267
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
I'm getting the sense that this is not

2268
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,144
Likely or even possible

2269
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,448
I was wondering if there was a chance

2270
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,728
B from like

2271
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,520
Putting a suit like this that's

2272
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,544
Frivolous

2273
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,408
Just nonsensical he could f*** around and cause his own criminal contempt

2274
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Chart

2275
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,480
Does that make sense

2276
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,552
Yeah

2277
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,600
So I mean what you would have

2278
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
Have to show is

2279
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,720
That you know that he is materially

2280
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,744
Obstructing

2281
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,792
That the work of the

2282
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,096
End

2283
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,888
And again

2284
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
You know

2285
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,520
It's strange music

2286
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
Right side one of I-10

2287
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Would kick I get that

2288
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:52,480
But that could also be a tough standard to have with any question related to Alex of it being materially UPS truck

2289
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:58,880
Is Elias material any of the information they get from him they can probably get from Ali Alexander

2290
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,440
Any of the other people they've

2291
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,232
Subpoenaed and apparently they can

2292
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,024
AT&T stuff

2293
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,048
With or without it

2294
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,352
Yeah well and that

2295
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:12,192
Debbie this is sort of a good kind of opens a door

2296
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,240
We talked a little bit

2297
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,776
About when you

2298
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
Canon camp

2299
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,848
Take 5

2300
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
Underprivileged

2301
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,944
Right you have a very very good argument

2302
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,248
Because Alex

2303
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:28,576
Gave a play-by-play of his involvement with

2304
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:33,440
Fundraising giving speeches on January 6th telling people to show up

2305
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
Right

2306
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:37,792
I think you have a very good argument

2307
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,584
That he's wave

2308
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,912
If if not

2309
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
The

2310
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,728
Privilege against self-incrimination innocent

2311
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
Tiger tea

2312
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,800
Certainly with respect to specific

2313
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,592
Text subject matter that that you know you can

2314
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:54,176
Play the clip from the show would be like okay right and so

2315
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
What are the ways in which

2316
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
This is my

2317
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Play out

2318
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
If and when outside

2319
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
Show up

2320
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,976
Congressman Raskin for example is

2321
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,792
Very very

2322
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,120
Until I can see

2323
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
Write asking a question

2324
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:19,520
Ghetto mr. Jones we would like to talk to you about

2325
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,312
Your efforts

2326
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
Fundraise

2327
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:23,872
With the

2328
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,896
I-16

2329
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,688
Correction

2330
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,736
Have you

2331
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,016
Raised funds

2332
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,808
In connection with

2333
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,880
Any argument that you know the

2334
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,648
Action was

2335
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,184
Improper

2336
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:43,584
Or you know what I'm after

2337
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,984
Was there a promo code stop the steel that you enter to get 50% off supplement

2338
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
You get him to assert

2339
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:56,128
Fifth Amendment privilege and then you say respectfully

2340
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,152
Jones Avenue

2341
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Play

2342
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:02,528
Ghetto that clip of you know come on down

2343
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,552
Get 50% off

2344
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:08,160
And then now you've set up a really really good Wrecker

2345
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,952
Heard a we come back and say

2346
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,256
With that in mind giving you up already

2347
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,560
Spoken at length in public about the

2348
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:17,376
Serve respectfully what's the basis

2349
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
For your

2350
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:18,912
Asserting

2351
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,472
At your fifth amendment privileges here like that

2352
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,008
That's how I would want to

2353
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
Set that up

2354
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,824
Seems like obitalk

2355
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,688
I just feel like giving how much public statements he's made

2356
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,992
It would work against him

2357
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:33,760
To play the

2358
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,112
So tell me what you'd so tell me what you think

2359
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:44,000
I mean like you said so much about so many topics and in ways that really don't look good

2360
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,584
Without being able to spend them a little bit

2361
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,192
If you please the fifth on things then he is also giving away is ability to

2362
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:55,008
He'll defend himself on some of these subjects if he's

2363
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,032
You know

2364
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,824
Play I'm not going

2365
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,616
That's what like

2366
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
Maybe

2367
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Defend himself

2368
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,016
Answer the question

2369
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
Better than

2370
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,856
Playing something you said in the password

2371
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,464
That makes sense

2372
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,232
If

2373
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,024
You're not thinking about

2374
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,352
Kind of potential criminal charges

2375
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Great Lakes as a lawyer

2376
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,520
God help me I would never be Alex Jones

2377
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,080
Right but but but I'm thinking

2378
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:34,176
Yeah I know what you what you want to do is say nothing on the rec

2379
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
Leave here

2380
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
And then say whatever the hell you want on your double

2381
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,552
Little shop

2382
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,832
And and

2383
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,136
The idea that

2384
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,416
You know yeah

2385
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,744
Is it possible that you could get in like

2386
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,536
You know what good Zinger

2387
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Really

2388
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,864
You know Market something from your appearance

2389
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,632
It is

2390
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,192
A Boy by Sister lawyer would be

2391
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,520
Let's not risk you know potential

2392
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:03,360
Perjury charges criminal contempt 2usc 192 rightly

2393
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:09,760
But let's not run afoul of that in in seeking the the Holy Grail but on the other hand like

2394
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
You know

2395
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,576
I don't know how

2396
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Easy it is

2397
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,392
4

2398
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,184
For Alex Jones lawyers Tucker

2399
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
Corral him

2400
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,024
They certainly all seem to be True Believer

2401
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
Right

2402
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,096
Maybe

2403
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:27,168
Obiano

2404
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
Is

2405
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,216
Opportunist

2406
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:30,752
But

2407
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,592
It is always hard to differentiate opportunistic

2408
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
True belief yeah and then then you ask the question of like what are they True Believers do is it the like philosophic

2409
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
. or is it

2410
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
The Griff

2411
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,088
You know

2412
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,648
Not that becomes a murky area

2413
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,952
Yeah it was City Paulino

2414
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,232
Exactly what she is a trooper

2415
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:55,840
Yeah with the red white and green little bit less so

2416
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,680
Yeah I guess I have one last question alright

2417
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:03,264
There is video of one of Alex's employees

2418
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,104
Walking into the capitol while video recording

2419
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,872
Streaming

2420
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:13,248
And as he's walking through the threshold into the Capitol building on January 6th

2421
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,368
He's giving a a plug for a sale at Infowars store

2422
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,280
It's one of the cameramen

2423
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,584
Who's there

2424
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,120
That looks bad right

2425
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,424
It looks bad

2426
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,216
But but I will say that

2427
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,240
The fact that it's a

2428
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Cameraman

2429
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,824
Right it gives you the opportunity if you're out

2430
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,104
Alex Jones to say

2431
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
You know well that

2432
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,664
Maybe that's just obvious

2433
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
That person

2434
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,712
Never had

2435
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Apparent waraq

2436
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,760
Actual authority to

2437
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,088
To speak on behalf of Infowars LLC

2438
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
You know whatever he

2439
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,928
He's calling his company now remind Kathy plugs

2440
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:57,024
And it sounds kind of silly but like

2441
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,328
That is part of the standard

2442
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,120
Buffalo

2443
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
Uses

2444
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,912
When you

2445
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,728
Hold yourself out as representing an organization is

2446
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,800
Do you say okay well would a

2447
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
Unordinary

2448
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Person

2449
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,128
In that position

2450
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,200
Think that you represent that organization

2451
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
And

2452
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,504
Create some kind of

2453
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,344
I want to see perverse incentives but like

2454
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:28,512
What's the weather the things that Alex Jones will be able to say in his defense is everybody knows Infowars is me

2455
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:32,352
Rights and I will come in and I will

2456
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:37,216
Cut off right other people don't get to do plugs on my show I'm the one who authorizes the

2457
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:37,984
The plugs

2458
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,824
Get out I was thinking about the

2459
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,408
That the hypnotist conman guy with

2460
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,432
The deuce

2461
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:49,504
Ed

2462
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,552
You should have documenting the

2463
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,088
Palpable anger

2464
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,880
Right when he took over giving

2465
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
The plugs and

2466
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,184
Doing the throat

2467
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,792
Commercial

2468
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,352
Yeah seriously right like

2469
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:06,400
This is where you get those kind of moments

2470
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,704
That were you know

2471
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,240
Astonishing right like

2472
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,544
I don't recall if you asked the Young

2473
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
The Sandy Hooks

2474
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,848
Plaintiff lawyers

2475
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:15,872
Question but like

2476
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,688
Everybody around me was

2477
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Raymour astonish

2478
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,528
When Alex Jones you know introduced

2479
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,808
The testimony of like

2480
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:27,136
Well you know this is kind of a character I play on the show

2481
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,952
I don't really mean the stuff that I say and it's all for entertainment

2482
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:36,096
As a lawyer that didn't strike me as odd at all right like that struck me is precisely the kind of thing you would

2483
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,424
So you know you kept

2484
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
He's kind of great

2485
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
Moments where

2486
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,264
The thing that

2487
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
That seems like

2488
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
Make good legal sense

2489
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,104
Maybe it

2490
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,152
You do a p hard disaster but

2491
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,944
But for me is Alex Jones's

2492
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
Lawyer game

2493
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,296
Like I would relish the opportunity to be like

2494
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,832
Yeah I know sorry

2495
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,368
Everybody knows like

2496
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:02,208
That that can't remember like fired 2 days later like you don't

2497
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,000
You do not abuse her

2498
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,792
Plugs for mr. Jones on

2499
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:12,192
It's almost like being his lawyer would be like a challenge round you decide to get fancy

2500
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:16,032
Do it like pull off little arguments

2501
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:21,408
If this universe is a simulation right like an end and I'm the lawyer character

2502
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,480
I feel like I've had the difficulty turned up to

2503
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,248
The hard but

2504
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,576
You know representing Alex Jones wood with ratchet set up to

2505
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:32,416
Yeah that's instant death mode

2506
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:38,816
Joining me on this I really appreciate your insights into the

2507
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
The lawsuit

2508
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
I had to

2509
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,936
Little idea of how flimsy it was

2510
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
I knew it was not good

2511
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,056
Just for my own reading but

2512
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:52,384
You hear you break that break a lot of that down I'm worried

2513
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,920
I'm worried for Alex

2514
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,712
Well that is

2515
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:59,552
Your concern for him is touching season

2516
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,368
Important time for him

2517
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:06,464
Have a pic of the die-hard Christmas

2518
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:11,840
But thank you so much for for having me on the show this is

2519
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,864
Is this a lot of fun

2520
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,144
I

2521
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,728
I love what you guys are doing for any of that.

2522
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,520
You listen to Alex Jones so I don't

2523
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,944
Don't cross to bear but people can check out your fantastic podcast opening arguments

2524
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,248
Where can I find that everywhere

2525
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
Everywhere

2526
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,856
That's pretty easy to find we are at openargs on Twitter

2527
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,160
But yeah you start

2528
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,976
Whatever your podcast vehicle to start typing opening in in

2529
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:45,376
And I think most of the people who was Starbuck yes don't really need any overlap

2530
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,424
Indicting listenership

2531
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,448
That's what's up

2532
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,288
So I think I think we have a lot of lot of s***

2533
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,848
Which is pretty pretty fun

2534
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
Pretty cool love

2535
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,152
