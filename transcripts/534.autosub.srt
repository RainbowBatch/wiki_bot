What is your vibrates

16
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Except for

17
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,128
This month was a little late getting over to the Box

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Because of snow and

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Schedule and stuff but

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
This month we got these slow death hot sauce

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
And

22
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
This is

23
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
This is good

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
It's good this is quite

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
Good yes

26
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,768
Slow. I might die slowly

27
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
It's very hot

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,912
100 also is a Trinidad scorpion pepper

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,056
I like the flavor of that lot

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
Very hot very hot

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
I think you could handle

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Before the show is over might might make things go down a strange path

33
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Pretty good I like it a bit

34
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
Can use it to I could see myself using it for like

35
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
Dipping chicken maybe or

36
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Adding to a sauce

37
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
Kick it up a little

38
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
Maybe I get a baby little meat sauce for the little

39
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,056
Hot sauce in there a little bit of

40
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Marinara together

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640

00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112

My Brightside is the Chris gethard show washer

47
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,704
This show so much and you know I'm a huge fan obviously

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Truly forced him to say nice things about me through the medium of money like some sort of indentured servant

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
I thought your book was in Barnes & Noble

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,552
And we've developed a great friendship

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,904
I've been starting so many projects I've been trying to find something new to like really sing

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
Sync my teeth into

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
And watching the Chris gethard show just that like

54
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
Unfettered creativity of it all he's very inspiring

55
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Don't give up on doing weird s***

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Yeah I know

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,288

Republic

59
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
No no one's watching

60
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
That's why we're

61
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Yeah

62
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
That's something beautiful about it that embracing of like

63
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,392
No we're not trying to get famous or anything it's really it's really interesting to to consider that both

64
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
Chris gethard and Alex Jones grew out of publication

65
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Two people who

66
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,655

The Browns won

70
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,063
Interesting thing to talk about Friday

71
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,327
The judges and the audience will determine whether or not you fully finished

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
The 21 I think you started

73
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Before I finished that's why I stopped I think

74
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727

Pretty much in the Android Studio although maybe it's running on generators

79
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
It's unclear

80
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
Alex is really really mad

81
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Maria Lema Hellyeah

82
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
He has a lot of breakdowns on this episode

83
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
And discuss what he's lying about in order to

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Forget himself in the place where he

85
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Yeah I'll freak out

86
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,007

00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,847
The present is a tenuous

120
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,431
I think that there are some college students who live downstairs

121
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
And

122
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Will text you in

123
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Complain about this every now and again

124
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
I can

125
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
Hear them yell singing through the floor

126
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
Feel like sitting in a wet ass p****

127
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
This sucks

128
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
I'm waiting for you to go to Sawdust

129
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,655
Would get a whole circle in the topic I thought about harappa

130
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Inches away from old manse topic

131
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
But I just can't do it

132
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Feel-Rite knocking on the door cuz

133
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Covid-19

134
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
New Pennywise

135
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Tabroom that's why I'm a little silly but the good news is Alex isn't like totally

136
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Center presents

137
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
Plainfield

138
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
From Today Show

139
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Lawyer

140
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Brother acts so much

141
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
If I were Alex in the position he's in right now I think I probably hate lawyers do

142
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
We should be which is everybody hating on lawyers

143
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
It's been awhile since everybody's really agreed to just hate lawyer

144
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,679
You know what I'm saying

145
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
6park

146
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Lawyers were more of a villain in Jurassic

147
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
The dinosaurs

148
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Exactly that's the whole thing

149
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
Yeah I don't know how is that in a weird state

150
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
So Alex starts the show by talking about how like

151
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Maybe I shouldn't do this

152
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
Which is nice. Always a good sign

153
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
For the show that's about to happen

154
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,375
You know I learned something during the Trump Administration I've never tried to be in LA or being New York

155
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
To be in d.c.

156
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Jimmy

157
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Sycophantic

158
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Pandan in the cyst

159
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
But I noticed very early on they would work around the clock

160
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
To try to make sure

161
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
That is not accessed

162
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
The president

163
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
Accept anybody

164
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Because

165
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Always just thought it

166
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Form the public about things

167
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
And then that would

168
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
Percolate up in the government and in the governance and then we would

169
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
I'll be able to

170
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Against tyranny tripleup lionomics

171
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Take action against the law

172
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
But

173
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
It's about

174
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
It's a balance

175
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
You also need to Target

176
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Obviously people that

177
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Power structure

178
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
I'm almost empty

179
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Now

180
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
With the news I have

181
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
To just not do the shuttle

182
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Probably would be better if I just call Tucker Carlson costume

183
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Steven Crowder

184
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Call Rodger Stone

185
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Can you

186
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
We cover so much hardcore stuff here

187
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,175
We just drop bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb a bomb

188
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
Familiarity breeds contempt

189
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
I get it I have contempt for myself too

190
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Portland

191
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
This is this is an interesting hits

192
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Startling number of words

193
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
For a very simple concept 2

194
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Express

195
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,935
People other people have better reach than I do I think I need to probably

196
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
I could do better

197
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
But it is also like

198
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Really shooting on the audience

199
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Nyjah hub

200
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,759
You guys are so used to me being the best yet even give a s*** how great I am

201
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
Because I'm so good

202
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
I wish I was worse at my job so you guys would have to raise your level if only I killed time most of

203
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
The time exactly

204
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
Also why do you need to get the hold

205
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
The Trump has not spread

206
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
He's the president

207
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
That's very strange

208
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,735
You ever been at a comedy show

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
For whatever reason the host

210
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
It's just like

211
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,879
Their opening set was just something really weird

212
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
And everybody in the audience in all of the comics got the vibe of like

213
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
This going to be a weird show

214
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
It's not going to change

215
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
This just happened

216
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
It doesn't matter that there's an hour and 20 minutes left

217
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Hour-and-a-half it's going to be weird

218
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Exactly

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Whatever B

220
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
I'm hearing right now

221
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Yeah it's a lot

222
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,063
This town of like I don't want to do this anymore

223
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Particularly severe on this episode

224
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Distance makes the heart grow fonder

225
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,119
Broadcast

226
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Eminem

227
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Just because

228
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
This is too important to be smoking

229
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
John

230
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Absolute

231
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Total

232
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Complete

233
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Master plan of the enemy

234
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
We have them

235
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
By the short hairs completely

236
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
And no one is going to care

237
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
It's always the same

238
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,903
Always the same all you listeners I bring light

239
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
I give you all their plans but nothing happens I've got to call Tucker Carlson

240
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Steven Crowder

241
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
I'm going to be on

242
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Athea

243
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
I don't think

244
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Familiarity always

245
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Contempt

246
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Continually starting the show with

247
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
My news is too big for me to do the show is something

248
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
Familiar for me not to

249
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Contemptuous about

250
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,767
Yes yes

251
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Equation

252
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Is it screaming

253
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
I wants to quit

254
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
That's okay

255
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Trudeau

256
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
And to prepare

257
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Because I'm not just going to sit here

258
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Put this information out of this

259
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Today

260
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
Do it

261
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Because we have

262
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
I don't know why people don't have an instinct to Victory

263
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
But it's incredible

264
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
Who was bleeped out season signal and gives a s***

265
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
He's very mad

266
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
I like these pretty mad

267
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:46,015
I do I mean there's something there's something weirdly Noble

268
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
About the tenacity has

269
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Because

270
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
Every other human being I think on the planet what it is certain point go like

271
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Well I've seen every other major news organization release huge information and then change the world

272
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
And I think I've done that literally every day for my entire career and not once have I changed the world

273
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Perhaps it is me

274
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Yeah

275
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Maybe my

276
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:17,759
Radar is busted maybe I can't tell what big news

277
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
Look a little bit harder at the stories I cover

278
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
No no

279
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
It's everybody else's

280
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
The fault forever

281
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
I get so mad

282
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Everyone else's fault

283
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,399
Always really loved about his broadcast-style when he gets in

284
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
These moods is like

285
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
He doesn't

286
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Say what the news is

287
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
Why would it

288
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,479
I enjoy that I enjoy there because it's really the

289
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Patel

290
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
The dishes perform

291
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
On some level

292
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Definitely pissing him off

293
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
It's probably

294
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Ufinancial and maybe

295
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
The staff sucks

296
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Property lawyers

297
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Call Susan Compton

298
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Down. Not doing

299
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
The job that he needs them to do

300
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
But it is not that bad about what this big news is he's clearly still using this bike

301
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
This

302
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Breakdown lashing out as a way of like

303
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Anybody who's watching

304
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,783
Don't tell people that he's spanking quit on air

305
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,623
I'm going to use it in my speech today

306
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
What am I talking about

307
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
What's the big news

308
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,679
At least when I call other people that are influential daycare and I'll look into it but it out

309
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
I called Paul Watson Modesto he's busy on today or something

310
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
I'm at a party right like 5

311
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,199
It's just that I don't have the people

312
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
The keys to the

313
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
Lucifer

314
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Nails done

315
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,951
Power Paul I would not appreciate Alex talks about him

316
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Received

317
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Unprofessional

318
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,167
Weird weird to have to work with that guy

319
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,007
It's almost like he lashes out at the people around him as well as the audience

320
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
On a constant basis

321
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Yeah

322
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Like he's a child

323
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Almost

324
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Get to the big news

325
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Alex

326
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Let it rip

327
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
What the story is

328
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
And it is

329
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Bulshit

330
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
It's

331
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
You understand, we have

332
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Smoking Gun

333
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Of what did the power outage

334
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
100% was the department of energy

335
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
And their order

336
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Keep the power off

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Unbelievable

338
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,735
Kimberly so many Smoking Gun so much proof

339
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:02,623
Hong Kong

340
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Running giant death camps

341
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
America

342
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Then enjoy it

343
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:19,007
I want to watch to take somebody

344
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,503
Power

345
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
Tip of the spear

346
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
But it's a setback I'm still going to leave

347
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
31

348
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
All this emotional outbursts

349
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
In this childish

350
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,359
But he still able to say freaking he still able to recognize he's on the radio

351
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Define

352
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Little Falls

353
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,759
Alex is very mad about a document

354
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
From the Department of energy

355
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,255
He claims that its smoking-gun evidence that the power outages and Texas were intentional which is why he's putting on this shamefully child

356
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
Display a fake

357
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Start the show

358
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
We'll get into the documents as Alex covers it

359
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
But at this point let me just some things up to say that Alex

360
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
What is entirely wrong about

361
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
That's not hard

362
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
It's not hard to believe

363
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:29,919
If no but it does it does the level to which he's wrong about it makes all this out verse really really funny

364
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
About all of this

365
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Is

366
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
There is

367
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
And you can't deny that being your own boss is great

368
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,183
Right sir

369
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Exactly like

370
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
That kind of a

371
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
You just get that if you work

372
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
For someone else

373
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
Wolf blitzer's not going on TV on Election night being like

374
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
I don't even know what the results are I quit

375
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Let's let's imagine that Alex

376
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Did have a boss but he had such a good contract that you couldn't get him out of it like firing him would require paying out 10

377
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
And years of his contract if he yelled I quit on air and I was about to be like you said it

378
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Your letter of resignation

379
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
That the other good thing about. Having a boss

380
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
This is a Smoking Gun

381
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Sure

382
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Isn't The Smoking Gun and then there's another there's so many

383
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Alex

384
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,407
Smoking Gun stuff

385
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
And then I've got a bunch of other

386
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Big giant smoking

387
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Guns

388
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
I am too damn angry to do this broadcast right now

389
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
Other stuff going on so

390
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
I do find my stack of those from yesterday I got to do a lot of stuff around here

391
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
I want somebody walking on my taxes

392
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,871
But I don't even bitching anymore I just can't do this 67

393
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Public White Zombie

394
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
It's like walking into globalism

395
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Because people are unconscious

396
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Stop watching TV and playing on their phones

397
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
That's the problem

398
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
The public

399
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Yeah

400
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
He's having a bad day

401
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
You know I can't help but feel like I've been there before I work comforts me

402
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
All the time

403
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Is when I

404
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Just go oh no I'm just an a******

405
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Everybody else is asleep and I'm just being a dick my bad guys have an a******

406
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Having a bad day

407
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Be out somebody

408
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,976
I got to overcharged for something and maybe I'm taking it out on the people around me sometimes

409
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,560
Honestly I'm sorry you tell them and they're like

410
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
Eyeball berbere happens

411
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Central piece of his Showmanship

412
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
Dwelling in that place

413
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Having a bad day

414
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
And that means everyone's got to die

415
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Unconscious

416
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm watching TV and playing on their phones

417
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,536
Kill Everybody

418
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Use Neutron bombs at least The Killing

419
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,704
He's right

420
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
Neutron bomb in the public

421
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
Neutron bomb

422
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Mom

423
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
Do you know anything about Neutron

424
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Start over

425
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Yo Gotti

426
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Bill Gates

427
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Pledge allegiance

428
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Do it

429
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
She wants to run something

430
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
The devil

431
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
Of course I'm serious.

432
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Rappers

433
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
Department of energy

434
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,920
So anyways I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while I'm trying to settle down

435
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
And then

436
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm going to come back and lay all this out for you

437
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Incredible

438
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
What was it a display

439
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
That was a show

440
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
That was a baby

441
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
It would really suck if his conspiracies were actually true

442
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,544
Movement about

443
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
Book The imagined like

444
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Having to fall in line behind

445
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
Brutal brutal little a******

446
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,904
You know you know who goes down in history for being a hero people who is weathering

447
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
Adversity you know when you think of Nelson Mandela you think of being put

448
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Prison for all those years

449
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,144
Not just surviving through it but then going on to help

450
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
Found f****** country for a real

451
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,288
Opportunity and equality you at you at his speech

452
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
Okay

453
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
25 years and I don't even know if I want to help any

454
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,368
Don't give a s*** about me

455
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,208
Bishop Desmond Tutu is an a******

456
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Yeah yeah

457
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
That's who I want to

458
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,216
Following our noble noble leader

459
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
This document was available

460
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
Before I could have been covering the story

461
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
It this way before it's ready at the

462
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,344
Sort of childish it was the windmills narrative and what have you

463
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Before I live on air

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
I got a bunch of extra news that I would already

465
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Was told

466
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
Buy a very close

467
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Perceptive

468
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
I dropped the ball on

469
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Monday and just bought

470
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Controlled by

471
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Texas Powerball

472
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
That the feds order the map to increase power

473
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
I should have followed up on that

474
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
I should have gotten

475
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
I should have found out

476
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Will let me see the director

477
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Just went for another glass of wine

478
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
In the dark

479
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
And then son-of-a-b****

480
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
A whistleblower inside apartment of Energy contact

481
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Someone that works here and said why is Jones not covering that no one else is

482
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,592
20 minutes from when on air

483
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
Website

484
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
And it was like being

485
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
Punched in the chest on the stomach over

486
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
And over again

487
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,088
For sure they raped us for sure there.

488
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
It's written

489
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
What is wrong with this man

490
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
I don't know

491
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,896
I'm not sure exactly what the definition of slimy documents are but I guess for Alex

492
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
The opposite of what you needed to say so you have to argue when they say yes they really mean no

493
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:09,696
Super slimey

494
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Whistleblower to loosely

495
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
Publicly available document

496
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Department of energy website

497
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Hipster if anything

498
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,216
Maybe somebody's doing Alex's work for him

499
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
Been to that websites not a whistle

500
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:28,384
The document in question is titled order number 20 2-2 1-1

501
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
It's four pages long so there's no way I believe Alex Reddit

502
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,088
It's really easy to find if you go to do find what your reason order

503
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,928
That is the increase the electrical Pasadena Texas power grid in order to

504
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
To deal with the emerge

505
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
And see that the state is going

506
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
February 14th

507
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Violetta

508
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Reliability Council of Texas an independent system operator who service territory includes 90% of the electric customers in the state

509
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,776
Taxes filed a request for emergency order under Section

510
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
Can 202c

511
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Of the federal power app

512
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
The beginning of the document lays out how I had foreseen the possible issue and this weather event is expect

513
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Exit to result and record winter electricity demand

514
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
That will exceed even ercot

515
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Most extreme seasonal load 4K

516
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,304
To try to adjust for this ercot attempted to maximize energy Generation by doing things like Avenue Railroad Commission

517
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,376
Texas put out an emergency order that quote specified

518
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,960
Increasing the priority of gas supplies to ercot generator

519
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,616
What are the main things of this order is about is that the electricity generation that they were needing to engaging

520
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,920
Would almost certainly not be possible quote

521
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,760
Without violating Federal air quality or other permit limitation

522
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,112
Caught appeal to the Department of energy to get an order allowing them to work

523
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Outside those regulations

524
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
Due to the emergency situation

525
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
The order it says quote

526
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Given the emergency nature of the expected loads

527
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:56,448
Stress the responsibility of our cots to ensure maximum reliability on its system in the ability of our got to

528
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,056
Identify and dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load

529
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,664
I am determined that the additional dispatch of the specified resources is necessary

530
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
The best meet the emergency

531
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
And serve the public interest for purposes

532
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Of f p a section

533
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
I'm 202c

534
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Okay so the

535
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,952
Document Alex Jones the saying is them saying you can't have more power is them saying

536
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Yes you can have more power

537
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,328
With some limitations destroy the Earth

538
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Right

539
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:31,008
The order is the acting Secretary of Energy replying to ercot saying that they have permission to break regulations up to a point

540
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Do you order literally says quote

541
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Anticipate

542
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
The disorder may result in exceedance of admissions

543
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
As well as Wastewater release limit

544
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,832
To minimize adverse environmental impacts disorder limits operation of dispatched units to be

545
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:49,696
Three times and within the parameters determined by our cot for reliability purposes

546
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
It's pretty simple

547
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
This is just an order where I asked for permission to wiggle around some regulation in order to be able to meet the increased

548
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Command of the energy emergency

549
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
The department of energy do so but that wiggle room only existed for the purposes of re-establishing reliability of the power

550
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
They couldn't just pull out all federal pollution regulations

551
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,552
Somebody less rigidly enforced given the human need that existed

552
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,392
Me too. So let's find a better place then let a way to make this work

553
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
There's nothing here

554
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
It doesn't sound like it just why I was doing this High School drama club club play about a serious and Smoking Gun

555
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Dollars

556
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
It's actually a document that says the opposite of what he claims it doesn't because that is the case he has to claim that it's that ime

557
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
This is the level of work that he's doing and it really makes you wonder why he doesn't

558
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Like it's B

559
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
This is nothing

560
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
I don't know

561
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Cuz he's his own boss

562
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,808
Slimy

563
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
I don't think he's even read it so I don't I wouldn't

564
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
Expect him to understand some of these like dynamic

565
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Texting all of this

566
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Yeah

567
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
I think he realizes like I don't know if I can really even

568
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
So I can explain this to the audience in a way

569
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
It's going to make them

570
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
Motivated

571
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Call Tucker

572
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
And tell them to look into this and let them break it I don't care

573
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,480
And then affected stay at the audience

574
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
Great but I say so much. People

575
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
Alex just said no it's not

576
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,696
Whatever happened to plan B ever saw

577
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
Robert Duvall in network

578
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
Canada

579
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,936
Okay

580
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Bad

581
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
And then I sit there and I read

582
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
That works in these damn plants

583
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
To go

584
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Power

585
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Thunder

586
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
The freaking federal government

587
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
Because put them back under the son-of-a-b**** two weeks ago

588
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
That we all knew that

589
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
Man you know I here's my pic

590
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Search for Alex

591
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Anime this is going to sound crazy

592
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
But he's sick of being under the backs of sure Bill Gates

593
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Warren Buffett

594
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
Ted Turner for some reason

595
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
Join the Socialist buddy we want to try and get rid of these rich people and remove their power come on man

596
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
How can you get rid of them let's go

597
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
Socialists are working for Ted Turner

598
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,592
They just don't know it

599
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
Ted Turner

600
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
Here's my cell back to you Alec

601
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
Ted Turner think

602
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
We're working

603
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Looking for him

604
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
But we're actually working for our own goals

605
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Using his money and power that he thinks he bought us

606
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,304
Another possibility would be moved to

607
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Okay that's also a good one

608
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Alex UK

609
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
Can also go to Antarctica

610
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
So

611
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,056
What are the features of Alex's coverage of this document from the Department of energy

612
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:22,432
What up what are the strategies uses alive I call it making things up

613
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
And guess what

614
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
Under federal law you'll be processed

615
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Executed

616
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Unless you exhaust

617
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,440
Outside power supplies first

618
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
There's no mention of process

619
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Execution

620
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
The relevant part of the order that Alex is talking about is as follows

621
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
Consistent with good utility practice ercot shell exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources including

622
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Mobile Imports

623
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Demand response and identified

624
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Behind-the-meter generation

625
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Resources

626
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Selected to minimize increasing Amisha

627
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,784
To the extent that such resources Provide support to maintain grid reliability

628
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Prior to dispatching be specified resource

629
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,208
This makes total sense a story about it to make things seem more nefarious

630
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
When in reality

631
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
This is very much a document that is the Department of energy giving ercot a fair amount of leeway and trying to keep the system online

632
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,728
Frequently other document you see it made clear that if a determination

633
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,056
Of what is necessary is that they need to put on more

634
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,640
Hi live now

635
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,016
The determination of when it's necessary to put on Galvez other things

636
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
That's at the discretion of

637
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
That is not that's that's left up to them

638
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Interlaken

639
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
Behind the meter generation resources for what it's worth is like

640
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Solar

641
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
And batteries

642
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
And stuff like that

643
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
I got

644
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
I just don't say

645
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
I don't I don't see I don't see what he saying

646
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Compelling

647
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,152
Texas always have their power supply before Obama came in

648
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,968
The states all around

649
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
How much is a country

650
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
The US under Trump got to where it was the biggest supplier of energy in the world for

651
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Orthodontist

652
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
Again this is just something Alex is making up

653
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,816
The power grid in Texas specifically exist in such a way as to not supply power to other states

654
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Avoid Interstate energy sales regulation

655
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Kim from the federal government

656
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,008
Someone super 10 Persona that Alex has should really understand that Dynamic Weiland

657
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Be proud of that

658
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
Also Alex is just reporting something Trump lied about

659
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
I'm pretending it's real

660
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:33,760
Trump basically lied in his State of the Union speech about how for the first time in 65 years with net exporters of energy

661
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Prices

662
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
FirstEnergy

663
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
You're going up so well yeah I imagine so

664
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Warriors

665
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Texas Wholesale Electric price

666
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
Thousand percent of made out of

667
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
And what is this little sweet.

668
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Bring up next

669
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,776
They had the first only buy from outside sources

670
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Including available import

671
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Demand response

672
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
Is it raining

673
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,272
Outside power when you don't have enough

674
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
Imports

675
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Either a lawyer term

676
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:18,560
Once again that was just an economics term

677
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,192
Demand response according to Alex's lawyer speak

678
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,496
I mean you got to buy outside power

679
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
He knows this because he looked it up

680
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
Yeah this is made up out of thin air

681
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
Responses and energy-efficiency strategy that involves giving customers the ability to adjust their electricity usage

682
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
Play from peak hours by doing things like

683
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,880
Offering cut rates at other times when the burden on the electric rate is lower

684
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,184
For putting small Terrace on power during

685
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Repeat.

686
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,024
Energy documentary saying that in addition

687
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Using available Reserves

688
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,424
Demand response strategies should be employed where possible to maintain the functioning of the power grid

689
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Oh so you mean incentivizing

690
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,056
People to spread out the usage of power

691
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,408
I'm fairly certain that you did just say by all your power

692
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Sure

693
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,992
It would be easy for someone to hear me make

694
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,136
This correction of Alex and say that I'm just nitpicking and fact-checking him pointlessly but there's a really serious phenomenon that I'm trying to illustrate

695
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Alex Jones

696
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Constantly pretends

697
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
No thanks

698
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,328
He has a consistent pattern of just making up definitions of words and details about new stories

699
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
And then pretending at the thing he's making up his

700
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
Is the product of researcher

701
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Navigation

702
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,544
He's important to recognize that he does this about the small details of his day-to-day conspiracies

703
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
In the same way he does with the larger worldview level

704
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Conspiracies

705
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
He's workflows essentially like walking

706
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,528
Watching a shity improv show rooted and terrible racist politics

707
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,136
Uses headlines and words he skims and stories as the suggestions

708
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
From the audience

709
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
But it takes money rips a scene out of

710
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,024
I would implore anyone who takes him seriously to consider that dynamic

711
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Critically engage with the things he say

712
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,144
You'll almost always find him fabricating details about

713
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
The stories that he's covering

714
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
In order to make them fit is predetermined narrative and worldview

715
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,312
Would you absolutely wouldn't need to do if he wasn't full of s***

716
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,224
As for the skyrocketing prices of energy some consumers are seeing that is being reported in reputable outlets and it does appear that

717
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Get some of this is going on

718
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
The Public Utility Commission of Texas is opening in a dress

719
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Navigation to the possible price gouging

720
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
And I would guess that if they find companies that were engaging in that

721
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,256
Then the customers will not be responsible for paying those outrageous rates

722
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
Was one thing to keep in mind however

723
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,400
Small number of people in Texas use a company called greedy

724
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,984
To provide their electricity which operates on wholesale prices

725
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,800
Most people use providers who have fixed rate

726
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
But going through company like gritty

727
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
Actually seems people money on their electric bill General

728
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
The downside is in a situation like this

729
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Their rates are not

730
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
And making Skyrock

731
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
Even so I would guess that these people won't be stuck

732
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
With these exorbitant Bells

733
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
The solution will be read

734
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
I know I just I find it hard to believe

735
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Better

736
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
I don't know

737
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,936
It's just at this point in time it's safer to assume that people are

738
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Going to get

739
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
F***** over and some

740
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Massive fat

741
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,872
Possibly possibly but I would I would guess that's there will be some

742
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Forgiveness

743
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Yeah

744
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,040
The examples that you see or these like really really high bills

745
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
And the ones that I've been able to see and someone could correct me if I'm wrong

746
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,928
But the ones that I've been able to find being reported

747
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:31,840
Are wholesale prices, which are not the majority of electric users

748
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Most likely

749
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Fixed rate

750
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
And there

751
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,704
Obviously their prices will go up to but

752
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,104
But not per like the right

753
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
But they won't

754
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
That's just a natural phenomenon

755
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Uno

756
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
W

757
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Do price gouging is illegal

758
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Satellite

759
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
At the bottom

760
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
Alex

761
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
You know he's got this.

762
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
Document that he's lying about

763
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,888
Yes I feel really excited about this lies he's pretty pumped about it

764
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
And

765
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
You know what

766
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
F****** people in Congress

767
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
In Texas

768
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
And our governor

769
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,640
We need to lie about this document to Ono

770
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
And all

771
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,224
Ted Cruz

772
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
I'm self

773
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
All Jon Cornish to do is come out

774
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Game over

775
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
By the way

776
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
Going out to get a cheeseburger

777
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
45

778
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
His daughters were going down there

779
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,264
Watching people down there with his daughter to get out of the cell

780
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
His power was off

781
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Just came back today

782
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
Facebook

783
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,528
Now your grass cool Mexico

784
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
We go down there but I'm not even defending

785
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
How old is Bethany

786
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
He horrible

787
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
And the Democrats are all look he doesn't care about you

788
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,960
Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones masterclass and intentionally missing the point

789
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
Yep yep yep

790
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Remarkable

791
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,848
I could very easily be made that he doesn't

792
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
See that is something very difficult

793
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
To do because he too is

794
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
Could I could have something to do with that

795
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,112
Those things were rich people really understand why poor people get mad

796
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Yeah

797
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,488
It's a really interesting way that Alex engages with Ted Cruz

798
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,840
Responsibilities as an elected official as opposed

799
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,144
To the responsibilities of other

800
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
Anime

801
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
You know it's weird

802
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Need to be there.

803
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
Sure

804
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
So Alex is mad

805
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
Now I should say that he doesn't know that it's the elect

806
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
Reliability Council of Texas

807
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Really know what it is he doesn't

808
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,647
He seems to think that her cot is like basically Enron

809
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Oh okay

810
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
What company

811
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
I'm just reading it

812
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Me so angry

813
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,007
Almost turn the desktop or seriously man that's a normal response

814
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Learning

815
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,335
Just robbing our future they're blaming us

816
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,151
They're starving people

817
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,687
Killed over 50 people

818
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,271
They're going to rape us more and her telling is permanent

819
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Blackouts because the feds

820
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Put bots in control

821
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Feds put her cotton

822
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
Control has no idea what that is supposed to be

823
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Texas power grid

824
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:51,007
Which is run by a board of directors that's overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas

825
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
And the state's legislature

826
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,639
The public utility commissioner is responsible for overseeing ercot or

827
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Berkeley appointed by Texas's governor

828
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:04,063
There could almost be no system imaginable where the state would have more direct control over the power system

829
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Other than one worthy state

830
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Itself runs all the

831
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Power plant itself

832
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,999
Which I can't imagine Alex advocating for no no

833
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Alex knows nothing about the sub

834
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,607
Dixie's covering a story to tell the audience

835
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
The shows larger themes and narrative

836
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Jason reality at all

837
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Outrageous

838
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
Also you don't get to

839
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,919
He doesn't get the care you already did the coronavirus thing where you denied all of that s*** do you don't get to be like

840
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Oh how dare they do this now.

841
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
It's a remarkable how everything is

842
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Conspiracy

843
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Alex

844
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
Get back to this document and this is kind of

845
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
I just wanted the other reasons I'm in a nice mood

846
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
I'll be on Deezer to slap happiness and sleep

847
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,607
Deprived

848
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,191
Grounded

849
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
In the ercot region

850
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
Texas the generating units specified resources

851
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Order pertains to are listed on the order

852
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
202 Dash 21-1

853
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Resource list as described below

854
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,807
And it's all hydroelectric

855
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,855
It takes him a week to turn to call plant

856
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
Sandwiches reading this

857
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Part of the doctor

858
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Methodist giving

859
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
Her to come as no surprise but he's just making s*** up

860
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,631
The resource list that's referenced in that department of energy order is available

861
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
And it's easy to fall

862
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,007
It's just a list of power generation plants in Texas that are relevant to the order

863
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,615
Each plan is listed in the third column in the spreadsheet is the type of energy

864
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Thank you okay

865
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
Literally zero are solar windmills or Hydro like

866
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Because that's not what the order pertains to doesn't seem like those would be important

867
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,719
Killer one either all natural gas lignite bituminous coal or distillate

868
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
Fuel oil power generator

869
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Wichita

870
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,839
Are being given special permission to operate in ways that would

871
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
The environmental rules

872
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,471
Specifically only when doing so would be needed to maintain the reliability of the grid

873
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,055
Alex hasn't read the actual document nor has he seen this resource

874
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:05,663
He's literally just making up what he thinks the story is then repeating that to his audience as a fact

875
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
That's what

876
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Yeah it makes up stories

877
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
The story tell

878
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Also

879
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
This should make it

880
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
More than abundance leak

881
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
Clear

882
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,975
We have an order saying that these evil power companies

883
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
These can destroy the Earth in order to save lives but

884
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,863
All the renewable energies are just like a you guys keep on

885
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
Like it seems it seems very obvious that

886
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:33,567
One of these is a serious polluter destroying the world and the other one there like okay well you guys

887
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
So Alex

888
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Is really

889
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Confused

890
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
About

891
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
And what have you and the

892
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
The federal government

893
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Charge

894
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Man lot of

895
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Confused as to how this happen

896
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
It's a really really bad

897
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
Control

898
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
Wouldn't let him out the power

899
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,519
And unlimited what they can do

900
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
I'm not sure that's

901
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
What's happening

902
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Fairly certain that I have heard many,

903
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,631
Comments on Biden's ability to

904
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
From what I've heard

905
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
Some people like it

906
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:37,823
Some people don't just about Borden totally clear I got kind of like texting bashing that

907
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
What's going on

908
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
I think is wrong

909
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,199
I think it's misguided and at least

910
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
Civic Center that is going on

911
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
I don't know

912
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
What extent

913
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,647
It is not really been exposed to much of it myself sure

914
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,231
I imagine if I spent more time on Twitter maybe I would have seen

915
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
Some dumb comments

916
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
But whatever

917
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,655
That's said Alex is doing is trying to take criticism

918
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Memes about Texas

919
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
Their power grid is operated

920
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,567
How many turns that into people saying the Texans just walkie hall-dale

921
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Opossum

922
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,639
He doesn't have a response to the argument about

923
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,223
The great because he doesn't actually even understand the conversation the people are having

924
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Not a little bit

925
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,599
He can get his audience personally offended if he makes the whole thing about how the coastal Beats

926
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
Fake people in the middle of the country or stupid

927
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
That's pretty much the tax

928
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
Activate ucpn employed here

929
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Infuriating

930
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
I do not appreciate

931
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
That he is talking about

932
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Problem

933
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,423
That is almost entirely the result of a state

934
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
Desiring more than anything else

935
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
For the federal government

936
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
To get out of there f****** business

937
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
And then

938
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
To blame the

939
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Beds for being in their business

940
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Yeah I mean I think

941
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Think I think

942
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,319
I think that there's a piece of it that you can probably blame

943
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
On the organizational structure

944
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,719
The disconnection from the interstate.

945
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,511
But also like I I think

946
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,119
You also have to be very careful with that because of how severe the storm is like

947
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,959
Even an ideal circumstances there would have been power outage

948
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Like 100%

949
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,079
Perhaps not to the extent that it it going to we have seen

950
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,383
And maybe not as severe as we've seen

951
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
But

952
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:21,247
The storm like that in Texas is something that is just a recipe for

953
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,551
There's going to be a lot of trouble

954
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
I'm just saying that if the reports

955
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,439
Of them being that close to having no power for a month

956
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
Right

957
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
That is 100%

958
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Look

959
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
They're going to be power outage

960
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,399
They happen here they happen everywhere and

961
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
Dealt with if you ever assist

962
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
That is like

963
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,847
Well we were a James Bond moment away from f******

964
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
Never having power for the next

965
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
Year

966
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,015
Yeah you're done f***** up in the planning somewhere along the line

967
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,343
It's really tough to say if that problem

968
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
Is

969
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
Essentially related to

970
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
The non-interstate

971
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,303
Energy sales

972
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Just

973
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
Unrelated mismanagement or something

974
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,983
I don't know enough to say for sure but I think that those things are important

975
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
The peas out

976
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Make too much of a judgement

977
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
But it does seem like

978
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,615
Whatever it is it something

979
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
I mean

980
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
At the very least it would be hard to imagine

981
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,087
If there was some sort of unified or

982
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Greater

983
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
Area of

984
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,719
Power control where it would be able to be

985
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
Transported it effectively much much better

986
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,655
To the point where they we would have a better response time at the very least

987
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
You know it maybe now

988
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
But who knows

989
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
For now all we do know

990
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Is that Alec

991
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
Over-prepared

992
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
For his shift

993
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Massively prepare for the show

994
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
I have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12

995
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
1314

996
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
15/16 stacks

997
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
That was impressive in red

998
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
Can't believe you counted all the way up to 16

999
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Coming up

1000
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
No

1001
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:21,823
Department of energy override Trump's executive orders until Texas

1002
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,111
I just wanted to see this all over the news I want to see them go to prison

1003
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Go bad news

1004
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Country travel

1005
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Good luck buddy

1006
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Personally offended because this is about Texas

1007
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Yeah

1008
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Do you want to know is

1009
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
The Texas

1010
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,471
What about you

1011
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
I am looking straight on

1012
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Ritonavir

1013
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
Texas

1014
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
Those people take

1015
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,479
And Alex might have the worst example

1016
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
There's some mistake

1017
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
This

1018
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Texas

1019
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
Think of us take off down here

1020
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,183
Peopleready

1021
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
I'm just saying what

1022
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
With a lot

1023
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Fire

1024
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,911
Because they're stupid

1025
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,495
No idea

1026
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
People

1027
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,055
Dedicated

1028
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Dedicated

1029
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Is there family

1030
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
God

1031
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,199
Who defended it

1032
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Why did you say

1033
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,831
Look texting in the Texans will f****** kill the president will do it right

1034
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
F****** mouth

1035
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,159
That's weird I thought it was right

1036
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Now

1037
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
GasBuddy

1038
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
There's one thing I know about the South if that

1039
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,119
They murdered president said

1040
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
Conspiracy I guess

1041
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,239
Had to been a Texan

1042
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
This is interesting. The mob is not the Russians it was not a single load actor it was the Lone Star State

1043
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
George h.w. Bush

1044
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
I don't know you think it's a coincidence

1045
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
I don't think it is

1046
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
I don't think it's not

1047
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
Cruz's dad

1048
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Alex Jones

1049
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
Exactly the Magic Bullet was actually a exploding to situation

1050
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
Calling card

1051
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,087
So Alex Goes to College

1052
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
And not a lot of these are

1053
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,647
Worth even

1054
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Mentioning

1055
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,023
Although I will say that this next call is probably the saddest

1056
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,583
I've been listening to Alex

1057
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
In a long time

1058
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Hellboy

1059
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
With my free

1060
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,191
Free kids I live close to the memorial

This whole thing and

1062
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Just want to say thank you to you guys.

1063
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Because there is not

1064
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
I would have gotten

1065
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Brutus

1066
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,687

A victim

1075

Weed

1076

John the boom operator said

1103
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,575
Doesn't matter geology blow up earlier that's real looking for red blood

1104
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
Oh my God

1105
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Boy

00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
Wow

1107
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
Just bought me out so much

1108
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
Check everything that dude was saying is so wrong

1109
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Just

1110
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
Brutal

1111
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:34,239
That is that's just uncomfortable conversation I don't know but that is just

1112
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
Enumerated a crime

1113
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,871
Like what he is just described is somebody soda

1114
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
Destroying his mind

1115
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,479
He is in thrall to the point of death

1116
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,783
Buju bbid

1117
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,319
TriNet disaster

1118
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,647
This is one of the situations where

1119
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Some of Alex's

1120
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:57,279
Product actually probably be quite useful like

1121
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
I bought a water filter

1122
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,615
The idea that in a disaster in this in this scenario that he's in he goes to the generator to

1123
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,919
To try and find Alex's videos

1124
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,247
Keep his connection with humanity and God

1125
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Is just dark

1126
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Yeah that is

1127
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
The dark thought

1128
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
That is a dark thought

1129
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
Especially when like okay your connection to humanity

1130
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
Just quit earlier this year

1131
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
Humanity

1132
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
This guy

1133
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,375
Bill Gates your neutron bomb everybody

1134
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:38,239
I mean it just it just makes you feel like you think about all the horrible ship

1135
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
The tap into the past new like why would

1136
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
People follow that guy anyway

1137
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,151
People follow me over there

1138
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:49,247
The expression they used to say in Missouri was it takes all kinds

1139
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,575
So

1140
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
Why would anyone listen to a thirteen-year-old pope

1141
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,951
And then you get that guy and you're like wow yeah I guess

1142
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
Believe whatever you want man

1143
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,815
About this thirteen-year-old Pope

1144
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
Is that the young Pope

1145
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,239
Was that HBO show that was that was what

1146
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,335
Is he the type who told his audience to prepare kill list

1147
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,407
Yeah actually was I believe you

1148
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
Ladies and gentlemen

1149
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,039
Describe to you how serious times are know you are

1150
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,391
I'm not saying these are cuz I will be misconstrued

1151
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
People would go after just minions I don't

1152
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
They don't

1153
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Out

1154
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
The globalist

1155
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
People Bill Gates control need to know

1156
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
They need to know

1157
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
What they're doing

1158
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,175
God is going to hold them accountable where I pray for God

1159
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Are they coming

1160
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
Address that we reserve the right to

1161
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
He said threatening late

1162
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
I'm out.

1163
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,511
We are in the military

1164
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
I just I can

1165
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Sit there

1166
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
And lie to you and tell you that you're not

1167
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
And so

1168
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,703
Santa Claus

1169
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Researching

1170
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Naughty but nice

1171
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
Polar sausage

1172
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Going to get little

1173
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
Circular toys

1174
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
So that's where we are

1175
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,319
Ryback stay with us your call Zach redhead

1176
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,903
Alex talks a lot about this idea of making kill list

1177
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,487
And like I don't know I don't know anything but

1178
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
I could see somebody

1179
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
Trying to kill Bill Gates or

1180
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Something

1181
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
And then being like

1182
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:48,799
I was advised that he was trying to kill everyone with a vaccine and that we

1183
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
We needed it was

1184
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
Defensive really

1185
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
WhatsApp told you that

1186
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,223
Alex Jones everyday simply

1187
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
Every

1188
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,551
I don't know if it's like

1189
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
The kind of thing that you could get in trouble for illegally booths

1190
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
Spiritually or or just

1191
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,951
Morally

1192
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
He's doing everything

1193
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
Zach Woods

1194
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Lead someone to

1195
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
Do the thing

1196
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Just a thing hasn't happened

1197
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,935
Yeah I would I would just

1198
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,775
Say that it's time to write a sequel to Miracle on 34th Street

1199
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
Where Alex claim

1200
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
Santa is making

1201
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,639
Kill list out of this naughty and nice list

1202
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,199
We all know timilai papers

1203
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,759
It's a no I'm sent

1204
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
Unreal

1205
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
All we know you're f***

1206
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,927
Getting real. You're killing all of our children are going around

1207
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:42,303
Elves know so blood red

1208
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
People

1209
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
Oklahoma

1210
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Power

1211
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
Freezing

1212
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
And dirt

1213
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,831
National Basketball Association teams

1214
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
And

1215
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Play their basketball

1216
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,023
Game

1217
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Nicole

1218
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,375
Technocracy is if they go oh

1219
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
Downtown Austin stays open

1220
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
For 6 days

1221
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,591
Do some of the places they were taking power during the Texas storm seems a little bit

1222
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:30,687
Strange but a lot of it's actually really easy to understand if you take the time to

1223
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Care

1224
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:35,295
A lot of it has to do with sections of the grid where essential Services relocate

1225
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,599
I'd like hospitals being a higher priority

1226
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
The ones that say didn't

1227
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Kentucky hospital

1228
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:46,047
This could easily create the impression that there was power in downtown Austin but not in outlying areas

1229
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,655
But if you look at the proximity of downtown to not only the Capitol building but also

1230
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,447
Dell Seton Medical Center

1231
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,495
All kinds of warming centers

1232
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
And st. David's Medical Center

1233
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
You start to understand how it might be impossible

1234
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,663
To retain power to those buildings that also keeping power on

1235
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,711
For some 6th Street businesses

1236
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,015
Then maybe you like why are they why do they have a light

1237
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Also

1238
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,623
It appears that you do correctly understand why would people are mad at 10

1239
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:15,231
Ted Cruz is the basketball being played but people learned

1240
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:21,631
Oru flying to Mexico but people are depicted to be fair I would guess a similar

1241
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:27,007
Things going on in Oklahoma city where the Thunder play at the Chesapeake Energy Arena

1242
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,823
Which is within walking distance of the County Courthouse

1243
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,895
The County Detention Center and Saint Anthony Hospital

1244
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,991
As well as the entire University of Oklahoma Medical Center complex

1245
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,319
Including the Children's Hospital in the VA

1246
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
Said that everybody needs

1247
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
Two separate Palladium

1248
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,511
It's pretty simple explanation I just don't I don't understand why people

1249
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,303
Mad or confused about things

1250
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Games that are like they're pretty easy to

1251
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
Understand because it would be

1252
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Fine

1253
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,703
So Alex has Mac

1254
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,751
Text Kaiser on and they just talked about 2

1255
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
Bitcoin

1256
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
It's really mad about how

1257
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
He could have bought Bitcoin when it was like

1258
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,015
$5 and now it's over fifty Grand well the thing is or whatever it is

1259
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,855
Max 10 years ago offered him 10,000 Bitcoin

1260
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:20,767
And the Alex

1261
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
Hey buddy how are you might have missed the boat around

1262
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,775
Who gives a sheds to talk about how great

1263
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,359
Stop giving out your web address makes it sound like you're a sponsor

1264
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,479
How much

1265
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,271
Bitcoin will be worth now

1266
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,063
Kiser's Lake

1267
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,927
So kind of joke about that's why you got to sell these bumper

1268
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,511
It was really nice

1269
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
Let's guys are his freedom

1270
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
Alexa is

1271
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,143
Kind of enjoyable but it also makes

1272
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,471
His interviews not really all that worthwhile for our show

1273
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
But after he leaves

1274
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Joel skousen

1275
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
Symptoms

1276
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,639
Joel skousen

1277
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
Amass

1278
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Yeah he is

1279
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
Hey weirdo

1280
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,503
And I just have forklift

1281
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,551
Wisconsin's interview

1282
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,159
That are four reasons why you should not take Joel skousen series

1283
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
The first

1284
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Is that

1285
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:28,351
He also along with Alex seems to think that ercot is at like a federal agency or a company

1286
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
I want to set themselves up as a savior

1287
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,983
I think it's important that you Groove me the other shows

1288
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,799
Federal mismanagement control with

1289
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,383
Removing the state from the process that took one of our backs Power Systems

1290
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,759
No

1291
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Probably Federal

1292
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
21

1293
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,879
Didn't you correct him if you know

1294
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
That air cot is a Texas

1295
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Pacific

1296
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
If you understand the Dynamics

1297
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
Play you shouldn't

1298
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,911
Go along with Alex saying a literally the opposite I completely agree with your dinner

1299
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:07,519
What it is that he saying is 100%

1300
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
2

1301
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,919
Go ahead and listen to anything the drill has to say about the the storm and the power grid

1302
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
If he doesn't know this

1303
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
Basic

1304
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,551
Yeah that would be a problem I don't think I would want to learn

1305
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
From somebody who doesn't know algebra

1306
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,903
Now here's where it gets weird

1307
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,487
Reason number two not to take Joel skousen.

1308
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,863
Where do you think of fossil fuels and oil

1309
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
No

1310
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
Personally

1311
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,823
I think it comes from God and you put them there about ten thousand years ago.

1312
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
Petroleum geologist

1313
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
Oil is not fun

1314
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
Fossil-fuel what is it

1315
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
Well

1316
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm afraid I have to get theological here this was part of the creation of the Earth

1317
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:59,231
Oh my God

1318
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,583
Fossil fuels exist if you create a boil

1319
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:09,215
From deteriorating animals look at all of the trillions and trillions and trillions of tons of oil

1320
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
Which would only represent

1321
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,359
Tiny fraction of the decaying bodies of any designer stores

1322
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:20,735
You would have had the dinosaurs 100 ft deep over the entire Earth plants

1323
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Marine life

1324
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,039
Wow dude

1325
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:27,903
This is not

1326
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
Carbon only comes from old dinosaurs

1327
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Thank God

1328
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
But he was making the Earth put oil down there

1329
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,143
I swear to God I swear.

1330
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,727
I don't know if this is really a narcissistic

1331
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:45,311
And I'm going to go ahead and buy thing I don't actually believe it

1332
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
It's kind of fun to think about

1333
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
I felt a little bit of resistance

1334
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,991
On Joel skousen part to say that I'm hoping

1335
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Is it be like God dammit

1336
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Make fun of it

1337
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Answer the question I have to go

1338
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,815
Okay so do things that God put oil down there for us

1339
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
2

1340
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
22 you a reason not to take him

1341
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,983
All too seriously suppose that look

1342
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
Religion

1343
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Whatever

1344
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
But you can't do that

1345
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,639
You know like a demonstrable ridiculous

1346
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Thing you can't just

1347
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,271
Like I said you can

1348
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
You're more than free

1349
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:35,231
To believe whatever you want to believe however it will implicate how I view your believes in

1350
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,559
No I would like that to be true as well

1351
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
Fortunately that is

1352
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
Not true for most

1353
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
Sure

1354
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,215
If you want to believe

1355
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Jegs

1356
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Like

1357
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,079
That God put oil in the middle of the world

1358
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:55,455
I think it's harmless belief unless you're using that to argue against climate change

1359
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:00,575
Belief that God put oil down there for us to use

1360
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
How do you say to inform

1361
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,719
My view of your arguments about anthropogenic

1362
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,839
Sure I just I would just prefer if we had to if there if

1363
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,143
Holy books now have to have footnote

1364
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
That's my new rule

1365
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,471
If something is demonstrable e true

1366
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
It's a footnote in your book

1367
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,335
I get it

1368
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Is that from

1369
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,503
I swear to God if it is I kill myself

1370
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,831
Any other segment called new rules

1371
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,719
What's the joke

1372
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:44,863
Turn into fossil fuel

1373
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,959
Speed below-ground fossils come from

1374
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
God no

1375
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
I don't

1376
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
You know what f***

1377
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Samson

1378
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,455
Every whenever you pulled the temple down he made all the father

1379
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Was

1380
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
Intelligently designed

1381
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,647
Exactly

1382
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,975
I'm you know I'm not even sure that

1383
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
You know desire

1384
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,863
Those actually lived on the Earth

1385
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,703
Is very very possible this Earth was created by Mayors from other previous

1386
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
Planet Smoothie sings our previously Groening

1387
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
And put together

1388
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Oh boy

1389
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
This is some this

1390
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,663
Camelot

1391
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,759
To be honest like I knew that Joel skousen was a bit of like

1392
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Yes I'm weird

1393
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
Beliefs

1394
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,111
Gelatos like

1395
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,207
He comes from his his family anti-communist roiled

1396
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:47,583
Everything is a f****** false-flag to him he is not

1397
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,607
But this is

1398
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,423
This is out of my

1399
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,543
Itself was a false flag from other planet

1400
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,359
That's it could be

1401
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Coupons

1402
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,223
Other planets with themselves

1403
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Well okay

1404
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Spaceman

1405
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
So I will admit that there are millions of people who've dedicated their entire lives to studying and understanding what

1406
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Fossils are

1407
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
And I couldn't listen to anyone of them

1408
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:24,703
However they look weird to me than those people do so guess what

1409
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
Space

1410
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,519
God

1411
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,567
Understand about all those who will study fossils

1412
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
It's all a scam

1413
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,383
Do you study fossils

1414
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
Cuz if you did

1415
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,223
You would get into it and then someone will come

1416
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,271
Put your put your arm around you'll be like listen

1417
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,903
For scamming people with all this

1418
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,535
That's why it's Indiana Jones was so cool he knew it was all a scam that was predicted program

1419
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,375
Perfect grip steal it from the thuggee cult

1420
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
Yeah

1421
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,055
I guess fossils coming from space is going to be another reason I'm not going to take Joel skousen too seriously

1422
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:05,663
Now I think you might also believe in Divine Alchemy of some sort

1423
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,455
This is this is also kind of weird

1424
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
You know when you look at the chance

1425
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:14,623
This orbit of this Earth being so perfectly designed in the

1426
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
The perfect season

1427
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
And you're in the middle of an inventory

1428
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,399
Things Can Happen by chance this

1429
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Northwest

1430
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,215
A design Divine creation

1431
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
And you know

1432
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:37,151
Most Christians believe in and it should all believe in the fact that the Lord has power over the until

1433
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:43,807
Over the elements meaning the elements are in Cheddar's

1434
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,367
No

1435
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:51,487
The most Shelter Rock and water poured out

1436
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,679
Necessary

1437
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
Small image of God

1438
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
We'll be right back

1439
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Way that way to throw to break that

1440
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:09,919
That is a thought process that I appreciate if God can command the element

1441
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,319
Then the elements must be smart enough to know I didn't think of that

1442
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,135
I didn't think that the Elementals could also

1443
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Obey

1444
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,927
Or disobey

1445
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
Commands

1446
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
I guess Lee

1447
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,071
The Staggering unlikelihood

1448
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
Of life

1449
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
Leeds 12

1450
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,215
Beside arbitrarily that it must be

1451
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,775
Fully designed and also the Bible is literal

1452
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,639
Yeah how could how could we have such a perfect environment a perfect planet

1453
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,247
Massive weather events are occurring almost regularly due to our faults where

1454
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,575
People are being destroyed over and over and over again

1455
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,855
Because

1456
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:55,743
They get a perfect amount of water where the problem I'm guessing is it weren't burning enough

1457
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,559
Oil well carvings good for the planet is what I was

1458
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,375
That's what I'm hearing carbon dioxide

1459
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
Starved

1460
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,959
Damn where's my buddy Mark Moreno at when you beat

1461
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,519
Dude is strange

1462
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,591
Yeah

1463
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
Euro much weirder dude then I think

1464
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,247
I can kind of see why you normally stick to

1465
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Weird geopolitics

1466
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
As opposed to some of these

1467
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,135
Yeah more esoteric beliefs cuz they're

1468
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Very strange

1469
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,255
They kind of make you look like a Project Camelot person

1470
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,583
Get the theological

1471
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Oh well then I'm going to have to leave sir

1472
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
Question is why is there oil and I have to get to be illogical to answer it by

1473
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:44,383
You don't have an answer

1474
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,199
I mostly bring this up

1475
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
Show this to be like all right

1476
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,831
Joel skousen is somebody who Alex thinks his

1477
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
Super credible

1478
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Very

1479
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439

1484
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,031
What is the level of

If you don't start quite that bad you know we're eventually going to go

1504
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119

01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
