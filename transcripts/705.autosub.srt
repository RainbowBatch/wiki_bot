00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Jordan

00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
MoneyGram

4
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Alex

5
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Acknowledge fight.com

6
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
I love you

7
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,488
So folks big big developments

8
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
India in the world of Alex Jones

9
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,144
This is a bizarre way to start the show but here here's the reality

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
I'm sitting here and I'm recording this

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
With no Jordan

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
I am

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:21,408
H mere hours away from getting on a plane and flying to Austin Texas

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,784
Where me and Jordan will be enjoying enjoying seems to

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
Make it sound like fun we will be

16
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
Participating in and observing

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
The

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,208
The trial that Alex Jones is going to be going through

19
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
But unfortunately I can't take any time off because

20
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
What happens here

21
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
What happened to your on Saturday

22
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,520
But does Steve Bannon release a f****** episode of his war room show where interviews Alex

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
In order to promote his stupid documentary

24
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
Alex's War

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,456
That's all I feel like I've got to talk about it but there's no Jordan

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
It just leaves me to think

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,648
Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods

28
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
Where's the StreetWise Hercules

29
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
Isn't there a White Knight

30
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
Hope all the fiery feed

31
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Play the night I toss and turn. I need I need a hero

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
What is this

33
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
Discover heaven

34
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Robert Evans

35
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
Wow magically to life

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
By the power of music

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
By the power of Pat Benatar apparently Benatar mistakenly thought with the one who

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Did the song but I told you to sing it and Pat Benatar style anyway

39
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
And here we are here I am

40
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Summon

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
Well thank you thank you for answering the call

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
Of the Bonnie Tyler call for a Hero

43
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
I appreciate it we're going to be sitting here we can talk a little bit about Steve Bannon having Alex on

44
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,416
I understand you you covered Bannon a little bit in the past yes

45
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,280
As he was known in the krassensteins children book children's book

46
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Because he was a squirrel that lifted Donald Trump's hair

47
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
Those guys were so created an American that was

48
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Yeah

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
That's really what cancel culture took from us

50
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
This

51
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
We lost we lost the krassensteins

52
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
And life has not been worth living for a single second

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Nature has not healed

54
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
Are they active improved social

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,488
Do we know if they're on the other they must be I can't imagine is given

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
If I were Trump I would

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
I would definitely I'd give them a verified account

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Great for him

59
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
If I were Trump I would make them collectively my vice president

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Absolutely

61
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
So beat you give me he sucks we can all agree on this right I mean

62
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
I don't like him

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
And look here's the top because one of the things I hate most

64
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Right we can all agree

65
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
On team trying to be better people that it's not

66
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Not good to make fun of

67
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
Somebody for their appearance when there's so many things that have nothing to do with therapy

68
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
But

69
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Looks like something a British /

70
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,567
He looks boiled

71
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
He looks like one of those

72
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Unsettling puddings that the bridge blood sausage I'm not a good enough person not to comment

73
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
It looks like it like a half English breakfasts

74
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
Yes exactly he looks like a blood sausage

75
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
In some sort of blumaan

76
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Dina's

77
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
Coalesced into a baby

78
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
And unfortunately

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
It also happened that he was like

80
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,471
The person who had access to the most money in the deepest understanding

81
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
Of what the internet had changed about human social interactions

82
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Circa 2000

83
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
14 ish

84
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
And he made a lot of Haywood

85
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
Plugged into other folks who could do something with

86
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Do you know that sucks

87
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
He's very smart

88
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
He gets

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
You can find

90
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Packers won this

91
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
This week from Christianity

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
The day that

93
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
Largely silly but makes a good point of highlighting the thing about banning that

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
That's important

95
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
The understanding he came

96
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
To about

97
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
The fantasy

98
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
World

99
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
People like to live in and there's a bit he goes on where he's like

100
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
You imagine this guy Bob

101
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Who's the f****** account

102
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Bob.

103
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
You know some f****** mortician has to make out or whatever

104
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
Funeral regrets make up a 5 minute

105
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
Funeral

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
But imagine like

107
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Online Bob's got this

108
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Big digital presence in My World of Warcraft or something

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
This great warrior

110
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
1000 people show up in the internet tax

111
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
We like

112
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
Celebrations his heroic Deeds at all this

113
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
What would rub Bob

114
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
Identify more as what identity is more real than anything

115
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Banning came to aesthetic

116
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
You can provide people with these kind of like

117
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
Provide people with an outlet for their fantasies that allowed

118
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
To feel like

119
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Whatever

120
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Weird little communities

121
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Fantastic

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
It worlds that got involved with online are impacting the real world

123
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Do you like make them

124
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,767
If you can make them feel like what they're doing online matters

125
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
You can build them

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
A chance to feel like a hero

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Through doing nothing but sitting at their computer

128
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
You can actually get quite a lot done

129
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
And I'm not I'm not explaining it super Wild

130
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Bannon

131
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Translated that into gamergate

132
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,503
It sounds like he could just be studying a lot of Alex's s*** to I mean like convincing the entire audience

133
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
That look they're just their fealty to him and

134
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
And I was supporting it show

135
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Is a fight against

136
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
This established

137
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Ben Powers

138
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
There's a lot of white van in gotha

139
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,583
It's just old fascism right like that whole thing is is pretty old-fashioned them

140
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
What Bannon

141
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Did that was

142
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Clever

143
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Was well.

144
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Berry effect

145
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Probably too

146
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
Sitting on your ass and like harassing

147
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
People over the internet

148
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Like that was the thing that he

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
You figured out kind of be gamification

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Of like

151
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Fascist

152
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Militant

153
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
In a way that that

154
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
He was the first person to really lock it down

155
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,231
And it is never it is always been to his benefit a potent force in American politics

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Well

157
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
That sucks

158
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Otherwise I would have

159
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Describe it a little better but you get the point

160
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
Yeah I think it's a during covid brain you did a fantastic job

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,567
I'm too I heard that Alex was on

162
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Abandoned show

163
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
And I almost fell out of my chair

164
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
I didn't mean that

165
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,623
What's your immediate response to hearing that I mean other than like foreboding

166
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Did it seem weird

167
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
If like

168
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
If I had the power to

169
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Prey in an air

170
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
That's that would have been the spot

171
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,727
Well you're never going to get them cuz they're in that pandemic War Room bunker

172
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
You have to assume you need one of those

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Does bunker Busters

174
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Fox informed me about when we were going out

175
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Saddam

176
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,223
Yeah I've never listen to Bandon show because

177
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
I don't I don't have time or the emotional energy

178
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
But I did I listen to this episode and I was shocked

179
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
That they're like

180
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Their theme music is kind of

181
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
It's got a little bit of a rat

182
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Flair to it

183
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
And it's about how like

184
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
We're going to take out the cccp and

185
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,935
We're going to be there until everyone's dead

186
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,775
It's a pretty bizarre vibe that they got going on

187
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Apparently

188
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,735
If you go by the theme song it's mostly about hating China but that is not what I took away from from this

189
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
The screening

190
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Best viewing

191
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
So Alex is on

192
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
And

193
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
It's the it's it's really bizarre

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Because

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
These two

196
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
I don't know if I've ever heard of them

197
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Interact

198
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Huge figures in Trump World

199
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
And I have some awareness of some beef

200
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
A witch make this

201
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Just seem even more unlikely

202
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711
I'm so I was really excited to tune in and see what we would find

203
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,807
And turns out I think a lot of it is a press tour

204
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
For Alec that documentary Alex's War

205
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
It's going to be coming out

206
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
I don't know if you watched any of the

207
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
I've seen the ads for it I don't like the

208
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Bad and who again I think has a

209
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
A pretty canny understanding of like

210
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
What's a product

211
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,335
Road to go down propaganda lies I don't like that he sees turning Alex into a college celeb

212
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Money in Thai

213
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:58,527
Yeah and it's it's it's either something bad about the moment right now or a sign of

214
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Desperation between

215
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
The both of them

216
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
That's kind of how I'm

217
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
I'm seeing the ball breaking one of those Direct

218
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
Desperado be asleep there is some reason to Hope

219
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Like I don't want to be all doom are here

220
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Because like

221
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Banda MS

222
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
Actually might do sometime

223
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
In the very near future

224
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
Just got convicted this week as we record this

225
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
On two counts

226
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
F****** around with Congress both of which

227
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
Prison for up to a year

228
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
And

229
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Then

230
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
You've got like

231
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
Alex who is in the finding out stage of all of his

232
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
Court cases so sure

233
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
I feel like they're their circumstances of

234
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
Pure desperate enough that it's like let's see what we can do

235
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
You have a little bit of juice I got a little bit of juice let's make a cocktail

236
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Or something

237
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
I don't know that I I have

238
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Yeah

239
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
I wish I had more hope

240
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
That it was

241
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
This was like

242
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
The dying gasp of a wounded animal rather than

243
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,319
The step one in the eventually seeing billboards with Alex's face on them in Times Square

244
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah that is that is worrisome because you have something of a brand rehabilitation in some

245
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
What's going on

246
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
You know you have

247
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
If documentary

248
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,191
It's seeking to obviously in some way whitewash a lot of Alex's

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Quote-unquote mistake

250
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
He's made in his career

251
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
And you have Bannon who like

252
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
As much of a

253
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Fringe figure if he is

254
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
He is on a lot more radio stations

255
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Then

256
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Did you expect

257
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Cuz he's indicated with that like America's Voice or

258
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Whatever the

259
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
That thing is called

260
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
They've grown substantially

261
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
In the

262
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
Yeah and Glenn Greenwald was hosting that question and answer thing or earlier today about

263
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
Via about Alex's documentary

264
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,823
There's there's a lot of fear I don't think billboard in Times Square but you know something

265
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah that's not great

266
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
So let's jump in here I want to play this first clip for you this is this is the here where band

267
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Bringing Alex Indie setting

268
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Table

269
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
About that about his feelings for the center

270
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
John's crazy socks

271
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Conspiracy theory guy's a nut case you got the grants and all that

272
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
What they miss

273
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
Is it this guy's ahead of the curb

274
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
So many different top

275
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Of signal.not noise

276
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
He's one of the the the

277
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
The really the leader

278
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
In describing with transhuman

279
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Ism

280
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Is it

281
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Dangerous and what's

282
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,903
So that there's a there's a code that goes through a bit of this

283
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Episode

284
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
Signal not noise

285
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Which seems like just kind of the Weasley way to say like he's wrong about everything if you listen you is going to be constantly

286
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Wrong about stuff

287
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
But if you look at the big

288
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Big picture you could kind of

289
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah

290
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
I guess that is an interesting way of like

291
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Bannon's phrasing of the Alex Jones

292
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Was right kinda

293
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
Yeah it's it's signal is right there's a lot of static

294
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,927
You know you throw around a lot of bulshit

295
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
We wrong about everything but

296
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Yeah yeah yeah

297
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
You can trick yourself into thinking that he knows things

298
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
He's right about the time

299
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
And then at the end you can hear him bring up the transhumanism and that's because I think that banning just one

300
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Wants to be like

301
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Alright

302
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Look there's a lot b*******

303
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,991
There's a lot of dumb stuff but Alex has been saying that they're going to put robots inside you

304
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
For twenty years

305
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Which I guess is fair

306
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
I mean that is going to do the mark of the beast the chipping of people and stuff is a that's like the safest

307
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,559
Big scale future prediction to make though is that like they're going to start putting robot parts

308
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Course they are

309
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Like yeah. They is in like

310
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
People are going to like increasingly do more body modification

311
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
Like we have throughout history

312
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,175
Yeah people are already doing that like themselves there's DIY

313
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
Stop I have a chip in my hand that has a business card on

314
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Like it's just a thing people do cuz

315
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Meet and they're bored

316
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
Yeah some people put magnets in their fingers

317
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,791
I don't write you can use his hand to open the electronic locked his front door

318
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,423
Wow there are people who do it if it's not the government that's doing it

319
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
But it is it isn't it

320
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,567
It's a trend that could progress into like

321
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Some kind of a like

322
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Robot arms

323
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Or something or it might not

324
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Who knows

325
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
4 years

326
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
An app forever

327
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
Science fiction writers they did they write about like

328
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
You know these these questions of what does it mean to be human

329
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
And obviously this is going to be fertile territory for it

330
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
So confusing theorists TalkBack

331
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
It's safe

332
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
And that's that's why Bannon wants to

333
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Like really Center thing

334
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Is there

335
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
I think that's a good move on

336
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
I think it's smart

337
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
To do that instead of

338
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Stupid s***

339
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
About

340
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
The EU doing 9/11

341
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Well that I do

342
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
You think that was EU

343
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Yep yep yep yep

344
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Bournout

345
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,463
A lot of people don't know this but Osama Bin Laden and Angela Merkel

346
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Same person

347
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Whoa I've never seen them together

348
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
That is true

349
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
And you know I have this baby

350
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Exactly right

351
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
I was thinking about like if I could

352
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Feed Glenn Greenwald one question to ask

353
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Amad q-and-a session

354
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
It would be

355
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,711
Who is the head of the EU right now and what is their position called

356
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
I bet he couldn't name

357
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Even swap it out with a um

358
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
Who's in charge of the um and once had positioned called

359
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
That's always like the actual thing if you were if you really cared about interviewing Alex is like a credible journalist

360
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Ask him a basic question

361
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
About like fundamental facts

362
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Reality

363
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Like

364
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Who is running like

365
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
How does the how does the eu's like economic system actually work like who makes dislike our decisions like voted on

366
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Ron and stuff

367
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
You know

368
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
Any any kind of like very basic reality question he's just not going to be able to answer

369
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Doesn't understand any of

370
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Like it we can rattle off

371
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Facts about like

372
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
The year that something happened or like the name of some document but anything past that

373
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
If he was a smarter propaganda

374
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
But there's also two little facts

375
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,639
Ticket learn that can make him better at that like the fact that like a big chunk of the eu's economic Administration

376
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Is done in the building in Berlin

377
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
For the luftwaffe

378
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Hermann Goering Sophos

379
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
It's the Germans keep repurposed

380
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
If you wanted to make a conspiracy out of that

381
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
And he knew like three facts

382
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,999
It's about the EU he could actually put something together but he doesn't

383
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Dammit Robert this is going to be on his show in a week

384
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
If it's too good

385
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
I'll just trying to help the man out he seems to be having a rough one

386
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
It's it is tough times

387
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,359
Shannon plays the book the trailer

388
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
For Alex's documentary

389
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
A number of times

390
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
And there was one little clip that stuck out to me

391
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Emma play that here real quick

392
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,879
Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting was claimed the lives of

393
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
20 children was fake

394
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Did the New York Times get in trouble

395
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,143
For consciously lying about wmds then led to a war killed tens of thousands in Conflict now

396
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
I think he's playing a little fast and loose

397
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
I with details about that cuz for one I don't know if it's fair or necessarily to say that the New York Times

398
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
Pause the Iraq War

399
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
I think the whole argument is that they like Bush Administration was planning to do any of it like

400
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
You know they belong predated

401
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:06,463
Maybe some sloppy reporting by the New York Times help justify it certainly was

402
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
Made it easier for them did not

403
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
But I think it'd be fair to say did not use the kind of journalist

404
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Gregor they should have

405
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
But you know who else didn't use the kind of journalist

406
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Regulation of the Iraq War

407
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Glenn Greenwald

408
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Who support

409
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,407
I would have Alex I would feed him a question to ask Greenwald about that

410
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
Yeah and also the New York Times in 2004 issued like a huge apology about their car

411
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Calvary

412
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Judith Miller was the

413
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
The main

414
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Person who's making the most

415
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
You know high-profile

416
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Errors with c

417
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
And she got forced out of the paper in 2005

418
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
And

419
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
As she work

420
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
In any meaningful way in journalism son

421
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
There are consequences for these folks just Alex doesn't care

422
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
He doesn't know

423
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
And

424
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
He just makes things up

425
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
They were reporting portal

426
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
She makes things up

427
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Little bit of a difference

428
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
It is there is a difference between like

429
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
I don't know

430
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah yeah there's a difference I guess when you when you start to

431
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,375
Compare the consequences the size and relative influence

432
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
The New York Times makes me

433
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,495
Thank you could probably argue that their failure in the Iraq War

434
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
Did more damage than a lot of the stuff Alex

435
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Pakistan

436
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,431
I think you definitely could in terms of scale for sure it's a different point

437
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
But I think that's fair

438
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
When you try and get yourself off the hook for your behaviors by being like well I didn't cause a war

439
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
I don't know if that's meaningful

440
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
I don't I don't know

441
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Still bad

442
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,375
Savannah gets around to introducing Alex here

443
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
And

444
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Here here

445
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
Get here was

446
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,055
What I thought was going to be like the beginning of a really exciting in her

447
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Alex thank you very much

448
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
About this movie

449
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
A great filmmaker made the

450
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
This you're interviewed for

451
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
But other than that

452
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
It's their film

453
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
It is

454
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
Documentary Robert Mueller

455
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
These tablets were they always lie

456
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
But I've seen some horror films in

457
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
A bad light

458
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
An Android lockers I mean a real person just like you

459
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
But it's hard to come on here Steve

460
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
It's hard to come on here Steve

461
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
That's exciting line

462
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Now

463
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,407
The reason that was really exciting for me was because I know that Alex

464
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Heat Steve

465
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,063
I am sure he's he's repeatedly as I've learned through your show at active

466
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Deaf

467
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
Almost constantly

468
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,535
For years he's a scapegoat that I went to his used to like try and get Trump off the hook for things

469
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,399
It's all I got really excited and I decided that I would put together a compilation

470
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
Of Alex talkingshit about Steve Bannon

471
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,079
I heard Manning was Forrest Gump for leaving but I didn't want to put out Rumors by to get that from the White House tours

472
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Now the president

473
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
I was on your show a couple of months ago and I said that

474
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Steve Bannon

475
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
What's a complete sociopath

476
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
And eventually he would

477
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
Trapping cell

478
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
It is lies

479
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,512
And it's collusions with his colleagues

480
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,352
I am for the indictment conviction and prison

481
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Steve Bannon

482
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
The reason is very simple

483
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
10 in is what we call a self-promoter

484
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,872
A nicer term or a different term would be a BS artist

485
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
He just sits there and it sits back and watches

486
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Is it a blow-up Lighthouse political

487
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Likes of you

488
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Watch Opposite distance

489
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
Outside know it's dandruff

490
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Ketchup stains

491
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,168
Illuminati with money after he died

492
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
The Godfather Liberty Movement

493
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,920
CBS and running around Minato the FBI

494
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Fawning and agreeing

495
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
With the Russia investigation

496
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
I've taken over the light and Steve Bannon

497
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
New problems but they don't surprise me

498
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,952
Because we know definitively

499
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,072
Contradicted his testimony at my trial

500
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
Our work and which is great

501
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,800
Adopted by Banning Banning didn't come up with all this

502
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
Movie screenplay writer

503
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
Okay they wrote a screenplay off the show

504
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
Telesto pissed they got all the phones tapped they know

505
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
I'll still listen everyday

506
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Okay

507
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,120
I don't know if you know this but this is first-hand from the people involved

508
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,960
Steve is working with Mike cernovich and Jack Pacific now

509
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
I know people who were working directly with them

510
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
And they told me their goal was to destroy

511
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
You

512
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Steve Bannon

513
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Trader

514
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,296
I don't like Steven man and he's done some nasty stuff you bear false witness

515
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
Rodger Stone

516
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
Hindsight is 20/20

517
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
I can say is this

518
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Michelle Damn back

519
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
Sociopaths and Psychopaths

520
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
And

521
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,592
Weak people that have been abused themselves they got do it to other things but they're they're owed something

522
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
That's really what it is

523
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
I think band is kind of one of those want to show everybody that he's the big man

524
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
He's the top guy he's the leader he's in control

525
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,136
Overthrow everybody around him so he can feel like

526
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
Hawaii

527
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,816
Yep so I mean it's pretty consistent

528
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,656
I hope he does his Steve Bannon voice in this interview

529
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
What's

530
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
I hope he asks him about that plot to destroy Alex that the Paseo bacon crnkovich were working on the fan

531
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,944
Frank talk about Steve Bannon Plata

532
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Destroyer

533
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,320
Sure orders effects chatting after a football's game

534
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:31,232
Or what about by Steve Bannon perjuring himself in order to get Rodger Stone locked up

535
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
They said that's definitively that the in Infowars lore

536
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
Steve Bannon lied

537
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Rodger Stone

538
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,104
Yeah but given how much money Stone was costing Infowars are we sure Alex thinks that's a bad thing

539
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
I mean if the North Korean boats story headstock

540
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,088
I think Alex would want to see Rodger silenced in some way

541
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Taken taken

542
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Him to prison

543
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
Also I love the idea I was going back through some of these banding clip I didn't realize that Alex had suggested that he

544
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
He was a sociopath

545
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Who had been abused

546
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
That was why he was on this Power Trip

547
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Particularly

548
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Flare the empanada

549
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Alex

550
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah yeah

551
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
I agree

552
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
So when I heard him say it's hard to come on

553
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
I was hoping like

554
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Alright

555
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,576
We're going to air it out this is going to be great

556
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
Years he's hated Bannon

557
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
But of course

558
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Aegis

559
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Precedes

560
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
The kiss bannon's ass

561
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
In a way that is

562
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Just embarrassing

563
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
I think if you listen to the end of this clip

564
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,472
You'll hear Steve Bannon himself being embarrassed by Alex's behave

565
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
But it's hard to come on here Steve

566
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
David margiotti was a brain

567
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,920
Able to do and you've had the most courage

568
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
I'm anybody out there

569
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Standing up to the January 6th Broad and Everly

570
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
Bring America back

571
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
It's hard to come on your show

572
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
And and then talk about myself Heritage surreal

573
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
With

574
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,048
What you did not backing out of the committee

575
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Add

576
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
Them and their kangaroo court and how they wouldn't let you cross-examine people

577
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,984
I'm patient 3-ring lawsuits run by democrats

578
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Baymont in Travis County that

579
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Rick Perry and Tom DeLay

580
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
That I'm not allowed to say I'm innocent at my trial next week that starts

581
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
You cannot say you're innocent

582
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
You cannot say it's rigged

583
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
And you can I mean it's insane

584
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,136
I'm posed to sit there and not talking and not say I'm innocent

585
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
This is the end of America so they can destroy Steve Bannon

586
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
Alex Jones they can destroy you so I'm just

587
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
I'm not gushing here

588
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
I'm gushing because

589
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Literally we are in the arena

590
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
And I

591
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,288
And you would have greater love I got to say they are so scared of you

592
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,104
And an admirer of your work

593
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,712
And I have going to really really push people in a taxi and stuff to tonight

594
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
Because they're wrong and when they do they're buying into the global propaganda

595
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
So I am really

596
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,696
This is a big bucket list being on your show and I'm I'm so proud of the fact that exploded

597
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,512
Everybody talks about I'm at the grocery store I'm at church

598
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Everywhere

599
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
Almost everyday

600
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
I really love your style of Steve Bannon did you see this you see that I don't get like envious I feel good while going to sleep at night

601
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
Next week least ybanez out there

602
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Can you put together

603
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,224
But here is the reason I want to have you honestly felt but the films of Powerhouse

604
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
House film

605
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
That's that's you know you spent

606
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
2 minutes talking about like how

607
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:44,000
It's your dream to talk to this person and they're your hero

608
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
And then they just sort of like

609
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
You talk about your film

610
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
That hurts a little right

611
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
I mean

612
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
It's not that what you want

613
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
So what you think about what you think about this turnaround

614
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,920
Well I mean it it seems like the thing Alex always does

615
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,272
Which is that he's capable of having a wide variety of opinions largely negative

616
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
About other people who are prominent

617
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
Until those people are willing to talk with him for 30 seconds

618
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
At which point they become his favorite person

619
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
It's like what

620
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
It's how we can go from threatening Joe Rogan's children

621
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
To talking about how he's leading the

622
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
The the

623
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
I don't know whatever the the

624
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Devolution

625
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
The human mind

626
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
Your second only to Tucker

627
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,848
I never friend

628
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
It is I he hasn't done that with Tucker though right

629
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
I'm going to guess that like

630
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Cuz obviously he's got back

631
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Danforth on Rogan basically everybody

632
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
Has he ever said bad s*** about Tucker

633
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
Yeah back in the day back when he was like more of a neocon bowtie guy for sure

634
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Kind of

635
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
Crossfire days Alex heads

636
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,544
Until like it didn't come up often but I know that there was

637
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
A little bit of distain between them

638
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Tucker dude like

639
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,272
You came on Infowars once or twice and it wasn't like super hostel

640
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
But it definitely was not like

641
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
This guy gets it

642
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
He knows everything it was more like

643
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
Alright I'm going to talk to this neocon for a little bit

644
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
I will see if we can get it to wake up

645
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
MN

646
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
He wouldn't show back up

647
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
But yeah I know I think Alex knows better than to threaten

648
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Tucker

649
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Tucker's way

650
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Way more of a hold of the you like

651
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Weird

652
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Trump is like guys

653
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Yeah

654
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Well I also think he's

655
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Kind of

656
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Scared of Tucker

657
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Like most

658
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Then maybe meme

659
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Reading some

660
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
What do you think he's scared of Tucker doing

661
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Like

662
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Labeling of a globalist

663
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,352
Yeah I mean I think he's definitely I think he's definitely aware that Tucker could

664
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Could do damage to him

665
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
But I also think more than anything he's scared the Tucker

666
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Chris going to render him

667
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Whitney irrelevant

668
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,616
True I see kind of I feel like there's a little desperation

669
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
And how he praises

670
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Tucker

671
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
That makes sense

672
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
I mean you know the man better than I do

673
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
But that's that's

674
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
That's just kind of what I

675
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
Yeah I think so I mean as much desperation as there is an

676
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,024
I go to sleep at night comfortable knowing that if I go to jail Steve Bannon is out there

677
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
You know it's

678
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,120
There's desperation all around

679
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
And some of it is

680
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,496
Like a recognition of being able to siphon publicity

681
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
And then yet some of it is

682
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Probably in

683
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Recognition of his

684
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Is obsolescence

685
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
How do you spell obsolete since the internet

686
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Really picked up as much as

687
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
The dead like

688
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
YouTube

689
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Largely

690
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
Hindered his his Stranglehold on

691
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
My gatekeeping

692
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Conspiracies

693
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
Tucker gets to the

694
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
To the the old folk

695
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Says things

696
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Really

697
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,216
Softly he brings extremism into a a

698
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
A digestible paragraph

699
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,872
He's just actually better at doing Alec ship than Alex ever

700
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
What you make City makes it easier to swallow

701
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
Did you hear from like all the the Nazi types

702
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
Andover like Tucker

703
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
It's just doing our s*** better

704
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
You hear that

705
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
And not message boards

706
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
From time to time

707
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
So

708
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
Here's Steve Bannon embarrassing himself severely

709
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
The point I don't think

710
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
People get about

711
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
We do it the worm and I person

712
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Because I followed you

713
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
4 years

714
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
Is that

715
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
You're not just a man of Ash

716
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
Actually

717
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
The guy that sell Turbo

718
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Saying hey

719
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
You know I'm liking the first tank

720
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
And we'll drive this

721
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
As

722
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Much in his importance that leadership

723
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
The true

724
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Thing that you've done

725
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Which is

726
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Stunning

727
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
If you look at the evidence of that in the facts

728
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
You are one of the Great

729
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Thinkers

730
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
That is very where you got to go back

731
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
The Revolutionary

732
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Regeneration

733
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Yeah man

734
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Alex is one of the great thinkers

735
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Of our time

736
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Politically

737
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Culturally

738
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Spiritually

739
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
Musically

740
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Musically

741
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
You've got me Randa rannigan man

742
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
Oh no

743
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,840
Found a pretty dope cover of Hungry Like the Wolf by Reel Big Fish the other day with love now he's at on a

744
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
I will I will cut it in

745
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
Splice it together for you

746
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Is that new

747
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
That Reel Big Fish cover

748
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
But it's it's axilla

749
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,968
You can find it on on the YouTube sin the Spotify

750
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,088
Where they just became basically like a cover band

751
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
I mean I have not

752
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,000
Caught up I don't know when they'll most recent of their albums was but they've definitely got a lot of covers

753
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,608
I mean that's guidance that is the natural journey of every great Scott

754
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Yeah

755
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Because the secret of music

756
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
That that's like at the core of

757
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
Of all the FEMA creation

758
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
Is that every song is better as a stop

759
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
Yeah everything is better with butter

760
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,064
Streetlight Manifesto to the cover of Such Great Heights that is

761
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Very very fun

762
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
Mommy like Less Than Jake became a cover band

763
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,744
In fiery Reel Big Fish has become a cover band

764
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
Like Me First and the Gimme Gimmes we're the ones who got it

765
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
ATM out the gate a cover band

766
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,520
Anyway I saw the rice off Mighty Mighty Bosstones at Riot Fest last year too depressed

767
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
That was right before Vicky parrot

768
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Became an anti-vaxxer

769
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,528
I don't think anybody needs to be listening to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones after that George Floyd album they put out

770
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
Isis was before the fact

771
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
I think I hope

772
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,488
Yeah it definitely was before I was aware of that

773
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
So Banning

774
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Love's

775
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Infowars

776
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Amy loves Alex

777
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,960
I don't know if you'll believe this Robert but

778
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
He claims that he listens everyday

779
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
You believe that

780
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Yeah me neither

781
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
But here here he is saying

782
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
You know people that watch your show know me over the years

783
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
4 * The Economist

784
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Oswego through that's

785
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
So I'm a I'm a huge

786
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Believer in

787
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Information

788
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
And I go to

789
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
The yobs

790
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Infowars everyday

791
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
In Fallout

792
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
You know why

793
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Ahead of the Curve

794
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
He's been

795
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Demon eyes

796
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Conspiracy theories

797
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Right

798
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
I got to tell you

799
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
This book The Great reset in the war for the world

800
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Left in the mainstream media are going

801
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Going to have to sit

802
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Get there

803
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
And we got to

804
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Forestdale

805
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Responded

806
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
This book is that in

807
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,840
No Force necessary I mean I'm not the left nor the mainstream media but I'll

808
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
The end of this book

809
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Coming out

810
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,336
I've heard Rumblings of this and there's been there's been talk of it but

811
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,944
Alex's apparently coming out with a book I think it's getting rushed out because

812
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,040
There's a bit of a blitz going on right now and

813
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,112
The timing is not not suspicious

814
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
In terms of his

815
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
Israel happening

816
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
Starting on the 25th and going

817
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
Probably until the beginning of August or so

818
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
You on the 29th

819
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,960
You have his documentary coming out and then his book is supposed to come out in early August

820
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
I think there's a little bit of a like

821
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
Let's have something else to talk about

822
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
Kind of vibe going on

823
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
There's a couple things I have to think about this book

824
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
The first

825
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Is that there is

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
0% chance that Alex wrote this

827
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah I mean he's too rich to write a book write like

828
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,792
That's not the problem that I would have

829
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,240
I don't know if you can write a book by skimming

830
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,128
But like I think I think you have a really rich people will have like ghostwriters

831
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
Write something

832
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
Or or or whatever but like

833
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
Alex is so f****** lazy

834
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,648
He couldn't write an article on his own website has a team of people to do that

835
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,976
I have no faith he could Emmett the last book he wrote

836
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Inferior

837
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
I'm not even sure if he wrote that one was like

838
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,400
15 years ago we wrote some night like a 911 book

839
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Probably like Jason bermas rotor or something

840
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,408
What would I wouldn't be surprised given him being the guy that he is if

841
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
If you'd like if he does a lot of like

842
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
Dictating that's how Hitler wrote his book

843
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
You know

844
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,856
Some people some people have too much

845
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,952
Get like to walk around and talk too much to actually write a book

846
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
And so

847
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,816
Those people have their their their Rudolf Hess or their whatever gyro talents

848
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Well I if that's the case I can't wait to read it

849
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
Because the

850
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,056
Who sang who could transcribe the nonsense

851
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,384
That Alex is going to have have

852
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
I've thrown out I mean

853
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
Does the syntax

854
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Is going to be revolutionary

855
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
I think that

856
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
The great the great English professors

857
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Will struggle to deal with

858
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
Alex's

859
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
Run-on sentence

860
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
Hemingway-esque run-on sentences

861
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
I predict

862
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,448
Yeah I think that books going to be dumb it's just about the great reset so

863
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Complaining about Klaus Schwab and

864
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
But Noah Harari guy

865
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Yeah

866
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
Sapiens right he's

867
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
I mean the Futurity in Dushore

868
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
Kind of boring

869
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
I'm going to guess that your assessment is not going to match Alec

870
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
And in this forthcoming book

871
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,632
Yeah I don't know I thought it was kind of boring

872
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Like most books that Barack Obama recommend

873
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
I don't think I've ever read it I don't

874
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
I don't know I don't I don't gravitate towards

875
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
The genre of

876
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
Futurists writing

877
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Too much

878
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
Like I would rather

879
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Futurist

880
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,976
History of

881
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Hominids

882
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,168
Okay baby I'm just categorizing it wrong because that's like what he is

883
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
You're yeah you were thinking of so that I have not read this book he wrote another book called a homo Deus

884
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
Yeah that's I think

885
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Business future

886
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
Okay that's

887
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
That makes

888
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
That's me that's the sort of

889
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:23,648
Cubby hole that he existed without so I just assumed like pretty much all of his career revolve around that

890
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
Fear this book is going to suck I'm sure

891
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
But I'm excited for it

892
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,328
I will definitely do a

893
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Protracted series

894
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
On it as soon as it comes out

895
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:39,264
And that turns out to be exactly what Bannon thinks I can

896
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Do

897
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,360
I tell you what let's hang out we'd love to keep you for one more cigarette

898
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
If you want Steve is awesome

899
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,712
Okay if we got Alex Jones the book

900
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
Is the great reset in the war for

901
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
For the world

902
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
This is Ace

903
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Seminole

904
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Madeline Peltz

905
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
I dare anybody to go

906
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Read it

907
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
IND

908
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Jeffy the rapper

909
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
And the deconstruct

910
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Major work

911
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Bye-bye

912
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Major

913
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
This is not intellectual

914
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
They're accepted

915
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
100-percent I accept this

916
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
I know that I'm not cool like Media Matters

917
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
But I will I will handle

918
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
I'll handle this Bannon

919
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
And I'll get back to

920
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
I would

921
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
I think there's a pretty good shot of

922
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
You getting on Steve

923
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
And if that happens

924
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
You're going to need

925
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,632
The plunge the dagger of telling megiddo

926
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
Into the glowing spot at the base of his belly

927
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,568
In order marked by a ketchup stain that will finally bring the Kali Yuga

928
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:55,040
I I was looking at this guest list I think I fit right in a mean you got like jakpus obok you got an owie

929
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Packers close friends

930
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,720
Ritual. We ate at the same restaurant once I mean that was a child

931
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,792
That molestation Dan and I just thought it had pretty good pizza

932
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
But hey you know we're at work work clothes

933
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
Robin Malone

934
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,776
Sonic just outside Columbia Missouri

935
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
It's a mess

936
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
That places

937
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
It's haunted for sure

938
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
I'm so distant

939
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
This interview is

940
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
I'll be honest there's a lot of content in it that would just be

941
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Really

942
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Pointless and

943
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Boring

944
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
For like anybody listen sauropod

945
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
There's like

946
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,816
You know Alex will throw out things like why the future doesn't need us or

947
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:44,704
Eco science by John P holdren like I'll throw these things out as if he's like making an extra large in it but

948
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
It's just sort of scattershot reference

949
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
So I don't particularly care about that too much

950
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
I want to focus

951
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
On how sad this is

952
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Alex

953
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
Hates

954
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
Steve Bannon

955
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
Banning has never acknowledged Alex

956
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
And hear the two of them

957
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Desperately try to out

958
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
Complement each other

959
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
This is two men brought low

960
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Towards each

961
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Well you been through this President Trump's been

962
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
And what they do is

963
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
A populist

964
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Play fear

965
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
What Americans

966
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
American

967
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
Popular

968
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
Shut that down

969
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
Medina Ice-T band

970
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Donald Trump

971
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
And I'm not trying to

972
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
That back the league

973
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Make your property

974
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Pick-A-Part I am because

975
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
You're respecting her also

976
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
Better intelligence background of

977
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Dana was a blind Trust

978
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Potawatomi

979
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Trump successes

980
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
And I'm not

981
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,007
Trump

982
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Because I think

983
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
I like Trump you have

984
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Have a

985
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,175
It was Bernard Charles said only connect

986
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
You have a way of connect

987
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
With the working class

988
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Tree in the middle

989
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
That is very powerful

990
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
I mean what am I guilty

991
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
They're actually

992
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
I mean

993
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
Incredible you have a way of connecting

994
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Trump.has awake

995
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
That

996
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Is their biggest fear

997
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
The biggest fear is

998
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Is the

999
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,519
Education and Enlightenment The Awakening of that army of what I call the army of the awake

1000
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
And they will take

1001
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
I think Tucker and I are

1002
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Farhan backup

1003
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
Because you want Trump have a way

1004
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Connecting

1005
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
A hard connect

1006
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
With that

1007
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
That is

1008
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
You can't coach that

1009
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
That's a god-given

1010
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Do you have

1011
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
That's where the car I don't want

1012
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:47,583
What were they trying to do right now they've done everything possible

1013
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
So the

1014
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,191
You got this nice Vibe of

1015
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,751
You're awesome

1016
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,311
You are drunk or on the same

1017
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
God

1018
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
Given wavelength

1019
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
Connection to the

1020
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
To the the

1021
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
The real Folk

1022
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
Common people

1023
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,367
You understand your this organic connection

1024
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,183
And I would I would suggested maybe it's the

1025
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,511
Him and Trump are like they live in the fraud

1026
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
You know they live in that that manipulation so much

1027
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Vets

1028
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
That people connect to it

1029
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
More easily

1030
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
That could be

1031
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Part of it

1032
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
And someone like Tucker. Really

1033
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
I was trying to think about what

1034
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Like what connects Alex to

1035
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Two common people

1036
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Like what what is it

1037
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,527
He's been in media for 20-something years

1038
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
He's a millionaire

1039
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,111
You have multiple home

1040
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,487
He lives in one of the liberal enclaves of Austin Texas

1041
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
He is friends with celebrities

1042
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
He's having Steve Bannon tell him that he's

1043
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
One of the great thinkers since the revolutionary era

1044
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,287
Runs away from his fans when they confronted about the street

1045
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Because they scare him

1046
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,967
Like Blackwater security everywhere like he has a tank

1047
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
There's nothing he didn't hesitate text

1048
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
I think you did but that was that was just

1049
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,975
If that's who that's similar to what a lot of Americans are dealing with having cell there

1050
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,791
Extraneous out the tanks absolutely

1051
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
I wish more people were selling their tanks

1052
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Steven I might be able to buy one but

1053
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
You know you said something is second ago

1054
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,263
About what connects Alex to Common be

1055
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
And I know what you meant by that but now all I'm thinking

1056
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Thinking about

1057
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,175
Is Alex getting together with Ben Folds like Shatner did

1058
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
And doing a cover of folks comedy

1059
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,319
I think Alex actually could knock out of

1060
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
The park

1061
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
If

1062
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
Alex does lose everything

1063
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
We need to get him a record deal to do a Shatner type out

1064
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
Yeah exactly

1065
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
But also very Lounge

1066
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,167
So like in between songs there's got to be a little bit of banter

1067
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,007
You know you got to have some kind of word

1068
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,615
I mean the other option is to just have Alex do an exact

1069
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Perfect

1070
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,967
Word-for-word replica of Shatner's album has been

1071
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,015
So like Alex's

1072
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,623
Singing that song about Shatner finding his wife dead in the pool in about being the washed up

1073
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
Star Trek start

1074
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:27,071
I feel like you can talk Alex into doing that he hates Shatner now so like

1075
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
Backup

1076
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Try to do a better job than bill

1077
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
F****** perfect

1078
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
But

1079
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:40,895
I think Alex has beat I mean you know Steve Bannon is complimenting him quite a bit but I think he has the potential to be

1080
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
Like Paul Stanley level

1081
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Stage banter

1082
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Kind of guy

1083
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,367
Like really make it make it its own thing he could decode

1084
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,671
Revolutionize the art of

1085
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,231
Saying dumb s*** in between songs

1086
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
No absolute

1087
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
So we got one last clip here

1088
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
It was not very long enough

1089
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,423
It's just kind of vague

1090
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
Puff piece

1091
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,335
Promotion for the book that's not out and doesn't have a release date

1092
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
I am the documentary so it's basically just that

1093
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
And

1094
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,807
When this episode comes out I'll already be in Austin

1095
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
For the trial

1096
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
And

1097
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Here's him Alex telling ban in about this

1098
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,047
Everything Alex is saying is total b*******

1099
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
This is just

1100
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Offense

1101
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
I have

1102
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
The Motions in limine infowars.com

1103
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
Call the judge's order

1104
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
The first of three

1105
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,847
Ridge Sandy Hook trials where I've already been found guilty I've been

1106
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
Defaulted

1107
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
When I gave them everything and more which they used it as a boy

1108
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
Blueprint

1109
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
Find nerdy bankers

1110
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
Platformers

1111
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
And the judge

1112
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,623
Put in the order for the trial where I'm guilty

1113
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
But I cannot say I'm innocent

1114
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Says word for word

1115
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,999
Anyway

1116
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Murderer

1117
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,095
Call dead bodies in my basement I would get up and say I minutes

1118
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
No I am guilty

1119
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
And I can't cross-examine anybody

1120
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,055
And I can't raise the First Amendment

1121
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
And I can't say that

1122
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Order to have this trial

1123
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
Or I'll be held in contempt

1124
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,527
She did a million-dollar fine a month ago

1125
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Court Appeals

1126
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
One day a million dollars

1127
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,463
And I'm out of money they finally run me to ground

1128
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
I paid a million dollars

1129
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
On Monday

1130
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,351
Literally bought the company that like $3,000 in the bank

1131
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
That's okay

1132
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
This is a real war

1133
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
If you mailed it

1134
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
You stole my phone

1135
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
Understand why you want to show people this is veritas

1136
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,567
Which particle

1137
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,663
They hate barbecue in the family way

1138
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
They hate Donald Trump

1139
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
They hate me because

1140
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
We are populist we are we love the people

1141
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
The people get that they

1142
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
See if they can feel it and gone through

1143
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
And they don't want them to have

1144
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
Spirit

1145
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
And destroy us

1146
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,815
That's their symbol American people Trump always said

1147
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,887
Look they got to get through me to get to you and it's totally true

1148
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
We have decided to stand up

1149
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Love America

1150
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,007
Heroes we just can't

1151
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Rollover

1152
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,895
Soho they see us standing or no

1153
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
And smashes they can do it and

1154
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
This is not my rights are being robbed

1155
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,855
Dial

1156
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,207
DC situation we are all having our rights

1157
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
Stolen

1158
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
Say I'm innocent

1159
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,071
And can't say I'm bankrupt

1160
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
Campsaver three trials coming up

1161
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
Literally

1162
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
She says we can say almost nothing

1163
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
We have to be there

1164
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
And so

1165
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
That's where this is

1166
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,079
Criminal

1167
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,895
You just stop talking

1168
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,455
Don't like him

1169
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Comparing

1170
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Him

1171
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
After

1172
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,087
Like half a decade in the court

1173
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Having to pay money

1174
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
For slandering the family

1175
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Dead children

1176
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
To being a right

1177
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
I really I just I dislike

1178
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
I don't think

1179
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,607
I don't think you should be able to do that

1180
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
I agree with you and he Compares that use that comparison a lot and I

1181
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
I will say that I don't often

1182
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,127
Included on our show because of it being

1183
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,223
Usually of an obviously always a benzos

1184
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,599
Yeah also usually even if you tracked the thinking it didn't make it doesn't make sense

1185
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
A lot of the time

1186
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
Conceptual standpoint

1187
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,047
Important things to remember here beyond that too and that is one

1188
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,375
Bannon chose not to do defense

1189
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
He could have done he could have done a defense

1190
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
He did.

1191
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
All of the stuff I like to sing

1192
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
Are the products of his decision

1193
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,199
He had every possibility to be able to raise the 1st Amendment

1194
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Defense

1195
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
He didn't do it

1196
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,343
Teacups find a million dollars because

1197
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,439
Keep kept sending incompetent corporate representatives in the judge

1198
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,975
Ran out of options

1199
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
He can save that boo

1200
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,655
You know the trial is a like a staged rig thing

1201
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,239
He'll be taken out of court probably held in contempt just like

1202
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Anybody else in a courtroom would be

1203
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,407
Like this is he's not special there's no like special victimhood here

1204
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
It's the product of his choices

1205
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Because

1206
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
He knew that if he went to trial he would lose

1207
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,879
If you want to try all he would lose and it would be

1208
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
Embarrassing

1209
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
But

1210
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,743
If you just decided not to participate

1211
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Losing by default

1212
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:51,679
And this would be the situation we were in and he can be like always only I had my day If Only They allowed me to

1213
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
Defend myself

1214
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,079
It's all just b******* the same thing parents doing the same thing Rodger Stone did and his trial

1215
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
Like all of them don't defend themselves in the in the time when they are given the opportunity to because they know it all

1216
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,087
No way to defend their behavior

1217
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,391
So their only defense is

1218
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,999
Stretching it out as long as possible I guess and hoping that

1219
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
Once again the system

1220
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
Does not actually

1221
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Penalized

1222
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Away like

1223
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,423
Uno Spano probably get a weekend

1224
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Can a f******

1225
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Resort

1226
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
Yeah it's hard to fault somebody for thinking you won't get any consequences based on the lack of consequences

1227
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Usually yeah

1228
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,039
You just kick your feet and kick up dust

1229
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
I'm kind of just hope that

1230
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,183
Eventually you'll have some resolution where you don't have to reveal more information

1231
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
They'll be more destructive to

1232
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Your industry

1233
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
That sucks

1234
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:55,423
So I'll be in Austin I'll be watching the

1235
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,983
The proceedings where Alex is not allowed

1236
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
Bring up the First Amendment

1237
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,079
Is not allowed to call it a show trial

1238
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,431
You can't you can't believe that he's innocent because he's already been found guilty suit

1239
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,991
It's irrelevant to the case so he's lost by default

1240
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
There's no there's no

1241
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
This what I do

1242
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,671
I wonder if Alex will actually show up to the court

1243
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
That's something that I'm not sure about

1244
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Does he have

1245
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
I don't think he physically has what

1246
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
For him to not show up

1247
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,679
I would imagine there is

1248
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
He could just send his lawyers

1249
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,591
I don't I don't know I don't know he doesn't have to testify or anything I don't

1250
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,687
Yeah I mean if he doesn't have to I would have to guess he's probably not done

1251
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
Right

1252
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
But then the attention

1253
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,111
Possibility

1254
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
But you can say s*** outside the courtroom

1255
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:53,535
Well yeah I guess there's that like maybe it'll be worth it for him to show up outside

1256
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Or two shops

1257
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
He can go outside

1258
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
The courtroom at

1259
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,471
Keep it a f****** impromptu press conference at his custody hearing

1260
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
A couple years back

1261
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,847
Oh God yeah you know I had forgotten about that okay well we'll see

1262
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,455
I could I could see him doing like a little rally outside the courthouse

1263
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
Or something trying to

1264
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Promote

1265
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
His stupid documentary

1266
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,647
Yeah we'll see we'll be posting episodes

1267
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
Throughout the time they're in Austin

1268
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,743
Trying to find some

1269
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,559
Some relevant folks to interview perhaps in

1270
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,863
Trial updates

1271
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
So well be fun

1272
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
Robert thank you so much for joining me

1273
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,079
Do you have any any closing thoughts about to visit

1274
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
Disgraceful

1275
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
It explained

1276
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Number one

1277
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,759
Thought is that it's worrying that Alex and

1278
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:51,647
And Steve are getting closer together cuz those really aren't you worlds that I like being tied closed

1279
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
However

1280
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,767
Steve Bannon is is really dangerous and I worry about him a lot

1281
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
And Alex Jones

1282
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Is

1283
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,631
Has a mr. Magoo likeability to

1284
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
The trip up people around him and get them into terrible terrible trouble

1285
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,495
That's true

1286
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
So possibly this will go well

1287
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
More than anything Dan

1288
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
I'd like people to listen

1289
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,199
To the Ben Folds William Shatner album has been

1290
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
Particularly the cover of common people

1291
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
The chatter does on

1292
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
Is it it it

1293
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
It Fox

1294
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:24,415
I understand next week you're going to have a three parts behind the bastards

1295
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
About

1296
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
That album

1297
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
It is

1298
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
The bastard of that album is that I can't stop

1299
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Singing it

1300
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167
Is have everyone around you

1301
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
God label you the bastard for

1302
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
Incessant leasing in common

1303
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Well they're going to label me the bastard

1304
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,359
Cuz I think Shatner said some

1305
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
F***** up this

1306
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,967
I refuse to read any new news stories about Shatner it doesn't

1307
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,295
Okay then he's an old man and will be dead soon

1308
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
It's fine

1309
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
I'm unaware of

1310
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,975
Anything past him going to space that is where I checked out that was the last thing I needed from him

1311
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,071
Fulfilled your your narrative Arc

1312
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
And we got

1313
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,959
Yeah I sent him a letter the other day saying you're allowed to dye will

1314
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,799
You let him go I let him go I let him go

1315
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
That's big of you

1316
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,639
Well we should. Let ourselves go

1317
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,759
And wrap this up again people can find your podcast behind the bastards

1318
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Fantastic

1319
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319

What the power of song

I am no longer in need of a hero but but thank you for being one for me

1324
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,095
We will talk again soon

1325
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,887
Yay

1326
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:45,567
What a what a fine interview that was what it was but a lot of fun too.

1327
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,871
Talk about how stupid Steve Bannon is in

1328
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:53,247
Oh wow he's talking to Alex Jones God Kenny can you believe it Celine

1329
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015

1331
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
Keep it quiet and I have to pretend

Meow for you just going to kick back with a nice

1333

1335
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,007
No nice nice 2% beer

1336
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,871
You know that's about that's about what I want right about now maybe a little bit

1337
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:25,759
Hey Mark Basinger

1338
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
For sure I mean I was just about to enjoy this nice beer that's a really just lemonade but

1339
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,207
Want to have a chat with you

1340
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,071
You know what

1341
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
Even Keel you know heading into the

1342
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
4-year buildup of the most surreal trial in American memory that's going to be watched by the entire world

1343
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
I'm really chill about

1344
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,479
Yeah it seems like it you got it you got a laid-back Vibe I have to be honest I do not feel my radio theater that I just did

1345
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:03,135
I'm very self-conscious of Yeti better than the fur

1346
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,767
It's nice to talk to you I know that

1347
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,607
I'm going to be

1348
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:18,495
Recording this on Saturday evening I'm going to be there in person tomorrow

1349
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:23,615
But I wanted to sit down if it was it was it all possible and thankfully it is

1350
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,223
To talk a little bit about what people can expect of the

1351
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,551
The coming trial it's actually it looks like it's going to happen

1352
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,855
There's no more bankruptcy stunt yeah

1353
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:38,463
Yeah I'll be looking you know what to expect tell me I'm I'm waiting bated breath I'd love to know

1354
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
I expect a dry heat

1355
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,863
There is there's no way to tell us about that

1356
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
I'd like to say

1357
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,543
Tonight's plan coordinated a bit but I'm dealing with one of the most unproductive

1358
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
People in

1359
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Gosh

1360
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
In living memory

1361
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah who knows what's going to happen

1362
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,991
I think I know how it's going to go down

1363
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
But you know

1364
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
I mean

1365
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:09,695
There's a there's one thing that is B you know the preparation and the the law aspect of it in the trial

1366
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
And I I just I think I think you probably have your ducks in a row in terms of that

1367
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
The thing that just blows my mind is that you know we have

1368
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,007
This this case is starting on Mondays 25th

1369
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,359
And then on the 29th Alex is releasing his documentary

1370
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,687
Oh well I mean

1371
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
Take a break

1372
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
The trial of the century Casino

1373
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Jesus

1374
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
Yeah he's like really trying to steal Focus I don't know

1375
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
Glenn Greenwald

1376
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
Like right on the

1377
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,935
Really this is your best attempt

1378
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,079
Grab publicity after I've been absolutely smoking you in the entire Global media for 4 years

1379
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,871
Come out with the guy

1380
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,407
Cell movie in

1381
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:08,319
It's the guy who almost got Snowden arrested and you're going to like it really

1382
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
A green Walter that involved in the documentary I think he was a gun-for-hire for that q and a butt

1383
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,303
Ridiculous

1384
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,679
I was watching a little bit of that earlier before we started chatting and the director

1385
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
I was sitting in between Greenwald and Alex

1386
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:30,079
And she had her head down for long stretches of time

1387
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,615
Seem to not want to be there

1388
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,687
I'm not sure if I was reading too much into body language but

1389
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
Can't blame her

1390
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,111
Dogs get fleas

1391
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Regional thing or not

1392
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
Yeah I know

1393
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
I feel like it's good

1394
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,023
If he's burning time doing

1395
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
What's going on over there man it's a mess

1396
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,655
And then when they walk

1397
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
Look I think of

1398
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,823
Expectation

1399
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,687
They're they're going to garbage like that and we'll see how it goes

1400
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
It kind of went play was

1401
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
Let me know

1402
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:13,087
Right exactly if you know anything about the suit

1403
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
What you can predict is that anything you think is about to happen

1404
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
Not is exactly what

1405
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
What's not

1406
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,767
Did the one thing I do have to say about though it's like

1407
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,071
Set the Comfort I have going into this

1408
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,655
Is we have a trial judge who I know is not going to tolerate nonsense

1409
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,447
I think we've been waiting for you

1410
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,823
Jones

1411
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
Courtroom theatrics aren't going to be in Dish

1412
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,943
Some nonsense judge

1413
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,807
You need to see where you're going with this

1414
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
That's not what's going to happen

1415
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:54,815
That I had that I wanted to run by you and that is actually came up earlier I was talking to Robert and that is that

1416
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
Do you

1417
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,423
Know if Alex is actually going to have to be there

1418
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:08,895
I was thinking that there's and there's an entire possibility that he wouldn't even need to show up like a lawyer is good just

1419
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:14,015
Conceivably show up right

1420
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
Is I am starting to get asked

1421
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
When is

1422
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,463
The entire world who's and attention to the sting

1423
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,535
Tim will expect his trial

1424
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,655
Part and parcel with what this is

1425
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:36,799
Right kind of anti-climactic for anybody who likes Alex if he doesn't

1426
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:43,455
Right

1427
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,295
Or whatever that shot is butt butt

1428
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
Jury at some point

1429
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,927
Regardless

1430
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,511
They're going to want to see Alex Jones on the standings

1431
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
And whether that happens or not

1432
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,447
Control of that necessarily like that's not a thing

1433
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Cover

1434
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
Decides he wants to kick back into society

1435
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Trout

1436
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
I can't

1437
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
I don't have

1438
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,527
Enso Wheels but you don't really need to have him

1439
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
Like testify or anything like you do with no reason that you need to call him to the stand to make your case

1440
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,719
Look at this point

1441
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,191
The default judgment that resulted to us

1442
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,983
Is wow

1443
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Climax

1444
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Meaning

1445
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,943
Doesn't mean a damn thing there's not like you were going to walk into this try on people

1446
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
Defamation

1447
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,879
That was already decided like that's done and like

1448
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
Where you going to do is press

1449
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Wait

1450
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,511
There's not I don't want to put it to

1451
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
In other words what I want to say is my aunt's at this point

1452
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
Like it's not

1453
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:10,239
You can you can say all you want about how you perform in a trial that's going to be

1454
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,311
Amazon me and respect

1455
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,151
As far as what I can do to those poor people in the box with the decision they're going to make

1456
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,247
This is purely about

1457
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:25,855
Press play and let them react there's going to be 12 jurors and they're trying to come up with a number

1458
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
As much as I in my

1459
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Personal life in a rental

1460
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
I have a lot of

1461
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
Shaken faith in our systems and institutions one

1462
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
Bible Otto

1463
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
Cynicism

1464
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,335
I guess it's how you put it at built up after seeing how juries relaxer

1465
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
Sometimes

1466
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,919
But one thing I can say

1467
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
This particular truck

1468
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,759
This particular droughts

1469
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,575
There's never been anything like what Jones did

1470
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,671
This is what we would call in-law a matter of first impression

1471
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,279
I think this is nobody's going to have to do this is the first time a drink enough to look at this kind of comics

1472
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
10 years of somebody torturing

1473
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
Erin Burnett children

1474
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,423
They're going to have to come up with number of what it's worth

1475
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,727
And whatever number they come up with

1476
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
Is the correct

1477
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Number

1478
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,919
Not either party in this courtroom I am convinced is going to have much of an effect

1479
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,063
What they decide that correct number is they will be faced with what is basically Undisputed facts and they will

1480
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
Face

1481
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
The same

1482
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:34,207
Controversial National outrage that has consumed part of the country for so many years on this

1483
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,607
They will come up with that number

1484
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:45,983
At this point I put in the hands of those 12 and a lot of stuff to press play on

1485
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,871
Based on these depositions stuff that we've covered I imagine just

1486
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,759
Seeing the reaction of people to the lot of that be amazing

1487
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,135
One of my most rewarding things I do on this case is for the first time when I show somebody

1488
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
A

1489
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,815
An email a piece of deposition for a clip of diarrhea

1490
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Runaway

1491
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
Right right exact

1492
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:18,495
Or you know some of the people that you're going to be seen at this trial and I'm going to give kind of like a

1493
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:23,103
You know okay so I know your viewers love the deposition episodes

1494
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,479
It's baffling to me but yes

1495
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Because

1496
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,575
If you listen this deposition Strider on YouTube the rather dry

1497
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:41,535
Horner whatever but like the analysis y'all do in between questions

1498
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,863
I feel like we should just become a deposition cast

1499
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,679
Exactly

1500
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:51,775
Is there's going to be a bunch of deposition testimony Clips play at this trial

1501
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
But they've never seen

1502
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Really

1503
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,895
Bunch of new stuff

1504
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
This this raises the question

1505
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:04,319
After the trial are there going to be a bunch of deposition that will be public that weren't before

1506
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
Cuz if so

1507
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,927
2022

1508
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,815
They have not seen

1509
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:18,143
I heard because of the different rules up in Connecticut

1510
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,191
Damn yeah

1511
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,471
I have never heard

1512
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,495
Chris Maddie

1513
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
I never heard that

1514
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,735
And we've seen a little bit of the transcripts that have

1515
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,783
But you're going to see a couple of things in this

1516
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,671
When is the one that everybody already knows a small

1517
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,487
And we're going to be hearing from her is the corporate representative

1518
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,071
And then you're going to hear another deposition from the nobody's ever heard of

1519
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
And that's Robert Jacobs

1520
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,495
Jacobson was the former video editor for nearly 15 years at Infowars

1521
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,775
And he will test

1522
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,335
Sue very very surprised

1523
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
About what

1524
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
He knew and did inside of it

1525
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:07,295
That smell be fascinating because he's already said some pretty bad stuff

1526
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,575
Public

1527
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
NN I'm being careful confidential depositions that will become public at the moment

1528
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,327
But there are Robert Jacobsen is good

1529
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,655
Testify by deposition that's going to be a very surprising

1530
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
Deposition for a lot of people

1531
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,239
The other is I know a lot of

1532
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,287
People know from The Saga

1533
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,103
Infowars reporter

1534
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
Nobody's interest Crockett

1535
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
Yeah I'm believe me that

1536
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Barry

1537
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
Entertaining

1538
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
They did

1539
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
They did

1540
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,583
Wow and I'm tell you I hope that does becoming a fully public cuz we're going to be playing but the entire thing

1541
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,655
Thing is as rewarding as you might expect it

1542
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
It is

1543
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
Really something

1544
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
To see that man

1545
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:04,639
He's a police officers dream because you ask him one question the answers

1546
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,431
Sex offender

1547
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
Getting stuck by God from seeing some of his interviews that he did back when he worked it in

1548
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
Infowars it seems like

1549
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Out this guy I'll talk

1550
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
Another

1551
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
Another surprise guest will be a dawn Salazar

1552
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,559
Nobody

1553
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
I don't want Salazar

1554
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:29,983
Is one of the chief Riders at Infowars on Sandy Hook still like a major

1555
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,055
Figure they're I don't know if I've ever seen his face

1556
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Exactly

1557
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,639
The theater for a little while

1558
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,967
And then once we mentioned it he stopped for her guts up Twitter

1559
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,807
So there was something sneaky going on there but

1560
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,903
I don't want to see this because like you know

1561
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,231
I don't want to put this on you at all because my personal perception of him

1562
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
Is he seems like a s*******

1563
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
I don't know if

1564
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
The deposition will

1565
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,191
Will color my feelings at all but he seems like one of the worst

1566
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,751
I will describe him or in terms that the

1567
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,567
Describe

1568
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:09,151
Deeply irresponsible and malicious journalists at every step

1569
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,455
That is so diplomatic

1570
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,063
And then the last sort of surprised that they will be is

1571
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
But our case

1572
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,375
Broke down in tears for what he did

1573
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,655
42r self

1574
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
Bye to your phone

1575
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:36,287
He is going to be appearing as Lafferty

1576
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
She was also

1577
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
From there

1578
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Do we have a lot of people and we'll have a lot of people at trial

1579
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,527
We have experts to fully disclose so I don't mind telling you

1580
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
True that we're going to have

1581
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Fred's

1582
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:56,511
Longtime editor of the Austin Statesman testify about journalism and the standards of care he's now University of Texas

1583
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:02,143
We'll have Becca Lewis who thing is our Twitter

1584
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,703
One of the foremost

1585
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,519
Tom batters of misinformation out there

1586
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,079
Top-notch a media researcher

1587
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
Define a lot about

1588
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,663
Spread of invoice message

1589
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,759
Also have the therapist use treated

1590
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,807
Onion Scarlett's Instagram Sandy Hook

1591
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:25,951
And as well as a doctor who is a forensic psychologist you is

1592
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,511
Published in the field of denial of trauma

1593
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
And he's going to talk

1594
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
The variety of enforcing Floyd's

1595
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
I'm so it's going to be

1596
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:42,079
You know a lot of people were kind of worried coming into this if it just being a damaged how are you going to get the full measure what happen

1597
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
Absolutely will

1598
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,175
That we're going to be going through the entire story

1599
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:52,575
Everything kind of deprived of the

1600
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Dial itself

1601
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,231
You know there is a need perhaps for the jury that's exciting these damages to have

1602
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,511
Some of that

1603
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,815
I am in this contact

1604
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
16 Oak

1605
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
If you talking about like what

1606
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,959
What you're saying a number for the damages he should

1607
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,519
Have an appreciation for what the damage

1608
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:17,919
That was Don what you know stating for their arms to the plane

1609
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,735
Do also be awarded punitive damages

1610
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,063
4 to address the wanton malicious conduct

1611
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,391
And it doing that to have to really consider how bad was it

1612
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
Yeah we're going to need to do a deep dive

1613
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,743
Do what they do when they do it

1614
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
And I think

1615
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
You know even for knowledge fight listeners

1616
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,631
I think it's going to be deeply surprising for them

1617
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,679
Dashew volume

1618
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
That they

1619
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
Subject with

1620
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
Yeah I'm out that they tormented people

1621
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
Nmd the absolute

1622
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,151
Ava T of knowing

1623
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,479
What they did was wrong that the people they were talking to her crazy

1624
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,831
It's very shocking story in one place

1625
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,159
You don't even for me somebody who's

1626
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:05,279
Pretty well-versed in this when I came down for the deposition seeing some of the materials

1627
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
Was pretty surprising for me

1628
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,935
Like I can be as cynical as the next guy and for me there was even a

1629
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,775
I want to see benefit of the doubt but there was a

1630
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:21,151
I I don't want to assume the worst until you know you see some information some of the

1631
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,503
I guess some of that is public as it was in those depositions but like

1632
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:31,135
Who is Wolfgang halbig emails some of the the indications of awareness of things

1633
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,463
It was pretty eye-opening in its you know I assume there's a lot more

1634
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,535
There is a lot of surprises to come

1635
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:42,911
And I'm it's going to be quite a show let me ask let me ask you a question here

1636
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,447
You're talking about surprises

1637
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,239
You talking about Infowars employee

1638
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,823
Dude where you able to track down

1639
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:55,455
Batman Jakari Jackson or my gal Lee Ann McAdoo

1640
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,271
They're the old Ivory people

1641
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
My friend

1642
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,391
I have searched high and low I have uncovered

1643
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,183
And I must report to you

1644
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,255
But they are like the Snows of yesteryear

1645
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Gone from this Earth

1646
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,375
Well you know I guess

1647
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,447
Will you know it may be best to let them let the

1648
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:22,591
Actually I think we're involved in all this

1649
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:28,991
Lien has not made much of a video

1650
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,575
You know like there's just going to be videos of her and Rob do

1651
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
Talking about some of the most vile stuff is Super Bowl choir was actually the bird

1652
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Children

1653
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
I mean

1654
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:46,911
Yeah I remember that from some of the time I was going back over that that period of their content yes

1655
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,703
Yeah it was a little disappointed

1656
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
Well as lockers appointee

1657
01:14:54,847 --> 01:15:00,735
Yeah it's going to be I mean obviously I don't want to say this is going to be fun because it's not but it will not

1658
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,527
I can tell you that

1659
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,831
It will be cathartic

1660
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,367
And

1661
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,439
In and very interesting to see how it plays out

1662
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:14,047
I heard you say that he was going to have for the show so you can come try

1663
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:20,447
Let's see if he does that let's see if he does that be Barnes that he's thinking about Susan

1664
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:28,895
And it's like literally Alex Jones Roatan

1665
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:33,247
David Barnes botched the case and please don't do XOXO

1666
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
We got rid of bards

1667
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,463
What a stupid show well I mean the code the code for that is Barnes botched the case

1668
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,839
Which I wanted him to do and now I'm blaming him in a meaningless way

1669
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,143
Ever done is a light

1670
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,679
It's just disgusting

1671
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,983
How much they just Levi

1672
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,311
The courts really do believe it's true that like

1673
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:08,831
Stay away from

1674
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
Get that whatever

1675
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:17,279
Right

1676
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,143
Cost of these things like if you don't show up in that courtroom to face me bad what the

1677
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,311
Yeah

1678
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
He just for that for the

1679
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,479
But if he doesn't show up

1680
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,015
Yeah

1681
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,855
4 years to look at man in the face in the courtroom and say you're going to take

1682
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,927
He doesn't do that

1683
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,207
What kind of man is he

1684
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
Yeah that's something that gets really lost it and I think it's intentional in the way that Alex discusses the k-select

1685
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
How he's so jammed up and how it's like

1686
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
A show trial for him in like

1687
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,775
The reality is

1688
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
Him trying to invalidate

1689
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:08,223
All of this is invalidating the family's right to have their day in court

1690
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,319
And the flip side of that is that would also be his day in court

1691
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:18,207
I like to even further emphasize what this means for the families

1692
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,279
Right and I don't I don't mean to be overdramatic sure

1693
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
Is that

1694
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:27,423
When you have a plate of who is his actual injury when doing him and Scarlett actual injury

1695
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,727
Is the denial of their trauma

1696
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
Great is the denial

1697
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
Bendy Vindication of a jury verdict

1698
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,639
Is not just about Justice it is

1699
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:39,967
Medically necessary

1700
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:45,087
They need to have the smoke they need to have

1701
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:50,463
A public Reckoning birds recognize their son was real this was bulshit what he did to them was bulshit

1702
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,863
Like this needs to stop being the Legacy to be how they've indicated the legacy of their child not

1703
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,447
Yeah

1704
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
That doesn't really happen

1705
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,055
They can never heal like this trials not even

1706
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,615
That's his most important function

1707
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:14,783
I'm going to get a lot of these parents if he doesn't come in there and face

1708
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,671
The antidote to that negation is affirmation

1709
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
You know

1710
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
On some level yeah

1711
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:30,399
Well I guess I don't want to keep you all night so cuz we could talk some quite a while

1712
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,799
There is there any other like important points you want to you want to get across to her

1713
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,663

1743
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
