1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
We're couple to stay around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones Jordan

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
How do you feel about internet

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
Do you root for the United

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,344
You know like in the Olympics

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
Thrilled when United

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
As well especially

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Camaraderie

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
Crushing other countries

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Actually feel what it does

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
Don't feel like War but I remember when I was younger

12
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
I guess

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,152
I don't know what years it would have been but it was around like tarryall and

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,320
I'd like the French World Cup team

15
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
I don't know why my brother was

16
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
The French

17
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,744
Took a little bit by osmosis

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Then I studied French

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
I always had

20
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
Little little connection

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Francophile

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
I could cheer for them even if they were again

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Could see myself

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
Endorsing another

25
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
I'm not

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
Is USA or bust guys but I also appreciate

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
I know you're bringing this up because the woman's congratulations

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Congratulation

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Oh yeah

30
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
I remember I don't watch

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Football at all

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Okay

33
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
2015

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Like it was

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Intense

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Ever since that I watch

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
S*** out of women

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
I would say

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
This is a little bit

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,424
Sucked up to

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Probably the sport I watch most

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Does pro wrestling

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,384
None of her wrestling anymore or regularly but

44
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
The little amount of other sports I watch the eclipse by

45
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
I don't know if there's a ton of international competition

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Pro wrestling

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
Iran vs. Saudi Arabia thing was

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,704
Well played poorly done the Guthrie

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
There's a lot about today

50
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
International competition

51
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Not so much

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
Jordans

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
Sting episode to go over we are going to be talking about July

54
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
5th 2019

55
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Very clearly

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
I've gotten a lot of feedback

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
From listeners

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Expressing

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
A sentiment that

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
This is too much Alex Jones in a row

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
We need a Wacky Wednesday break I empathize I understand

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
Absolutely I understand that and I feel

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
I absolutely do

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
One of the consideration

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
So is that going on now

66
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
World right now

67
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
What are the other issues is

68
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Pizza X.

69
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Like if I check in on some

70
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Something is

71
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Wednesday thing

72
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Come to like 2 hours

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Somebody talked

74
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
2 hours lost

75
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,152
A bunch

76
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
It's very difficult to

77
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
That stuff in

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
Today is a modern-day Alex episode

79
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
But it'll be also a hybrid

80
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
Wacky Wednesday

81
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,559
I think that will be satisfying for some people

82
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Jordan

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
Michelle

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
I really appreciate it and I completely forgot

85
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,711
To give any shadowfell the last night so we're behind

86
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Thank you so much

87
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Next Spencer thank you so much

88
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
Text

89
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Zach

90
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,407
Exactly

91
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
Somebody donated on an elevated

92
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Appreciate it very much

93
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
Drew

94
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Heroin

95
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Is freakishly large

96
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
If you're out there listening

97
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Is button supposed to show weird

98
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,671
July 29th

99
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
Alex and predict

100
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,143
Did that antifa was going to commit chemical warfare against

101
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
All manner of

102
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
Conservative hammer out there with your kids they're going to Blind

103
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Magical milkshake

104
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,759
We're recording this on Sunday and there was a whole weekend of nonsensical bullshits or something pops off tonight

105
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:20,159
Don't blame us for not knowing about it

106
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
At all

107
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Surprising

108
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
So he's got a kind of pick a different

109
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
Kind of ignores that that was a

110
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
Legitimate prediction and

111
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
And so instead of focusing on how wrong

112
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
He was

113
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Decide

114
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
I am going to

115
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
To go f****** hard

116
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
About how great

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Which was

118
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
On the 4th

119
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
The theme that's going to develop throughout this Epic

120
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
2019 I'm your host Alex Jones

121
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
Trump speech live

122
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
It was

123
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
The confirmation

124
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,159
I'm just how far we're going is a culture

125
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
America

126
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
Demoralize us

127
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,983
Very Americana Pure Western Renaissance moment

128
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
I'm so honored

129
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
Free

130
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Turtle Trader

131
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Be able to do

132
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
36

133
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Picking off next Wednesday

134
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
Call Sweetie

135
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Proof

136
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
Okay so I guess there is still a little bit

137
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,967
It certainly D escalated

138
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,831
Have you heard this

139
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:30,719
It was an exorcism

140
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,327
Yeah it's kind of a vibe that Alex is going to be putting out as B

141
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Trump was

142
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Presiding over a suit

143
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
I'm sort of a

144
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Pseudo pagan

145
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,359
Christian ritual in order to exercise the anti-American forces

146
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Really f***** up

147
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
If you consider like

148
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
If you just take a step back if you forget about the fact

149
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Alex

150
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Had the career he's had

151
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,671
Presumably someone who's red thing up here saying Trump is doing magic

152
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Strip away all the other stuff.

153
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Alright man

154
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
In that regard

155
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Really does agree with

156
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Getzen trumpet

157
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
He's up there to imagine

158
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,823
I think the truck will probably not believe it is literally is Alex's birthday

159
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,199
I don't know man

160
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Who knows

161
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Sew-ins next Club Alex

162
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Believes

163
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
Melania

164
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
That this was a magical ritual

165
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Conducting

166
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Super emotional

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Oh boy

168
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
That's

169
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
What's the weather

170
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Show cameras

171
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Kosher up on Melania Trump's face

172
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Anita's

173
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Trump almost broke down crying

174
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
On

175
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Fire

176
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
She did get lit on

177
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
And

178
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
Americana and Country

179
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
Christian America

180
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Crocheting

181
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Globalist

182
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,975
Like I watch some of the videos that Alex was wanting to or is that there is about to cry

183
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Looks confused

184
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
What does the Rorschach

185
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
He almost crying

186
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,007
I can see some down in

187
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
It's all kind of similar visually

188
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,383
Angelic

189
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Beauty and

190
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
In love

191
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
America

192
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
I think of a woman who wore a jacket

193
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Said I don't

194
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
On the back of it

195
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Right that's what I think

196
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,023
Nothing is more Godly but not giving a s*** about the death of the poor

197
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Might think that is

198
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
America's Best

199
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,471
Sure that he might not be internally

200
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
I can find no evidence

201
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
I'm crying

202
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
There might have been some it appeared

203
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Tears without

204
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Might have been the wrong

205
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Yeah

206
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Yorkie before the clip start you said this is

207
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
I agree

208
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Narrative

209
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Is all religion

210
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Just ritual

211
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Sit into his audience

212
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
Not a power trip

213
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Someone

214
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
I saw Trump

215
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
President

216
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
With his wife

217
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
First to

218
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Perform

219
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
This is crazy on a couple

220
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,455
Reporting an exorcism

221
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
It's crazy is that it's now being reported at 6

222
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
So not only is it a magical ritual

223
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
Especially on the 5th it up pretty good way

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
You could deposit it to be reported

225
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,311
And now everybody globalist

226
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Show me one

227
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
In person

228
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
I don't know if she's a global

229
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
I mean

230
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Why do I protest

231
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Alex

232
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
It's talking about

233
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Being View

234
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Horses that need exercise

235
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
This is probably the only point of the episode

236
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
That I think is like

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
This isn't what I want to cover

238
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
The rest is going to be really fun

239
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,663
But he's got to yell about like drag queen story time at Pride Parade a little bit

240
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Because of a

241
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Specific things

242
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
He's saying

243
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
About them

244
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Push back on a little bit

245
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
Otherwise it would just be like

246
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Scores of articles with them

247
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
Children are mounted on top

248
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
The man

249
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
What

250
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Videos and photos of this

251
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
Children

252
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,503
Just making this up

253
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,879
Sponsored

254
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
Other than I don't really defense

255
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Bright real

256
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
Formal structure to it at all your might actually be somebody

257
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
That might actually exist

258
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
They don't have a CFO I'll tell you that right now or not

259
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
So

260
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Group kids at

261
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
True

262
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
I'm at was wondering where you was getting a

263
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Videos and photos of this

264
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
In Europe they have sex with the children in public

265
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
Openly having sex with Rebellion

266
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Really don't think

267
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
You don't I really don't think that's true

268
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Side mirrors f***

269
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Can kids outside

270
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
Completely made up Hangouts

271
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Did you community

272
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
It's become incredibly

273
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:41,311
Common occurrence on this show to hear Alex a street like this but just completely not true

274
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Refreshing

275
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Pensive nonetheless because

276
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Scale

277
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Houses for people talking points

278
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,295
From the far right to your campaign.

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Coming out of Europe

280
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Which diesel

281
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,415
The director against the lgbtq community

282
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
This traces back to backlash

283
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
The pride parade held in Warsaw

284
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,167
And as we discussed in the episode where recovered Stefan molyneux gone to Poland

285
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,311
Warsaw in Poland is not the chillest place in the world right now for non-heterosexual white dude

286
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,431
Jaroslawkuzniar the head of the law and Justice party and the power behind the Polish president

287
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
The moment has labeled the lgbtq

288
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
Q Rights Movement a foreign import into threat

289
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
Wright's just before the pride parade of far-right journalist

290
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
From Poland called

291
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
People to

292
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
On lgbtq

293
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Atq active

294
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
That's not good but he was quick to point out that he didn't mean it literally and then he compare Pride Parade organizers organizers

295
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
According to the independent quotes

296
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
Town Council

297
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
I'm staying at their municipality is LGB

298
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Free in recent

299
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
There is a real

300
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Negative friend

301
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,623
From a political perspective right now

302
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,719
Some articles that I've read and information I found

303
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
The population is

304
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Towards greater except

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
And support for LGBT

306
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,447
Horse backlash from the far-right ruling party

307
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
Part of that backlash has been attacking Warsaw mayor Russell

308
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
For participating in the Warsaw

309
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
A saying quote

310
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
Not everyone has to go to equality parade

311
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Respect minority rights

312
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
It's really important

313
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
For me that works I'll be open

314
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Warsaw be tolerant

315
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
That is a sentiment that isn't direct opposition

316
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Far-right agenda

317
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
And so to attack the rising

318
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Tide of public acceptance of LGBT

319
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
AcuRite they've launched a public campaign

320
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Portrayed quality

321
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Is actually being an attack on families

322
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
An attempt

323
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Actualize children

324
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
So weird

325
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Across the world from Warsaw to Austin

326
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Coming up with you today

327
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Mirza narrative

328
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,039
Almost working out of the exact same Playbook

329
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Please or were they not

330
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Secretly the whole

331
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,559
I want to write a blog about it

332
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
March for Life and the family was held

333
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
830 Townsend Paula

334
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,799
The March has been held in previous years to protest abortion but this year was co-opted by the

335
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Ddlg

336
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
EQ momentum

337
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
And it made it

338
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Quote protect

339
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
Children for premature sexualisation

340
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
All of this is absolutely with Alex's lying about and embellishing what he says

341
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
The mayor of Europe was having sex

342
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Two children in the sky

343
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
That is how it snowing in his audience is full of jump

344
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Who will accept his version

345
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
The story when in reality

346
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
The mayor of Warsaw Justice

347
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
Expressed support for the pride parade

348
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
That is what he's embellishing and lying about

349
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
And this is why I never accept those arguments the people make that it's like

350
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
I was just an over-the-top.

351
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
Truth

352
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:00,991
You wakes you up out of your Slumber by being hyperbolic

353
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Sex with children

354
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,879
In Europe what he is embellishing is a mayor expressing

355
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Support for a pride parade

356
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
That is not leading you to the truth that is lead

357
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
You towards accepting

358
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Far-right

359
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Fascists mirrors

360
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Coming out of Europe in service

361
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Dehumanizing

362
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Legitimizing and oppressing

363
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
Lgbtq individuals who are just trying to

364
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
Except

365
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Except

366
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Not a trivial issue

367
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
No sew

368
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
For Alex's sodas

369
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
No no

370
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Mexico

371
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Alex gets back to talking about how true

372
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Trump's 4th of July speech

373
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Mcgonigle's office

374
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
The ritual

375
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
What

376
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
He knows

377
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
What rituals

378
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Bucket was

379
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Solutely

380
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
That they're attacking it

381
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
It just really shows

382
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
Crystal clear

383
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
Fourth of July special

384
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
The last few days

385
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,343
Is hyperbolic in order to wake people up

386
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Complete bulshit

387
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,975
Hyperbolic about exaggerating

388
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Which is

389
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,351
They want to f*** your kids then turns around and uses as an

390
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Introduction

391
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
For his sales pitch about why

392
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Existing to fight back against this imaginary.

393
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
Exaggerated

394
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
To make you scared

395
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
To figure out

396
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
If you would just pay attention

397
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Into the structure of his show

398
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Now

399
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
What are the things about Alex Knows Alot About You

400
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,072
Call history so

401
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
He knows a lot about real

402
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm trying to find a better way to phrase

403
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Going to have to let it slide

404
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
Hear the lovely imagination I would like to imagine is the last getting mad about

405
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Unfortunately

406
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
He doesn't understand

407
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
What the thing

408
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
But he thinks

409
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
It's pretty clearly damaged

410
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
How much they love

411
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
The demoralisation of the people

412
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
Call him

413
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,720
It's really funny that Alex thinks at The Battle Hymn of the Republic

414
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Is somehow going to trigger Libs

415
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:29,120
Or that it's a distorted version of Christianity or even American history

416
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,472
The song itself is just a new set of lyrics

417
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
61 etcetera

418
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
Preexisting tune from the song John Brown's Body

419
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,408
Which itself is based on a folk song these precise origins or a matter of.

420
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
Dispute Scholars have argued that it has its roots

421
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
African-American community

422
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Pre-civil War South

423
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
Do you mean like most music

424
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,768
Brown body and Battle Hymn of the Republic are strongly abolitionist

425
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Songs

426
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
John Brown's Body was dumped exclusively by Union soldier

427
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
And it was decidedly

428
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Confederacy

429
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
Is evidenced by the lyrics

430
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,312
They will hang us our apple tree

431
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
Now three rousing cheers for the Union

432
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,968
Free over

433
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
We're not still singing the song it's like working

434
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,512
Battle Hymn of the Republic was written by Julia Ward

435
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Someone who

436
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,400
Would absolutely have called dub if you was around in the

437
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
300

438
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
She was decidedly a dedicated abolition

439
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
Specifically to give a more cleaned-up version of John Brown's Body

440
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Rally the Union Army

441
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
To defeat the Confederacy

442
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,736
After the Civil War how dedicated herself to

443
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
The battle for women

444
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
Suffrage putting her squarely on the right side of a

445
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
History on two important issues

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Suppertime

447
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,952
Though her version was a little bit less overt

448
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
I didn't include part about

449
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Confederate President Jefferson Davis

450
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
It was still pretty clearly antique

451
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Confederate

452
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
One person particular stands out

453
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
Quote in the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea

454
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
With a glory in his bosom the transfigures you and me

455
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free

456
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Well God is marching

457
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,856
The only people who should be triggered by the playing of The Battle Hymn of the Republic are people like Alex

458
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Confederacy

459
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
This song is literally about killing his family members

460
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Who took up arms

461
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
To defend slavery

462
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,864
I don't think the people who don't know about the song histories with

463
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
That triggered by a deer

464
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,264
I feel like most people who don't really think about it all that much just kind of accepted as a patriotic classic

465
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
Tickets brought out every time we have in America fetishizing holiday

466
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Every

467
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
I think most people kind of it rolls off them like

468
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,880
Anybody who knows

469
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
These are

470
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Specifically

471
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
Abolitionist

472
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
I don't know kill the slave owner

473
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,424
Let's fuk up Alex's great-grandfather

474
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,360
Alex legitimately believe that he is his answer

475
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
He has that idea that like your ancestors live on

476
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
Confederate ancestors

477
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Is legitimately still trying to kill him

478
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Through it anybody

479
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Yeah

480
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
Absolutely that's the only

481
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
And because he

482
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
The wounds

483
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
It still be fresh absolutely

484
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
He's still bitter about that

485
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
So I don't know I think

486
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
He's just talking s*** about the Battle Hymn of the Republic

487
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
That is par for the course

488
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
The next clip

489
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
Alex gets really we

490
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
Eclipse are really enjoyed

491
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
This is

492
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Adding a new layer

493
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
To his past

494
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
Make salmon

495
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Into just a pickle

496
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,424
I've never really I don't think I've heard him bring this up before

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
I think he might have brought this up

498
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:22,592
I think this is just a wreck

499
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Would be

500
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Bugger

501
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Crazy wild

502
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
You are

503
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
And they never even

504
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Tony hillerman

505
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
And then later it happens

506
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,576
Oprah Winfrey

507
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Providence

508
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Bloodline

509
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
What wars

510
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
God put forward

511
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Future

512
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
If you saying that cause and effect exist

513
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
I guess I agree with

514
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
But the part that's really strange

515
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
To me is that what you expressing

516
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Is this from

517
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
The age of Ariana

518
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Right

519
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
Which I don't believe at all

520
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
I don't believe that at all would not be so full of

521
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Complete

522
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,216
Ninety-degree turns down bizarre Road

523
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,568
I didn't tell you what the passes looked like that I guess so

524
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Which again

525
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Makes no sense

526
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
It doesn't

527
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
No sense because of God is already

528
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Preordained

529
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
It doesn't matter what

530
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
You don't have any

531
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Control

532
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
But stupid

533
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Alex talked more about how the trumps were

534
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
During the speech

535
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
And again I just have to stress

536
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
No evidence

537
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
I do not

538
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
Right

539
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,552
Alex

540
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
Trembling

541
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:47,232
Spirit

542
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
This is just turning like

543
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Trumpet

544
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
This is almost like an attempt

545
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
2

546
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,064
Deify

547
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
For a long time

548
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
It's so over its

549
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Vainly

550
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,024
Make it this attempt to do

551
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,096
Inexorably thai-american Providence

552
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
What it means to be patriotic

553
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
This

554
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Singular executive

555
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Right

556
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
To be against metallic

557
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Attempts to Saint

558
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
And for

559
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
But who knows

560
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
The 2nd

561
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
His

562
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
1576

563
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,672
Americana

564
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
If I know anything

565
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
So

566
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
On this episode one of his big

567
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Narrative

568
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
Very convoluted and I don't really care about is

569
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Is that he was

570
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,472
Looking at responses

571
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
2 Trump speech

572
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
He saw the

573
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Media come out with a bunch

574
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Huh. Trump stupid

575
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
But

576
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Pieces were immediately

577
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,624
Down because the media realize they were going to come out with us

578
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,744
No one liked it so they doubled back I don't I don't know that this is

579
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
I have no way

580
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Confirm or deny this

581
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,680
I think what Alex is talking about is other people posted

582
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
Like

583
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Stream

584
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Or rebroadcast

585
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Like CNN

586
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
MSNBC

587
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
Copyright

588
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
That's what I'm guessing

589
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
He's talking about

590
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Sure

591
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
He's not

592
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Specific enough that there's any

593
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Threads I can

594
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Can pull

595
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
And I don't care

596
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Completely made

597
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
Right but

598
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
Part and parcel of this narrative is it the reason that they ended up

599
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Taking all these

600
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
Because the back

601
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
From the Patriots

602
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
And the good American

603
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Strong

604
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
If you're wondering how Alex

605
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Not very good

606
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Attacks with headlines

607
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
Publix

608
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Comment

609
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Comment on the one that quickly

610
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
If you are gay

611
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,304
Public sentiment

612
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
Good

613
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
That's that's that's the Acropolis of our time

614
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Suggest

615
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,568
That if you had better information

616
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
You wouldn't use you

617
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
You comments for Smitty's garage

618
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,224
I don't know

619
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Not very serious people

620
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
Cherry pick YouTube comments in order to

621
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Is a dam

622
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Valic

623
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Does process

624
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
And what he considers relevant in

625
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Information

626
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
If you think so that YouTube comments or somehow worth of being apart of it

627
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Discussion

628
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
I think

629
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
I don't know it's just embarrassing

630
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
If he wasn't playing

631
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Games

632
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
He didn't have an audio

633
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,856
If we did that we would be pilloried

634
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,256
Not if you cited as one of your sources, everyone would

635
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Beautiful

636
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
Specific everybody hates

637
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,264
Trump and here's why I believe that

638
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
S***

639
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Suggest when he says that he watched

640
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
Dozens and dozens of YouTube videos

641
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
And look at the comments

642
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
It's more like he

643
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Went to dozens of videos

644
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Without watching

645
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
I don't even know what

646
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,904
It does not matter to me

647
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
YouTube

648
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Yeah

649
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,304
But you know is that he was watching it may or may not have been taken

650
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
They were expressing

651
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
A real hatred

652
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Now it wasn't just

653
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
They're also article

654
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Besides the cover

655
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Fox reporter

656
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
Us would have been better off

657
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
That's

658
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,752
Don't celebrate Fourth of July by Cindy American Revolution was a mistake

659
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Every reporter

660
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
BuzzFeed

661
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Looks like this

662
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
He's got a face that's more

663
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Full screen

664
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Sir

665
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Good analysis

666
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
So far

667
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
Right photos

668
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
Of other writer on July 4th

669
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,136
How much America stock

670
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Alex is going really hard after Fox reporter Dylan math

671
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,824
Complete

672
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
This is pretty weak stuff

673
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
Yeah yeah

674
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,064
The article that Alex is responding to someone that Dylan wrote

675
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,464
The article was updated this year

676
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Apparently

677
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Alex just

678
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,656
Enough justification to report on a four-year-old article that was written and published

679
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
As if it's somehow a recent thing

680
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
World Cups

681
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
We're all good together

682
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,896
Dillon's argument comes down to three points

683
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,992
Just why staying with the British Empire outcome

684
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
The first is that slavery would have been abolished

685
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
At this is not a debatable point

686
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,024
England abolished slavery before the American Revolution except

687
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,328
Before with India following along

688
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
1843

689
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
The Emancipation Proclamation didn't formally abolished slavery in the United

690
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
65

691
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
I'm sure Alex would probably say who cares about

692
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
22 years of

693
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Non slavery but I think that's a pretty dumb argument

694
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,688
Dylan's first point is absolutely correct

695
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,576
If we were still in the British Empire slavery would have been outlawed sooner and possibly even without a civil war being needed

696
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
The second argument

697
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,440
Cuz there's conflict

698
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Violence between the colonists

699
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
And Native American

700
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
It would have been far less horrible

701
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Buy the part of the

702
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
The British Empire

703
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Dylan's not paint inversion

704
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Of what wood

705
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Possibly

706
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,104
Pointing out that the ethnic cleansing that took place in our early history

707
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Was the direct result of an inch

708
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Satiable hunger for Western

709
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,760
Which the British set limits on what their proclamation of 7

710
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
B3

711
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
It's hard to know exactly how

712
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
Things would have played out but if you look back at what are independent country

713
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
The native peoples

714
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
It does make you feel

715
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
A little bit

716
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
It's possible it's possible

717
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,912
Play some point you're arguing a counterfactual that's always very difficult imagine possible worlds

718
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
We're thinking

719
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
About there

720
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
In terms of

721
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
The Dominos

722
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
You cannot make

723
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,992
That's why they're still fighting people still would have been violent towards each other

724
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
Possibly the Trail of Tears

725
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
Possibly reservations wouldn't

726
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Uno's

727
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
Texas

728
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
System of government

729
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Is more stable than what we have,

730
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,400
Parliamentary systems he says are less likely to collapse into dictatorships

731
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
Since they lack of focus on a singular Authority

732
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Which characterizes

733
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Presidential

734
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
He further points out the Parliamentary

735
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
Systems generally experience less gridlock

736
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
And legislation

737
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,712
I can be generally

738
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Much easier that's her

739
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
Nervous system as opposed to our conflict based

740
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
System

741
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
Often ends up

742
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
Situation where one side want something one side wants

743
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
The opposite of something

744
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
And no one can make

745
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Any Headway

746
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Complete gridlock

747
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
Agree or disagree with Dylan Matthews point it's not fair to say that

748
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
America from the text

749
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
This article

750
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
It's one thing to dispute his premises

751
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
It's entirely another to accuse him of being

752
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Because you don't want

753
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
Engage with his ideas

754
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,688
Then do a little segment on your show where you call an ugly and apply to the danger to children

755
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Childish

756
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
But it's no surprise

757
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Absolute

758
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,624
Dillon's article was originally published on July 2nd twenty

759
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
And on July 7th 2015

760
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,256
Books published a response article with the headline quote

761
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,816
No the American Revolution was not a mistake

762
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,656
In this article Jeff Stein does exactly what Alex Jones

763
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
Incapable of doing

764
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Taking Dillon's points

765
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Considering them

766
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
And express

767
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Counterpoint

768
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
But he feels makeup better

769
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
Surprisingly not once

770
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,432
Call Dylan ugly

771
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:20,576
Doesn't respond to this ugly do so little

772
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,928
Do the American Revolution was a good idea get a load of this guy

773
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Fox publish both of these articles because

774
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
They both bring up interesting perspective on his

775
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
They both use primary source

776
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,168
Does the defender different views on how things would have been different if the United States

777
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Hadn't declared

778
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Vox published both

779
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,848
These articles not because they hate America but because their media Outlets that are interested

780
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
The publishing

781
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Incontact

782
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,248
In contrast to that Infowars is a media Outlet interested in publishing content based on

783
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
Personal insults

784
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
Making s*** up and lying about headline

785
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
The difference

786
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Could not be

787
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
It's really it's really interests

788
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Especially within the context of these

789
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Dum Dums

790
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
That's all I do like

791
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
Dangerous

792
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Ideas you guys can

793
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Existed

794
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
In the marketplace of ideas and debate our ideas

795
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,288
I want to talk about a four-year-old Vox article

796
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,592
They themselves published

797
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
A response

798
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
To from another author Wendell was a debate

799
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,992
Between the two like these articles are not just

800
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,576
Articles that exist for like a guy made this point in

801
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
Completely unrelated another guy made

802
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
Different

803
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
Just Times article is it Direct

804
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Fonts to Dylan Matthews article

805
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,840
There is an interplay that's happening.

806
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Within a meteor

807
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Thought source

808
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Thinkbox is allowing

809
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
These ideas to be

810
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Be discussed

811
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Interact with each other

812
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
For public consumption

813
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,504
That is a Marketplace of ideas American Revolution

814
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
It was good

815
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,832
And in fact I just agree with some of your points

816
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Here's why I disagree with this point

817
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
That is

818
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
What Alex and his

819
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Dickhole friend

820
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
Pretend they want to do

821
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
In reality

822
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
To do is save these people are bunch of globalist fux

823
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,704
They called him ugly and then applied at they want to hurt your kids

824
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
And that make money

825
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Off of doing

826
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
That's what is it called

827
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Free-speech advocates

828
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,664
Get on the right all they really want

829
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Is to be wrong

830
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Loudly

831
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
And never have

832
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
They don't want any

833
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
They don't want any kind of

834
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Learning

835
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
Possibility they don't want any

836
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
They want to be able to stay

837
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Say what they want to say

838
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Hwoarang

839
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
How racist are you stupid

840
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Without ever having

841
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Exactly

842
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Jordan

843
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Open text

844
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,496
You since yesterday

845
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Telling you that

846
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
I found

847
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Grounding

848
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Completely

849
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Game Change

850
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
The game will be

851
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
This is also

852
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Going into where we reach the point of the episode where things

853
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
Take a little bit of a fever

854
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Wednesday

855
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
Okay

856
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
It's coming

857
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,215
Studios

858
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
This is a guy who's Italian

859
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,663
He pretends about the Vatican

860
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,455
Hanging out with Leo zagami

861
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
And so

862
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
Decorative boxes right over there on that day

863
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
Well just affected Trump

864
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
Or the left

865
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,511
Good time to celebrate so I don't normally have

866
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
More

867
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
It keeps being like

868
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
I should have a third

869
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
That I rarely see

870
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Could have their glass

871
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Rude

872
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,463
Asian rude

873
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,791
The book called A confessions of an Illuminati

874
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Was

875
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:53,727
Maybe ghost written by Lego the blurb on Amazon

876
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
Because it's glorify Leo

877
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:04,479
Replaced

878
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Penis with

879
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
Super important Illuminati inside

880
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,207
I've listen to Leo zagami show up on Alex's show in the past

881
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,559
I've heard him even when he made an appearance I'll Project Camelot cuz he did

882
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
I have listened to him

883
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
And a lot of stuff that I was able to

884
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Define

885
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
You're my research today

886
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
East Knox

887
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
Stop that has ever come up

888
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
It is not stuff that Alex has

889
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Everett

890
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
Soffit to be like

891
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,943
Hey now I should tell you this about Leos

892
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,551
I cannot wait to tell you this is one of my favorite stories that I will ever tell on this podcast

893
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
And no matter how much I do this

894
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
I cannot

895
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
Over self

896
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
Alright you got a lot

897
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
So here's Leo just to talk

898
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
What would you call this historical timeline

899
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
We wear in Eatery distressed organization

900
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
Friends

901
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,191
I strongly believe that that is part of his

902
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Citi Trends

903
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,919
Confesses to a crime

904
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,159
We are

905
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:06,591
Jimmy Chino Airport

906
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
That's it

907
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,399
Illegally trafficked

908
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,495
If I understand correctly celebrating

909
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
Customs and Border Protection

910
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:43,711
Expensive

911
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,063
Dumbass I don't really care about that

912
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
B b of the Mind

913
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
Know why that the

914
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
Heavily controlled what I'm saying is I'm not calling

915
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
It's just hilarious

916
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
So you remember earlier when you were

917
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
Talking about how

918
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
At least

919
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Well Alex makes

920
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
Interesting

921
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Comment.

922
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,895
See it's funny because of all the stuff he said about Obama because she's married to a guy who

923
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,223
That was a birther

924
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,039
Alex doesn't really care about Aldi

925
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Itsfunneh

926
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
What is

927
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,927
Trump to be telling her what to do

928
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
So

929
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Alex

930
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Talking about how

931
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
Leo's

932
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
It's weird

933
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
And kind of uncomfortable and Italy

934
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,271
End the end

935
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
We talked about Leo zagami a little bit in the past

936
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,711
You popped up in our 2015 investigation as a complete weirdo

937
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
Except smartsound

938
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,039
Because he thinks anyone with an axe

939
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
Anyone who missed those episode

940
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
Leo zagami is whole thing is that he used to be in the Illuminati but now he's become a whistle-blower warning the world about there in the

941
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
Nefarious satanic play

942
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,447
He also apparently is a Vatican Insider which I guess just comes with the territory

943
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:18,847
If you're in with the Illuminati you probably get invited to some Vatican mixers a little cocktail hour at the Vatican

944
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,175
Yeah I assume you go to every place of power you know like

945
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
Basin

946
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,575
For sure for sure

947
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,647
She's running one of the simplest scams imagine

948
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:38,047
You can just make up whatever she wants and trick idiots has inside information about

949
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,863
On the flipside the Catholic Church

950
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Insanely corrupt organization

951
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
And people who protect

952
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
So there

953
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,543
Pretty easy also to make sure talk about

954
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Incredible

955
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
If you just put

956
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
A bunch of priests are going to be out of his abuser

957
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Even if you're making

958
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,783
Get up your prediction may come through

959
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
Safe game you play

960
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,951
Information about

961
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,767
Lupo's part no one really cares about him outside of

962
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,327
Coverage

963
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Comes from that

964
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
Perspective

965
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887
Super

966
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Critical and

967
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Pretty dicey

968
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
However

969
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
There is an amazing story

970
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Tippy Toe

971
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
And in order to

972
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
Conspiracy sites

973
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
You today is as close as I can get

974
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
To the actual true story

975
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
Sagami got to where he is today

976
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
And how we clearly demonstrate

977
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
How little research Alexandra

978
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
Do on somebody

979
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,303
Before they allow them to be presented as a credible guest

980
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
On their show

981
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,399
There isn't too much concrete

982
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Information

983
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,727
Should know about Leo zagami pre-2000

984
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,519
Really important

985
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,919
If you're going to make bulshit up about the Illuminati website

986
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,991
Record producer under the name Leo young until 2000

987
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063
At which point you decided to start exposing the Illuminati

988
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,463
His father was a professor of psychology named Elio zagami and his mother was Jessica Lange Young

989
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,815
Julio Legends is quote a member of the Queen Mother of England's family

990
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
Her middle name is literally like

991
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,679
That's who's the

992
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
That's apparently his father's

993
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
His maternal

994
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,527
He doesn't specify how he's related to the Queen Mother and predicting around

995
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
Inasmuch as I can

996
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
Relationship

997
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
The only reference is I can find to Jessica lion young be related to the Royal Family come from various websites that have re-posted

998
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
Leo self-written bio

999
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
Given the other things I know about him I strongly

1000
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
The fact he's making up his

1001
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,751
Leo's life story

1002
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,079
Up to going public Illuminati go something like

1003
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
He was born into a Scottish Sicilian Illuminati

1004
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Cretic bloodline

1005
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,271
And that sucks she's been apart of the Illuminati since

1006
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:14,207
As a lifelong member he was groomed as a prince of the Illuminati recently ranked 33rd degree of masonic

1007
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,511
Notorious Italian

1008
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
D2 LOD

1009
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Okay okay

1010
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Before you decided to expose the speaker

1011
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:26,495
Replace the previous King of the Illuminati that Leo was disgusted by the Satanism you was around

1012
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,823
And chose the path of light

1013
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Full line

1014
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,455
Okay this is an essential piece of his hero's journey

1015
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
He stood to inherit every

1016
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,039
Power in the world all the riches

1017
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
About the world

1018
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
He rejected at all

1019
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,023
To fact-check his story I should point out that the large you claim to be a part of

1020
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,327
But it also closed when Leo was 6 years old

1021
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Likely

1022
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,471
The only direct evidence he's ever provided of his membership in any Masonic Lodge

1023
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,519
Is a picture of his membership badge

1024
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
From Kirby Lodge

1025
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Twenty88

1026
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,687
It's important to understand about the Masons though is that they keep exhaustive Wrecker

1027
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
Their entire organization basically revolves around ritual

1028
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
A record-keeping is a part of the

1029
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,135
Including the record-keeping of course our reports

1030
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Where they kick people out

1031
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,303
Leo zagami was kicked out of Kirby Lodge

1032
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
For Behavioral problem

1033
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:27,167
Including but not limited to excessive use of profanity

1034
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
After that point you started

1035
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Just joining a bunch of fake Lodge

1036
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
I just don't even involved with the Masons

1037
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,359
To create the illusion that they are

1038
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,943
If you ever reach any high level of initiation anywhere

1039
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
It's in

1040
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
Fake Masonic lodges

1041
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Which seems on brand

1042
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,599
Are they are they are they

1043
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
More like

1044
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,463
Apostate Masonic lodges or they like a bunch of weekend dudes

1045
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,839
I think it varies

1046
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,911
Is either of those groups and I think there's even a third

1047
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
Cross-section that is like

1048
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,775
I want to be weirder than that

1049
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
Whatever I

1050
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Feel like

1051
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:12,479
Is Masonic isn't actually summer create my own Lodge

1052
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
Version of

1053
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Them

1054
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,207
So in 2008 Leo found himself living in Norway

1055
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,815
In March 2000

1056
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Search from a Norwegian politician

1057
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
What a dire warning

1058
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,727
The Norwegian government is building more and more underground bases

1059
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Isn't bunkers

1060
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
Planet X

1061
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:41,151
The people that are going to be left on the surface will die along with the others

1062
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Get no help whatsoever

1063
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,503
The planets are going

1064
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
And the rest will die

1065
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,903
All the governments in the world are aware of this is going to happen

1066
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
I assure you a hundred percent that things will happen

1067
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
There are four years to prepare for the end game

1068
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
Get weapons

1069
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
And make survival

1070
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
A place where you can be

1071
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,399
Be safe with food for a tie

1072
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
Okay so he was on

1073
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,823
Well this is from an alleged Norwegian politician

1074
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
The point out that at the time Leo zagami

1075
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Lived in Norway

1076
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
The politician offered to answer any question

1077
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
Jim Carrey might correspond

1078
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
It is messages

1079
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
He makes a number of predictions that do not come

1080
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:30,815
Come true

1081
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:39,007
She said that Steve Jansen would be elected prime minister of Norway

1082
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
Which didn't

1083
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
Oh okay

1084
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
Interesting Lee

1085
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:46,431
In February 2000

1086
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,991
So he was in place to be a valuable source

1087
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,807
To check in with about this letter from Norwegian

1088
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Politician

1089
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:58,975
And that's exactly what happened

1090
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,791
What's a bit more into this

1091
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:06,143
As it goes a lot there's something very suspicious going on

1092
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,495
Call Leo to interview in Valparaiso

1093
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
Politician whistleblower

1094
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Leo's

1095
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
Profile in

1096
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,663
Conspiracy world was raised dramatically in the span of a couple months

1097
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,967
Thanks to the project

1098
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
Project Camelot

1099
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,343
If you'll recall when we covered Jessica Shaw

1100
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,183
She specifically said that after she went on Project Camelot

1101
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
Came famous overnight

1102
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,071
Well it may seem like an irrelevant joke now project

1103
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Pretty large platform

1104
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Decade ago

1105
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,471
Will undoubtedly got a whole lot of tracks

1106
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
Future.

1107
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,871
On the show mixed up in the story of this alleged Norwegian politician

1108
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
A cynical mind might suggest

1109
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Kind of already have

1110
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:55,039
About pretty much everything

1111
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
It's likely that the letter was a bit of a stunt

1112
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,647
It may be the only person who stood to gain anything

1113
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
From that kind of stock was

1114
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,023
I have no idea though I can't prove it either way

1115
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:11,423
It could be an amazing coincidence that right after he got interviewed in Oslo for Project Camelot

1116
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,471
Is whistleblowing message from a Norwegian politic

1117
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
Because it was sent

1118
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,639
From El zagami at gmail.com

1119
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,479
Who else could send that

1120
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,063
After his appearance on Project Camelot Leo's wife

1121
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
I took their son

1122
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
It's very hard

1123
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
Determine what actually happened

1124
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,743
I'm here but I can tell you that I don't believe the version of the story

1125
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
Repeated ad nauseam

1126
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Conspiracy Cirque

1127
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,935
Hold on I'll just read to you from

1128
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Papers

1129
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
Which is written by someone who claims to be a

1130
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
Personal friend of Leo's

1131
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,359
Keep that in mind for later

1132
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Controversy papers

1133
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,503
Hold on to that.

1134
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,343
The Illuminati

1135
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Has accused him of spousal

1136
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:11,071
I don't I don't know if the accusation of domestic violence is even I don't know if it's true

1137
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
Wherever actually

1138
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,447
But I do know that I don't believe that his wife left because he was secretly

1139
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
The Illuminati

1140
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,311
David Icke pulled this exact

1141
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
2012

1142
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
When he divorced his second wife

1143
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
Pamela lyrics

1144
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Who he

1145
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,991
He decided they needed to split up after 11

1146
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
Years of marriage because he

1147
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,087
Became suspicious that she was a shapeshifter

1148
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
When intimacy deteriorates

1149
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,439
These people

1150
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:41,279
Always end up being secretly involved with their

1151
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Imagined enemies

1152
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,167
You can even see this with Alex Jones blurs the lines between the actions of the globalist

1153
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,775
And his ex-wife globalist want to take my kids away

1154
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
They used to be we just called witches and

1155
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
Is a simpler time for these

1156
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,431
What's interesting

1157
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
Is it Leo's

1158
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
First wife

1159
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Was Muslim

1160
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
In fact

1161
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
He repeatedly insist

1162
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
The Cheez-It Direct

1163
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,855
Descendant of Muhammad

1164
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
Do you know what else

1165
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
At that time

1166
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
Leo was Muslim as well

1167
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,279
In a message board post

1168
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
What

1169
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
In a message board post

1170
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,983
Leah wrote that his wife quotes that I should stop immediately my Illuminati confessions on the net and convert

1171
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,799
Restricted more fundamentalist view of Islam

1172
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
Otherwise she will leave me

1173
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
That was obviously a brainwashing in position

1174
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
For me and I couldn't accept such a

1175
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Proposal

1176
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
Okay

1177
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
Okay

1178
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Alright

1179
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Riveted first off

1180
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
Different play

1181
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,535
We will go onto later claimed that he converted to Islam infiltrate the religion

1182
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:51,935
He became a Muslim quote during an Illuminati ritual he made in Egypt under the Great Pyramid of Giza

1183
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,335
Illuminati religion

1184
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,663
Add a Muslim

1185
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,967
Khalid saifullah Khan

1186
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,807
If there's one thing that you learned about Leo zagami when you look into it

1187
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,671
It said he is a dude who has used a lot of different names in his career

1188
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
Generally

1189
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Don't like to have a good time

1190
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
That's why they don't do it

1191
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
So after his wife left

1192
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
He miraculously realized that the version of Islam

1193
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
And represented assist

1194
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
Afraid of Leo's

1195
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,455
Right but wasn't he inducted

1196
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Staying religion

1197
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Through the Illuminati

1198
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,183
Don't worry about trying to make this next to be out loud

1199
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
Similar problems with us

1200
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
So because

1201
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,839
His wife was involved

1202
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,887
Leo was punished

1203
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,935
By having his marriage broken up

1204
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
His child taken from her

1205
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,007
Awful

1206
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,799
What I know about Leo

1207
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,615
What we can learn about him and what we will learn about him

1208
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,407
Today

1209
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,199
I think he's a maniacal

1210
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:13,599
Who if not directly you might want a divorce from if you find yourself

1211
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
Accidentally married

1212
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
From his account of what happened

1213
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,023
In any case to weeks of not seeing my son Isaac

1214
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,375
I tried to put pressure on the religious movement of my wife in order to show me my son again

1215
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,447
But instead at 9:30 p.m. on the 4th of March

1216
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Two policemen

1217
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,055
Police woman came to my house and arrest me so I spent

1218
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
12 hours in a cold prison

1219
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:39,967
Translate Leo was harassing his wife's and she called the police and they responded appropriately

1220
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,575
What year was in prison for that difficult 12 hours he had a breakthrough

1221
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
When he met with a priest

1222
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:52,511
He found the strength to tell the priest about his quote forced conversion into Islam to please my wife's family and the way

1223
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
Play they sold me after the authorities

1224
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,607
As the only a true Judas could do

1225
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,935
Yes my wife told me to my worst enemy the Norwegian free maze

1226
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
So the conversion to Islam was both

1227
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,079
Who is by his wife religion

1228
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,639
I got it okay whatever

1229
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
Greatest enemy is the Norwegian the Freemasons the total

1230
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Serious

1231
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
That's fun

1232
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
Yep

1233
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Conveniently

1234
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,535
When he was arrested for that 12 hours

1235
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,863
The Norwegian police confiscated

1236
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:35,519
Which is all the proof about all the stories he tells about that

1237
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:46,271
In the CIA

1238
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
This is another essential

1239
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,111
A piece of this hero's journey that

1240
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
This tragedy

1241
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,719
That makes them unable to unequivocally

1242
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Calabasas

1243
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:00,607
If his wife hadn't been brainwashed into filing false charges against them he never would have had his computers

1244
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,399
He would still have all the proof

1245
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
Global

1246
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:10,079
But now he just has to be totally right about everything and everyone looks at him like he's a Madman

1247
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
Spoiler alert

1248
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:18,015
He is a Madman

1249
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,063
You have no idea without doing

1250
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,879
Leo's Message Board post continues

1251
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:29,535
Quote from the 5th of March 2008 I'm officially a Christian again as my sufferance has made me realize

1252
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:35,423
He is our only Savior and Muhammad is a false prophet is descendants are involved in Satanism in the New World Order

1253
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,031
Soleo left Islam and Christianity

1254
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,079
But guess what Jordan settings

1255
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Rejoin

1256
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,503
According to his also rejoined the Illuminati

1257
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,647
And that's just somebody higher up in the Illuminati

1258
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,719
No teak access to the sky

1259
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,167
I will say that it does work

1260
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
Chris wave when your make

1261
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
True

1262
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
That's true that is helpful

1263
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,823
Soleo claimed 2008

1264
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,455
Personally controls major parts of the Illuminati

1265
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
For good

1266
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
As you've already pointed out this

1267
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:29,439
He claimed he was protected by a 12000 manstrong paramilitary group called the green lion security

1268
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,023
Interesting Lee lion being his maternal last name

1269
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
There is no evidence

1270
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Is that this group exists

1271
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
Apparently rejoining the Illuminati

1272
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
Protect Leo from legal

1273
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Whole Foods

1274
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
12000

1275
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
According to his own book

1276
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,039
Confessions of an Illuminati volume

1277
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,135
He was arrested in July 2008 when he arrives at a courthouse work

1278
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Child custody

1279
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,487
Apparently recently appeared on an internet can

1280
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
Conspiracy show and quotes

1281
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,351
In a typical Italian actor bravado threatened

1282
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,167
To kill the Norwegian prime minister Jens stoltenberg

1283
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:17,567
Bloomfield threatened to bring down the buildings of government and Parliament in doorway

1284
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
But he says quote

1285
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
I'm serious about the death right

1286
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
It is the Italian way of expressing

1287
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,231
Strong emotion through strong words

1288
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
Alright alright okay alright

1289
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:46,239
I did I thought I was Italian up a time

1290
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,823
Excuse for George prime minister

1291
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,895
Leah was lucky to walk away without facing

1292
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Charges or jail time

1293
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:58,015
Time for that probably do much

1294
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
To help his already in Norman

1295
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
Complex

1296
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
And tendencies towards grandiosity

1297
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,975
He continued unabated pretending he was in charge of a large portion

1298
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Of the Illuminati

1299
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,583
Not want to let this craziness cool down to room temperature

1300
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,679
Leo zagami made another interesting religious conversion in 2009

1301
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
As he should

1302
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,007
No

1303
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,335
New religion for 2012 Matrix ism

1304
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:27,455
Yes Matrix ism is the official religion of mayordomo Illumina Touareg universalis

1305
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,783
Nothing else will be tolerated about true illuminated beings

1306
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,623
Cuz of light working for the science of God and the kingdom of God in 29

1307
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
I've only got one thing to say

1308
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
There's a pretty consistent thread through his work.

1309
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
The kingdom of God is going to

1310
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,351
We started at 2019

1311
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,887
Which makes it particularly

1312
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,519
As they celebrate 4th of July

1313
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:59,199
Matrix isn't was a religion created by Anonymous individuals online

1314
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,551
Leo would later go on to imply that he was involved in the creation of the religion

1315
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831
Which might be true

1316
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,159
Since the founders were Anonymous I can't really confirm or deny it

1317
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,255
What I can confirm is that creating a religion based on a movie

1318
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
Squarely in category of things

1319
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,911
I would believe Leo zagami could have done it makes me

1320
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:25,567
Very sad people who got really depressed after Avatar because they could never lie

1321
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,151
Live in Pandora

1322
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,175
You know

1323
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
You could just feel things

1324
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,295
When are we going to get judges

1325
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Is to understand who's

1326
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Who is it

1327
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,135
To the point where we can

1328
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Tube8

1329
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
James O'Keefe

1330
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Massively James

1331
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,791
Somebody who does

1332
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Steal something

1333
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
Goddamn 7-Eleven

1334
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Not dangerous

1335
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Leo zagami

1336
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,239
Ruining thousands upon thousands of Lies

1337
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
City of influence

1338
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
Yeah

1339
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
In there man

1340
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,271
And how he has eluded first of all

1341
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
Just outright

1342
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,343
Exposure

1343
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
His life

1344
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:18,047
In 2009 when he was announce that Matrix ism is the official religion of his world

1345
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,607
Leo was fully back on his b*******

1346
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,703
You got a big fraction of the Illuminati use now in Georgia

1347
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
Conspiracy world

1348
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,287
Previously promoted him profile

1349
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,847
What kind of forced to go along with his new

1350
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,687
Or risk having to admit the bathing pool by a narcissistic weirdo

1351
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
Just because he had Natalia next

1352
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
He has them trapped because they

1353
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,159
Illuminati Insider

1354
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
And his base

1355
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
Cons of their beliefs on

1356
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,535
So we'll continue to pedal is Illuminati.

1357
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,071
Giving speeches here and there

1358
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,095
But honestly

1359
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,655
His Trail runs a little bit cold for a while

1360
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,751
Between 2009 and 2011 I'm not really sure what he was up to

1361
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
But

1362
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
In December 2011 he was arrested

1363
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,151
I have literally no idea what he was arrested for

1364
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,223
But I have to assume it has something to do with being a dick in public

1365
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,015
When he was in a processing room

1366
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,831
He gave a cameraman a little interview

1367
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,903
The illustrates the mindset that he was in at the time

1368
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:20,255
And we are now going to listen

1369
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
In this first clip

1370
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Leo

1371
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
Talk about how he was arrested

1372
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,191
I meant talk about what's going to happen on December

1373
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
21st

1374
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
2012

1375
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
Because Leo zagami

1376
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,311
Was very until 2012

1377
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,223
Do my English literature understand bad that I was arrested last night

1378
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:57,119
Olivia

1379
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:20,159
Call Amber

1380
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:26,815
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

1381
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:33,215
Emperor of the war

1382
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:39,615
On December 21st 2012 Leo zagami will become the emperor of the new Holy Roman Empire which is

1383
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:47,295
We know that in 2019 he is opening a bottle of champagne with Alex

1384
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,135
We do know that

1385
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
What's the difference

1386
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
Certainly

1387
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,487
There's a little bit

1388
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:03,167
I think it's some people could say hey this could be a guy doing a silly Italian accent

1389
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Like on drugs

1390
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Ready

1391
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
He's frustrated

1392
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,431
Smoking a cigarette

1393
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,735
I will give him

1394
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
This possibility

1395
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
Should he

1396
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
ESO

1397
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Want to take this out

1398
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Entirely possible

1399
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
He is having a full-on

1400
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
Manic episode

1401
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
Completely delusional

1402
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,559
About that problem is illusions

1403
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,607
Fit in with his life's work

1404
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,167
It just seems like a more overt

1405
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:39,007
Location of the things that I want of those things

1406
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Literally Jesus

1407
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:04,863
Call the obelisk in St Peters

1408
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Terraria

1409
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
Empire

1410
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
Great opportunity of having a lawyer

1411
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,415
Look when you're the Messiah what are you got to do

1412
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,559
Bring up this over there

1413
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,863
Do you want a baby

1414
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,751
Make a clarification for our audience so bad like I didn't mean to write or

1415
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,799
Right now that would be difficult

1416
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
Alex

1417
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,895
Tube

1418
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,063
Which was surprising

1419
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,903
It would be surprising

1420
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,695
It would be

1421
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,047
Fbb Netanyahu is like

1422
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:42,655
I look shocked as you check this guy out though

1423
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,127
I don't want anymore

1424
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,175
What are we going to do what are you doing

1425
01:13:54,431 --> 01:14:00,575
The next clubfoot Smackdown for because if you thought that the Revelation that he is

1426
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
Is shocking

1427
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
This next clip

1428
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
Is

1429
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
So much more shot

1430
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:18,751
Doby's Mill

1431
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:37,951
Between Tower

1432
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,375
11

1433
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,311
That is what I would

1434
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:58,687
I would never have guessed that I am Jesus would be followed up with

1435
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
I'm working with Osama bin Laden

1436
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:16,095
That's tougher Alex George Bush off the hook

1437
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,983
Thanks for 911

1438
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:29,663
Yeah that's strange I want to point out is that I've listened to a ton of Leo zagami interview

1439
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,711
And the way you speaking

1440
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Is

1441
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Not

1442
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,319
Out of order out of the norm

1443
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,671
Things that I know I've noticed with you when do as the

1444
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
More manic time

1445
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,255
Your manner of speaking is a little bit

1446
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
Like there's more pressure behind the

1447
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
The speech there's more

1448
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
You speak quicker

1449
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,215
People whenever they're in those episodes

1450
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
Windows

1451
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
This is very

1452
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,079
Normal

1453
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,639
This is normal speech patterns

1454
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:05,503
Northern Italy

1455
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,855
I don't know I don't think this is necessarily indicative of

1456
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,415
Some sort of a break with reality as much as it is like

1457
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
I got arrested

1458
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,767
Idol 4 I shouldn't be arrested I am

1459
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,559
It's it's

1460
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
Exasperation more than

1461
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
Like a break

1462
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,983
That's it that this sounds almost like

1463
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Robert Evans

1464
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
He's from the kid stays in the

1465
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:34,943
Was just a little bit less is just a little bit more drunk when he was given those interviews he be like

1466
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
Yeah that does sound like you

1467
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Robert Evans

1468
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,807
You probably think you were G

1469
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,111
While you're producing Rosemary's Baby

1470
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
He did 9/11

1471
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
He's Jesus

1472
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
He's working with Osama bin Laden

1473
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,559
And the Jews accepted that he was

1474
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,631
And they're not the only one

1475
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Democracy

1476
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Begone

1477
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,919
And that Christianity will be outlawed

1478
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,575
Roman Empire

1479
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:55,839
So here's the 2011 will be the only religion that allowed

1480
01:17:56,095 --> 01:18:01,471
Plies very strongly the Christian

1481
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:06,847
Who's the guy who's lived

1482
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,431
In favor of a novelty religion he is a legend

1483
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,967
Created

1484
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:18,623
And not just that the best possible but really I'm Leo

1485
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,887
Sew-in Leo's

1486
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:36,287
Conception we allowed you to have democracy

1487
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:41,663
We are Aristocrats we're in charge

1488
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Staunchly against

1489
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,783
So he's conception Leo's

1490
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,551
Is that

1491
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,183
In 2012 he will Ascend to the role of emperor of the new Holy Roman Empire

1492
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
As Jesus

1493
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:59,327
I've somehow I guess 911 was part of that setting the stage for it

1494
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:05,983
You'll see in 2012 were past it now and I don't

1495
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,175
Julio we didn't

1496
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,223
Your logic your strategy

1497
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,039
Man when we're wrong we can admit it

1498
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,855
What extic

1499
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,903
So Abby

1500
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
That's going to happen in

1501
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,231
2012

1502
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
Between 2012 and 2019 thoroughly

1503
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
The. Of tribulation

1504
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:36,447
It'll result in 2019 Harley clear about what that resolution

1505
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Implies

1506
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
But there's one thing that is

1507
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
That is true

1508
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
And he does

1509
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Say

1510
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,871
And that is you don't follow him

1511
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,407
You will die

1512
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:51,295
2019

1513
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:04,095
Covid-19

1514
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:09,215
What time do

1515
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
Haha

1516
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Haha

1517
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Right right

1518
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,424
Part of the Catholic Church

1519
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,496
Yeah like it this is the padlock

1520
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:47,616
Down there that has a really complicated code that only the real Jesus could unlock

1521
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:54,016
So now we've got the Jews and the Vatican

1522
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
Well

1523
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
They're fine that

1524
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,696
The savior is working with Osama Bin Laden I guess

1525
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
Right right

1526
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,024
This is a test

1527
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,584
Pill to swallow

1528
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,984
This is what we call a big Swig Leo insist that

1529
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
If you betray him

1530
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:21,920
Life human

1531
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:29,600
I never made any money

1532
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:44,448
Don't betray me

1533
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
Threatening

1534
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:49,312
I remember a lot of the times

1535
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,080
In the Bible when G

1536
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,688
Flexon hell

1537
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:59,040
So it's a little bit inside

1538
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,320
The nature of God

1539
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,112
It turns out that God is an alien

1540
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:33,344
Kingdom of God thank you very much for the people of the world

1541
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:41,280
There's one last year where you just sums it up that he is working with the New World Order

1542
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,144
Remember 7

1543
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,520
What's the news

1544
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
So he's got

1545
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
Lions

1546
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
All of that

1547
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
Happened

1548
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,136
Before Alex ever started having Leo on as it supposed to guest in the Illuminati

1549
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,928
And as an Insider and Vatican

1550
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,536
All of the things that I told you about

1551
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Including

1552
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,120
An interview that is publicly available

1553
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:21,472
11

1554
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,288
You think that I would want to ask him but how

1555
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,640
This responsibility as recognized

1556
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,456
A new world order

1557
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,696
Once the New World Order which he himself was took power in December 2012

1558
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,768
Weirdly none of that ever comes up on info

1559
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
Despite Leo making

1560
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
Bunch of appearances as well as being

1561
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:53,984
A noted Gaston David night and Owen Shroyer shows as well

1562
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,288
I think

1563
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,896
Clearly shows that Leo zagami is Lassen expert in anything

1564
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:03,968
It's very useful

1565
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
For someone like Alex

1566
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,576
A person like Leo's used to love the force of escalation

1567
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,904
Any mainstream news Outlook until you about the corruption

1568
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,232
The Vatican and how there's a systemic problem within the Catholic Church

1569
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,792
Where abuses have been covered up and abusers protect

1570
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
And that should make you feel bad

1571
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,608
Call

1572
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,472
But Leo zagami by pretending to be an Insider

1573
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Could tell Alex

1574
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,056
The preacher actually abusing children because it serves

1575
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
The purposes of demon

1576
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
Which of the country to the Earth using black

1577
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Magic

1578
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,712
And you can see how these two situations in Plaistow

1579
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
Lately different solution

1580
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
That's the sort of role that Leo zagami can play

1581
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,392
Towards radicalization escalation of rhetoric

1582
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,672
Rat is very Danger

1583
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Yeah it's

1584
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,048
Essentially acting as a

1585
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,400
Vatican

1586
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
Because if you can

1587
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,728
Since enough people that the real issue is

1588
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
Cops

1589
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Since they look at this

1590
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
Perhaps unintentionally

1591
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
I made it hard to nail down exactly

1592
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600
You know what is

1593
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Conscious

1594
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
What is

1595
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,928
Right kind of a byproduct of

1596
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:21,792
Stupidity is probably making it more difficult

1597
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,888
The treat the actual problems Alex start talking about

1598
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
Child

1599
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,288
Serious issues

1600
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Jordan

1601
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,152
You might remember how I told you that Leo zagami you

1602
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
Used to go by the name Leo Young

1603
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,992
And until 2006 or so

1604
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
The funny story about that

1605
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:52,512
He's a good DJ music live.org still has a profile up for Leo Young

1606
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,888
T.i. I don't know

1607
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,960
According to his music biography

1608
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
DJing on it

1609
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,152
1987

1610
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
Where you was a fixture at a bar called Legends

1611
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,760
Which according to his bio is a quote

1612
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
Celeb hot

1613
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
By 19

1614
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,904
He claims he reached the national finals

1615
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Prestigious

1616
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
DMC

1617
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
Jacob

1618
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
This very well may be true

1619
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
I can't find a list

1620
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,096
That Year's finalists for the Italian

1621
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,168
Can say with certainty that he didn't win

1622
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,240
Experience that contest whoever encouraged him to

1623
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,032
To get more involved with the Raves

1624
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
Respect the neck

1625
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
Decade

1626
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,688
He claims he is quote recognized as the man responsible for organizing Italy's

1627
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,456
Firstrade

1628
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,504
In Rome in 1989

1629
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:50,624
Well I'm not positive that history Bears out that Leo zagami organized the first Raven

1630
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,672
In Italy he's not making up that he was

1631
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Involved

1632
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,768
I found a mention of him in an essay posted on the Red Bull Music

1633
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
Academy's website title quotes

1634
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,864

94

1637
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,984
Well there isn't much about him in the article this is what is

1638
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,312
Quote for all the excitement amongst these young DJ

1639

The vast majority of Roman club Owners and party promoters were less enthusiastic

1644
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,696
This is an article about the rapes

1645
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
Which centered more less around drugs

1646
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,072
At Leo zagami is described as quote and notorious

It seems like that was always kind of part of his personality

01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
Are you just ramble about nonce

Learn more about recording by becoming

1690
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,736
The famous London production duo Double Trouble

1691
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,552
If you was Illuminati royalty and all that

1692
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
It doesn't

1693
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,856
Like you'd make a specific

1694
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,672
Point of his grandmother pay for him

1695
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,696
Study with some London

1696
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
That seems kind of ink

1697
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:39,328
That's the first thing that every Illuminati child is

1698
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,936
Say it's our grandmother

1699
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,728
The next line is even weirder

1700
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,824
Talking about how when things were going well for him in London quote

1701
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,456
Unfortunately he had to go back to Italy where at the time you had to do an obligatory year of bollocks in the military

1702
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,992
Before getting your passport back

1703
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,064
If he was a member of the ruling Elite bloodline

1704
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
Prince Illuminati

1705
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:07,488
You'd think they'd be able to get him out of something that trivial interfered so drastically with his life

1706
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,024
See you as a bone spur for

1707
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
For fucksake

1708
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
Curious

1709
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,096
Distance from this long-winded

1710
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,400
And very clearly self-written bio

1711
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,448
2006

1712
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Degree Mason

1713
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
Secret societies at all

1714
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
Turn of the Illuminati

1715
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
None of that is under

1716
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,248
The only time the battle

1717
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,320
I can even comes up is when he says the quote

1718
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,392
We're happy with him hosting a rave in an old church

1719
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,464
If I'm being honest with you I don't know what to make

1720
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:43,072
My mind goes back and forth between thinking that his luck had run out with the clubs

1721
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
2006

1722
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,376
2007

1723
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:48,192
And it wasn't paying the bills anymore so we decided

1724
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Then I also

1725
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,776
It's possible the baby he did way too many drugs

1726
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,568
He started to believe his own bulshit

1727
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,896
With the information available there's no way

1728
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:03,808
All I can say is that Leo zagami is Loki one of the most interesting people who's ever been on an episode of Infowars

1729
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:08,928
Interesting

1730
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,048
And Leo zagami life

1731
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,448
You've totally wanted to hang out with him and listen to everything he had to say absolutely

1732
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,336
Let us all enjoy someone's Leo zagami music

1733
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:32,736
Leo Young's music this song is this a little sample is from a I cannot stop

1734
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:36,064
It's called DJ pimp and the Scarlet woman

1735
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:30,848
Add layers after every break

1736
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:35,712
It goes on like that for

1737
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,760
I don't know but it's okay is a while back

1738
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
Look

1739
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
Honestly

1740
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:48,768
Beethoven's music

1741
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
Pickles are Kerry Cassidy

1742
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,840
He has some skill

1743
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
First tracks

1744
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,080
Just a few months back

1745
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,128
New interplanetary Belvedere

1746
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,224
Italian record label artists spotlight

1747
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,808
Elio Young

1748
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
I've listened to the whole thing and it

1749
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Pretty service

1750
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
I'm not sure any of it reaches the level of being a hit

1751
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,512
But none of it is stuff that if you heard in the club

1752
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,304
Particularly like in the early 90s

1753
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,328
You be yelling for them tutor

1754
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Turn off

1755
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,912
Leo zagami is still an active DJ

1756
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,240
Are you talking about now

1757
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:36,640
Like video of

1758
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,456
Four months ago promoting the gig in Russia

1759
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,248
Greeley

1760
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,784
Really

1761
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Like what I was looking into

1762
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
His history

1763
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
All the stuff about like

1764
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,888
Wait a second

1765
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Claim that you

1766
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Secretly

1767
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,008
Infiltrated Islam

1768
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,056
I like this is a fascinating story

1769
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Am I cute

1770
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,384
Hours into this rabbit hole

1771
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:12,992
He claims he's a DJ there any music available

1772
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Oh he's not

1773
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,528
Make that up

1774
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,832
It was just the craziest roller coaster ride

1775
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
Had to go down

1776
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
Nana's

1777
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,160
He is a

1778
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:24,512
Interesting figure whenever he's talking about his real life

1779
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:30,912
What I'm talking about

1780
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:36,032
I'm not positive but I've ever talked about this tail light

1781
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,848
Alex

1782
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,128
Dalio on

1783
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
Infowars in present day

1784
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
Communist

1785
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,552
Scam

1786
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
That's kind of

1787
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
The place he serves

1788
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,720
I mean that we are in a situation with

1789
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
Trash communist can

1790
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,472
This is

1791
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:09,568
IDK used to say a song Back in the Days by

1792
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,320
Text Beverly Hills Cop

1793
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:25,696
Also I am

1794
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
Anymore but

1795
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,792
The show

1796
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,608
And also

1797
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
Alex

1798
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,168
It's clearly defensive

1799
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,448
About criticism

1800
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,496
Robert Barnes is on the show

1801
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,896
All the f****** time are there

1802
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:51,296
It is yet another inch

1803
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:57,696
Responding to criticism

1804
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,720
Cuz he's a little

1805
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,240
Council

1806
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,432
His body

1807
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,760
Just doesn't know who his friends are

1808
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
I've gotten that you got in with the wrong

1809
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
Krowd

1810
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
Now we got bars

1811
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Barnes

1812
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:33,024
He wants to become an American

1813
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:50,432
Who is Miss America

1814
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:55,808
What about

1815
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:02,208
Bolsonaro like you keep talking about

1816
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:07,584
The globalist globalist Allies around the world what the f*** are you talking

1817
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Where the f*** does

1818
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,776
Is this fit into your Holy Roman Empire

1819
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:22,176
What you want to become an American cuz Trump is president when you clearly have designs of world domination

1820
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,736
If you realize the Trump doesn't

1821
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
Stay present

1822
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Forever

1823
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,320
Like there's going to be a different press

1824
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
I think they think

1825
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,624
Yeah I think they do

1826
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,696
Also

1827
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,632
I don't think that naturalization

1828
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,680
Would be like well you know we

1829
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:50,080
Get why you did it it was 11 years but we got it

1830
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
I think you'd have more difficult

1831
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,992
Text clip

1832
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,552
I was just gets back to his trumpet

1833
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Exorcism

1834
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
And

1835
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:03,904
Loves it

1836
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:07,232
We have become exceptionally in some respects

1837
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,536
I guess what great power comes

1838
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,072
Responsibility

1839
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Over the soul of America

1840
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:41,792
Watch

1841
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,032
Where to

1842
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:52,800
You catch that

1843
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,592
Yeah

1844
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
Bordelon from

1845
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,992
Responsibility

1846
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:07,648
I think Alex realized in the middle of the quote that it was Spider-Man

1847
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
Power Acworth

1848
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,072
I wonder how he felt about far for

1849
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
From home I imagine he saw that recently

1850
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
I bet he was.

1851
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:30,432
Did you know that so he was a British politician he was super into the Confederacy during the American Civil War

1852
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:32,480
But don't worry

1853
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,272
Slavery.

1854
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,552
Union quotes

1855
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
The slave-owner as an enemy

1856
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,160
Slave as an instrument for his destruction

1857
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,560
Also

1858
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:51,168
He literally said quote political rights proceed directly for religious duties

1859
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,472
And I hold this to be the basis for liberalism

1860
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,568
Leo Leo zagami

1861
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
Probably

1862
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,128
What I'm getting at is Lord Acton's.

1863
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:03,712
Because

1864
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,784
Look stupid in front of

1865
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,320
Which on its own is in

1866
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
Incredibly

1867
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
Yeah that is

1868
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,280
Jesus and your 911

1869
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:24,448
Giving a Spider-Man quotes

1870
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
Smartest man

1871
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
Yeah

1872
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,056
So do you ask

1873
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
The Christian exorcism ritual thing

1874
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,808
No.

1875
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
Absolutely I mean

1876
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,000
Thinking the same thing

1877
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,792
Fultz form

1878
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,864
Be powerful

1879
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,472
Absolutely

1880
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,592
This is Philly

1881
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
This is

1882
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,408
Sweetly f****** silly

1883
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,944
Quite frankly

1884
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:11,552
They're talking about Trump conducting a

1885
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Yes

1886
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,880
Liking this is what they're about now

1887
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:22,048
This is a guy who claims that he has all the white version

1888
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:27,936
Magic Ritual

1889
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,984
It's not like you

1890
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,312
No

1891
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,640
Shout out to Robert Evans

1892
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Love's egregore

1893
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,272
Vented by the French poet Victor

1894
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,320
Hugo and his book The Legend

1895
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:48,160
It's a faulty transliteration of the Greek word egregore

1896
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,208
Which Loosely translates to water

1897
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
It's close to a Greek word though.

1898
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,072
Mistaken it was a fake word created by Vic

1899
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,376
Central Recreation

1900
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,680
Weirdos

1901
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,960
Including collectibles

1902
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,496
BMV

1903
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:04,544
Society

1904
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,592
It's been adopted into all their mythology

1905
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,944
It's the same thing with Lovecraft created the fictional book the Necronomicon

1906
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:16,064
Well then a bunch of ton of real world

1907
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:21,696
The number of definitions out there for what counts as an egregore

1908
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
But the general rule is

1909
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,816
The thought-form this brought by the thoughts of a group

1910
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
People

1911
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,912
So for instance if you want to take a note of benign and very basic level

1912
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,704
Klaus is an egregore

1913
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:38,336
For the most part the new age in a cult world's take on it is basically just dress up versions of Base

1914
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,616
Self-help ideas

1915
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,896
Basically just artistic

1916
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,456
Expressions used to warn people not to let negative thoughts

1917
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
Consume them

1918
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:48,576
Leslie manifestos negative thoughts

1919
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,856
Like the god of guilt at

1920
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:52,928
Sure

1921
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
You have like

1922
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:58,560
Popo's that are created individually and then egregores are created as a

1923
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,608
Different kinds of clocks

1924
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,912
Edward Elementals

1925
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
So don't do it

1926
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:12,896
What you might call the mainline version of new Ag and occult nonsense

1927
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,688
But that's not how everyone

1928
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,968
1st and egregore

1929
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:23,136
I found an interesting post about egregores friendly explicitly

1930
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,160
Red Ice Radio

1931
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,232
Where the author discusses how a listener named George

1932
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,048
I told him about a conversation I had with a quote

1933
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,584
Heiress of a ridged

1934
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,352
Jewish

1935
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:37,472
King Family who was a Rothschild family

1936
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
Like how close today

1937
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:47,968
Leah was one

1938
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:48,736
To my classmate

1939
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
Accept the Geneva University

1940
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,112
She was an attractive blue-eyed blond lady

1941
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
And she was wearing the Star of David I asked if she was a believer

1942
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:02,304
She answered yes or no and then added she believed

1943
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,864
A god of the Jews who was

1944
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,912
The Jews rather than survival

1945
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:10,240
I immediately asked whether she was speaking of an egregore

1946
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,288
The response was yes

1947
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,824
And she broke that conversation

1948
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
Never again did we mention

1949
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,432
The subject

1950
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,504
The article goes on to suggest

1951
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,064
Jews of the past

1952
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,368
Create

1953
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,416
Which explains their world domination

1954
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:31,744
The article says quote is this egregore is Lucifer

1955
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,048
And Elite Jews have made him

1956
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,840
The master meme of the New World Order

1957
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,168
The elite Jews are the Communist capitalist internet

1958
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
My friend you change a couple of words and that's that

1959
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,056
You got yourself and Alex Jones quote

1960
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,176
Got a genie

1961
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,456
To do their bit

1962
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:56,576
Jin's come out of a different cultures

1963
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,720
You know I was doing the Americanized

1964
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:07,584
Like whatever you have to

1965
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
You can't

1966
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,632
He can't deviate off the path

1967
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,168
Passed because

1968
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:20,128
To say I strongly disagree with everything in that article but I do admit that it is swinging

1969
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:20,896
Sing for the fence

1970
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,480
Listen to this amazing rationalization for being a bigot

1971
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:30,112
It doesn't take a genius to recognize this egregore is the cause of anti-semitism

1972
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:37,536
L using them to manipulate Jews who were taught that they are reviled for no reason

1973
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
You see Jordan

1974
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,120
Don't hate Jews for no reason

1975
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,144
It's just

1976
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,424
Stink truly consent

1977
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,984
The egregore which is what they're really again

1978
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,056
Progressive rationalization

1979
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
Wow

1980
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,896
It does not take a genius

1981
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:53,920
In fact

1982
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,224
It explicitly excludes

1983
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,760
Believing

1984
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
So you know what's weird about this blog post

1985
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,136
Other than the content

1986
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,952
I found it identical post out now

1987
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
Auntie

1988
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:12,608
A closer look revealed that this article wasn't actually written by someone who works for red eyes

1989
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,216
It was a reposting of an article that was originally posted on the website of a guy named

1990
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:17,984
Henry Mack

1991
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
With a byline on it

1992
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,128
Literature

1993
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:29,504
So it's definitely good Prudential for him to win publishing

1994
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,112
Glimpsing around mackhouse a pretty good sense of what he's all about

1995
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,720
His most recent post was quote Jews immigration to divide and conquer

1996
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,816
A quick look through his archives shows the following headlines from

1997
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,144
Identify with whites

1998
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,984
Event proved Protocols of Zion

1999
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,312
Prime

2000
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
You might be a redneck

2001
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:06,368
Shut out of Twitter for a week I wonder why

2002
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:09,696
Rimac outruns eclipse

2003
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:16,096
Asymmetric website where he wrote an article in 2007

2004
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,168
Otoscopy created to destroy non-jews

2005
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,496
Which was then widely circulated on very high-profile aunt

2006
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
Systematic websites and media Outlets like red eyes

2007
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
David Dukes

2008
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,872
Where do I bring all this

2009
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,992
It can't just be good because I love saying egregore even though I do

2010
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
Yeah

2011
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,832
In 2008 when Leo zagami wife left

2012
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,024
We are reached out to carry to prove it he knew about that allege Norwegian politician who would contacted warning about

2013
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,048
Our planet

2014
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
He was clearly looking

2015
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
A rebooking on the show

2016
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,728
This Norwegian politician

2017
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,312
Consent to friends

2018
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:00,384
Where do the politician

2019
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,176
One of those two people

2020
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Was Henry Makow

2021
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,784
I'll reach you now from his letter from March

2022
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
13th

2023
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,576
2008

2024
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,904
Which I remind you is after Maca wrote his article

2025
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,256
Accusing the Jewish religion of being based on a communist Lucifer

2026
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,304
Leo begins with letter quote

2027
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,096
Dear Henry thank you for your kids

2028
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
Continuous support

2029
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,912
Forgive me if I could not reply earlier

2030
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,776
The weather is mostly about I was wife was secretly working for the Illuminati and that's why she left him

2031
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,848
And then awkwardly shoehorned into it or a couple references

2032
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,384
Is this Norwegian politician

2033
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
The content of the message

2034
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,944
Important

2035
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,736
Clear friendly tone of it

2036
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,040
He refers to Henry is my friend

2037
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,576
Dear Henry multiple times

2038
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136
Eddie and the letter fraternally yours

2039
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,512
Leo zagami is listed as a source or reference in no less than 15 article

2040
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
On Henry's website

2041
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,072
Dating back to 2000

2042
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,888
I have a long-standing relationship

2043
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,424
And let me put it simply

2044
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,240
Egregore is not a commonly used word

2045
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:00,288
And Henry seems to use it 81

2046
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,848
Here are the headlines

2047
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,432
Is it come up when you search Henry Mack has website for the word egregore

2048
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:10,016
Purim celebrate the slaughter of their opponents

2049
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,648
Jews the unloved

2050
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,416
People

2051
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,696
And then here's another one

2052
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,232
Leo zagami

2053
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:22,304
December 12th 2012 start seven years of tribulation

2054
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,912
Points of a Skype conversation that Henry had with Leo

2055
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,192
It includes this pasta

2056
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,752
Quote Leo mentioned

2057
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
Cabalist

2058
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,848
Then it says in parentheses

2059
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
Macau

2060
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,432
The guy that Victor is that

2061
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,968
With a hyperlink

2062
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,552
About how they created

2063
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,600
All this

2064
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Is enough to be

2065
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,904
Really f******

2066
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,976
Sad little license

2067
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:57,376
I should tell you the Project Camelot was not the first high-profile interview that Leo zagami did in his antiloop

2068
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,400
Luminati career

2069
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,448
In December 2006

2070
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,728
He appeared as a guest

2071
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,008
Best on Red Ice Radio

2072
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:09,664
The white supremacist

2073
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
Defies antisem

2074
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,736
This Jordan

2075
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,272
Is what you called way too many

2076
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,040
Red flags

2077
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:21,440
Oh and about Leo's wife leaving him that I mentioned earlier and told you to remember the one that was written by

2078
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,464
A personal friend of his

2079
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,536
That one was called Kent reversing papers

2080
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,328
The blog was written by a guy named

2081
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
Kent Daniel bentkowski

2082
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,424
Cat passed away in August 2000

2083
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,984
Edit block is way too difficult to navigate

2084
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,312
So I don't really know too much about what he's all about

2085
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,848
But if you search for his name

2086
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,896
The first thing that comes up in a Google search

2087
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,176
Is it eulogy Poe

2088
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
Before him

2089
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,760
On the website of you guessed it

2090
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
Red Ice Radio

2091
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,344
Gaston their show at least

2092
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,112
10 *

2093
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,392
Which tells me

2094
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:56,000
All you need to know about what he stops for anybody

2095
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:58,304
Comes up

2096
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,864
You're a really unfair Shake

2097
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,168
Demonizing

2098
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,192
Here's a little clip

2099
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,008
They want you

2100
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:09,056
Straight white guy

2101
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,592
Suffering and death

2102
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,360
Dead

2103
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,896
They want your daughters

2104
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,968
Brainwash to disown you and your son's groveling at

2105
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
You know

2106
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,344
You know who they is

2107
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:26,976
She doesn't explain.

2108
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,048
To be like at you know who we're talking about

2109
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:33,632
Yeah you do

2110
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:39,264
So I think Leo even on top of all the interesting aspect

2111
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
Step is life

2112
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:43,616
Clearly involved with a lot of people who have

2113
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
Deeply

2114
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
Anti-Semitic

2115
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:52,064
Worldview perpetuates a dear friend of Henry Makow Israel

2116
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,344
From way back

2117
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,928
I don't I don't think there's any conclusion UK

2118
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,208
Can draw other than

2119
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,744
Some of that stuff

2120
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,024
Is

2121
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,048
Probably

2122
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,888
In his is Raichu

2123
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
On

2124
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
Alex's show

2125
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,728
Clearly

2126
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,008
Exist in the

2127
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,544
Context of

2128
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,872
Gore accusation

2129
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,664
Of the Jewish god

2130
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,736
Being creation out of the Mind

2131
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,016
Of

2132
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:22,784
Sweet dreams of the

2133
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
The past in order to

2134
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088
Navigate the world

2135
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,624
You know it makes

2136
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,392
So much so

2137
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:31,232
Ini dad be fine with it if they weren't

2138
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
F******

2139
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
Directly

2140
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:34,816
Contribute

2141
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,584
And

2142
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,424
Of course these people get

2143
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,264
Conned non-stop you have to be really really stupid

2144
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,544
To believe any of this

2145
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:54,784
Nigerian scams

2146
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,600
The promise

2147
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,904
Akhand and then making more people

2148
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928
F******

2149
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,488
Right

2150
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,280
What

2151
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,816
The same way burning coal

2152
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,608
Releases

2153
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,888
Better destruct

2154
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,448
Burning

2155
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
This sort of coal

2156
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,264
This sort of

2157
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,056
Con

2158
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
The by-product it pollutes

2159
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,128
Is that other

2160
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
People become

2161
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,200
Much more stupidly

2162
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:23,968
Yeah

2163
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:28,064
Yeah it that is probably a big part of what makes it so abject

2164
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:32,416
I mean

2165
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:37,792
As long as I wasn't

2166
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:41,376
That's why V like a the confidence-man

2167
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,656
Is such an archetype

2168
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,448
In American history

2169
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:50,336
Kind of enjoyable about watching someone pull off like a really good spam

2170
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:55,712
Especially when it's against the rich person or somebody like that

2171
01:53:55,968 --> 01:54:02,112
They totally have a coming I don't want them to have their fun is a hero for a reason

2172
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,904
There's nothing

2173
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,440
Intrinsically wrong with

2174
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
When you're directing it in the right place

2175
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,328
The part that's the problem

2176
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,192
So NSX clip

2177
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,496
This is Barney

2178
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,056
Stupid s***

2179
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,336
What a shock

2180
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,944
So there was all this effort to sort of

2181
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,248
American history

2182
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:32,320
American Freedom American Liberty

2183
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,464
Celebrating our military

2184
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,024
Celebrating the spirit

2185
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,096
Heroes and Patriots

2186
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:48,448
Overtime

2187
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:54,592
And not only here in America but around the world because it's America that led the world every other Democratic country

2188
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,992
American Revolution

2189
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:07,392
F****** stupid you're not even close to

2190
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:13,792
Realized it like really loudly in between every dead so Alex

2191
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:18,400
I think that he's listened to enough about ya listen to bunch

2192
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,704
Of his appearance

2193
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,240
Never

2194
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:25,056
And it's either a function of

2195
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,080
Subservience

2196
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,360
Like Alex knows

2197
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,384
That Barn

2198
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,176
He's got something

2199
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:36,064
So Alex doesn't have a spot to

2200
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,856
Zombie way router

2201
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,720
Barnes wasn't my butt

2202
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,768
And second

2203
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:47,584
Nice bed

2204
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
How

2205
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,376
Much

2206
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,144
Like Barn

2207
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,936
But if my lawyer

2208
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,240
With sitting in between two people

2209
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,776
That Trump just

2210
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,312
Exercise

2211
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
Literally

2212
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,640
Using Magic

2213
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,688
And I didn't say anything

2214
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,760
I'm a bad lawyer yeah and if you join in on

2215
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:10,368
Yeah exactly

2216
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,904
Concelebrating military prowess

2217
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Cuz he was like

2218
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,696
I'm not going to out

2219
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,232
Sign off

2220
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:22,400
But that's also because I think he doesn't want to be a lawyer any

2221
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:25,216
I think that there's probably

2222
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,496
Express

2223
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,800
He wants to be the go-to lawyer for

2224
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:33,152
Dumb s*** head settling lawsuit

2225
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:35,968
It also probably rather transition into this

2226
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:42,368
Paw Patrol

2227
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:46,208
Work for a living

2228
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:49,280
He can rattle off

2229
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,352
Stop

2230
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
The rest of it

2231
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,216
He's serviceable and propaganda role he could he can hang

2232
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:03,872
With the Owen Shroyer's and David nights of the world easily

2233
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:13,856
Leo zagami talks about how

2234
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,896
Priority are your problem

2235
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,456
You're going to Walmart in a mad about what

2236
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,480

What are you doing

2238
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,552
What is the point

2239
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:49,952
What do you have princess on the cover

2240
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,000
Wwjd

2241
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,560
What would Jesus

2242
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
Just be doing

2243
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,352
At Walmart

2244
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:58,656
Obvious

2245
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,960
Next clip

2246
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Good this is bad

2247
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,872
Is targeted for the same reason that

2248
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:14,272
All these American activities

2249
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,808
People Like Us.

2250
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,232
Infowars

2251
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,768
Infowars

2252
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,864
Infowars is independence day is July 4th

2253
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,888
Because it reflects

2254
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:36,288
Americana

2255
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,568
So

2256
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
You know

2257
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:42,176
Julian Castro Alexandria ocasio-cortez

2258
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,456
Milan Omar

2259
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,040
Don't love this country and actually working against

2260
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:49,856
Alex Jones

2261
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:52,416
Kaitlin Bennett America

2262
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,696
Really about

2263
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,464
Another one

2264
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,744
Protecting the real America

2265
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,424
Both groups are that are different from

2266
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,472
I didn't bet

2267
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:10,336
You know if there were something really easily distinguishable to tell between the two groups

2268
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,224
So

2269
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,016
Let me get let me ask you a question

2270
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,064
Infowars

2271
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:22,368
America

2272
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:24,160
They are the 4th of July

2273
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:33,632
Is authoritarian propaganda 101

2274
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:40,032
With the entire the only right version

2275
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:42,080
Patriotism

2276
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,128
Good job

2277
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:44,896
It does seem

2278
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,920
Like you should be

2279
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,688
Disqualified

2280
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,712
Calling your cell phone

2281
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:49,760
Noah Mara

2282
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,808
Cradle

2283
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,576
Plumbing

2284
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,368
It is a problem

2285
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:59,488
It's definitely we are the Fourth of July we are America

2286
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,280
You don't know what those

2287
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,840
You're making them up

2288
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,168
Just taking

2289
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:10,240
Xenophobia racism

2290
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:13,056
Hierarchical structures that are create a red suit

2291
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,336
Superficial characteristics

2292
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,760
Something's it there's been a trend

2293
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,040
Away from

2294
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:29,184
It doesn't seem like it fits within our ID

2295
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
Deals

2296
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:31,232
At least the idea

2297
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,512
Set forth

2298
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,280
Brilliant

2299
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,608
1812 9th

2300
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,376
1844

2301
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,656
When they wrote

2302
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,680
The Declaration

2303
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,984
You know Leo zagami

2304
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,592
Does he think

2305
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,640
He is a reincarnate

2306
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
Four of the bloodline

2307
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:55,040
If it's not it's not clear but he literally said he is

2308
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:58,368
Videos of Messiah news also from the bloodline

2309
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,136
Right

2310
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:02,208
So

2311
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,488
Like I said I think he's

2312
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:06,816
Typically breathing in order to make it to Alex candid erupted

2313
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,096
Which is a smart move on his

2314
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:11,424
Much more time

2315
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,704
A button this

2316
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,240
I think he shows

2317
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,008
Is card

2318
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
In terms of like

2319
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,824
Really wanting to

2320
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,104
Just a comment on the show

2321
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,896
Listen

2322
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,664
Is Prozac

2323
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
Farts does it home

2324
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:30,112
President Trump's America forever

2325
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:36,512
Forever

2326
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:44,704
Because the audience continue to support it because the audience

2327
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:58,784
Next level

2328
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:03,904
My eyes

2329
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,976
Start singing battle

2330
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:13,632
The reverse of what it called does when they open up Galaxy

2331
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,656
Taking your products

2332
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:21,056
That was

2333
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,336
Smoothies

2334
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,360
Consignment Barnes

2335
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,152
Unapologetically

2336
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,944
Knocking it out of the park

2337
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,784
I mean he's had a day

2338
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,576
Here he's drinking champagne

2339
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,856
He's hung out with

2340
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,648
Jesus who did 9/11

2341
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:42,304
Also Club DJ

2342
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,704
A lot of people

2343
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:53,312
If I were him I'd need a drink

2344
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:56,384
So here's how he ends up finishing up the

2345
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:00,480
The Sun

2346
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,000
We're going to fight to ensure that

2347
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,024
Alright

2348
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,864
24-hours on-air whatever

2349
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,496
What's the difference

2350
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,312
Between this episode another present day episode

2351
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,848
I think

2352
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,384
Well first of all

2353
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,808
That story and I've been like this episode was a

2354
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,368
The thing is like

2355
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,928
I think in the present day

2356
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,976
I recognize the stakes

2357
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,000
So the things he's saying

2358
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:47,584
And they become so serious that I allow Alex

2359
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,352
To really

2360
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,120
Guide

2361
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,400
What I need to cover

2362
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:53,216
Where is I approached this episode centipede

2363
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:56,800
Trump is doing an exorcism in his fourth of July

2364
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:02,432
Is so goddamn stupid myself to be like what's interesting to me here

2365
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:08,064
How much do I know about Leo zagami and it led me down these roads that are far left

2366
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,856
I mean they're disturbing

2367
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,648
They're less

2368
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,672
Awful

2369
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,488
I think I think I need to take care of that with me

2370
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,792
In the future I think it's a lesson learned

2371
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
Of you know

2372
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,632
Don't shy away from the important stuff

2373
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,656
When Alex

2374
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,680
Is being a dick about it

2375
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,216
But also trucks

2376
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:29,568
Better story to be told somewhere else right where Alex is

2377
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,688
Another episode on

2378
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:38,272
Complete Nutter bigot

2379
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,832
Start another civil war

2380
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,232
Also I think they're still

2381
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:49,536
I think there is some value to

2382
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:51,072
Keeping an eye on

2383
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,352
Presidents

2384
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,936
I think it's far more important to

2385
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,960
Trust my

2386
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,240
To nowhere

2387
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,008
Interesting

2388
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,056
Could be

2389
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:03,872
Not least because you did not begin this episode with

2390
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,408
With your usual exhortation

2391
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:10,784
Parts of it that I hate

2392
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,576
But man

2393
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:15,136
Live account

2394
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
Crazy

2395
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
Hades.

2396
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,464
What a life

2397
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,584
You know if he wasn't mixed up with

2398
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:28,448
People trying to rationalize antisemitism didn't have the complete

2399
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,496
Real dicey

2400
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,800
Dubious history

2401
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,848
Personal life

2402
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,920
I want to talk to that guy

2403
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:40,992
At the right point

2404
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:41,760
Anna's life

2405
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,808
Definitely

2406
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:51,744
He already was quote a notoriously Wild

2407
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,512
Yeah baby

2408
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:59,424
On Wednesday with another episode but until then we have website

2409
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:06,080
The threats were also on Twitter also

2410
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:12,480
Contact you if they want more details is all this month

2411
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,016
For the next year

2412
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:19,136
Yeah yeah the month of July formation

2413
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,928
Showtime

2414
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,680
Nearest

2415
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:32,704
Mariano's

2416
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,472
They often

2417
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:39,360
Speakers

2418
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:44,736
I know it's a lot more people are going to the bar at Mariano's now

2419
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:49,600
Other than that

2420
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
What's a

2421
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,816
I forgot about that part of it

2422
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,192
Uncle Ben

2423
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:10,336
That's not good

2424
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:14,688
Uncle from Spider-Man

2425
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:15,712
Is Alex Jones

2426
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:24,416
Alex
