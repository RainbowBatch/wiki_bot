00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

Dan Jordan

00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Quick question

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Ensure

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
Have you ever been submerged in a body of water fully clothed

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
On purpose or by being pushed of war the

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,040
Probably I know that it like really stick out to me in terms of like if I was pushed

12
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
2 something right I mean like it would be

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
Some bullying in

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Center something had a party in all of you all of your and your friends jumped into the river

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
That is an uncommon thing about life

16
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
Specific things but like swimming in clothes

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Missouri

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
The reason I'm having a tough time with your question

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Is because it's like he has this weird

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Oh yeah it's places that we had that we would go

21
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Has booze smokes weed

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Jump in the water

23
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
But

24
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Guess one

25
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
So

26
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
Time is like a little

27
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Creek

28
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
View in a lake

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
It's not like

30
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
It was not alike

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Charmed

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,432
Too far away from my house and become winter we would go out

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,528
Play on the ice such as I did

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Fallen

35
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,184
Through the ice nightmare

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Not a gigantic

37
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Pond

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Really deep

39
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
It wasn't a situation like

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
And I can't find the hole

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,872
I don't know where to go

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Felon into freezing water I'm going to get hypothermia

43
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
I was able to get out of the water

44
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
But it was terrifying

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,512
What time the really sticks out of being in water in my clothes

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
You just like well I'm going to lose my my toes now

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
Yeah I don't think it's weird being bodies of water

48
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
Zagg liberal City Elite

49
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
The out-of-doors

50
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,528
Scared of the dark, but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

51
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
Sing episode to go over we are sticking in the

52
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
7th 2020

53
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,864
Friday's episode and then we're also going over

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
A special episode that Alex put out

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
On Saturday

56
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Very uncommon

57
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
Okay for him but I usually only has shows Monday through Friday right

58
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
This week you decided

59
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
VR hands

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,272
Got to do a Saturday episode

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
You bet

62
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,696
So there'll be a bit of Coronavirus

63
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
I believe that this is

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
It's still worth talking about

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Because there is an evolution

66
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
I think

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Viruses evolve

68
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,983
A mutation or what's his coverage of the Wuhan Coronavirus

69
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Situation

70
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Is

71
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Changing

72
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Coronavirus

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
And it takes a very

74
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
Severe step on Friday's episode Orlando

75
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Towns in this version of

76
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,671

77
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Start the recovery in Orlando

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023

Thank you so much you are now

97
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Mike like Bray Wyatt

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
So Jordans

99
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Like I said

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
February 7th 2020

101
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Here's an out-of-context

102
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
Very few people Tabata pull of us her baby

103
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Fair enough

104
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
Hey I'm going to need some hard numbers on that

105
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,879
He does not every starting I will learn

106
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Real thing that he sucks

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Early's most reasonable to assume

108
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Harris J

109
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,983
So we started on the 7th and Alex has an announcement and I got pretty

110
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Excited about this

111
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
Ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday

112
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Transmission

113
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
And we have a very special

114
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Yes

115
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
Joining us but I'm going to rebroadcast for a little while

116
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
I got to work on

117
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
And then I'm going to come back with all this breaking news information today

118
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,983
Crater the bioweapons access biological warfare weapon

119
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
In depth

120
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Intel that's breaking the no one else has you know this

121
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Type of person

122
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
That's a lot of big contacts

123
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
The United Nations and worldwide

124
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
He was also slow them Elijah B lawyer

125
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
What

126
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Connected to

127
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
No no no

128
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
Who is Slobodan milosevic his lawyer

129
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
Airport Point hear that Alex really should clarify is Vic Francis Boyle was not Slobodan milosevic

130
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
That would be a f****** weird credential for a bio weapons expert

131
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
The Hague for violating the Geneva

132
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Budget

133
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Rodger stone with his lawyer

134
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
It sure would be strange for Alex be bragging about one of his guests for Naturals by saying you defended the first sitting

135
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
World leader

136
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
To ever be charged with war crimes

137
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
Oil was that not milosevic doesn't care about the

138
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,639
In reality boil he did file charges to the international court of justice

139
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
That's accusing Serbia under milosevic

140
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Of committing genocide again

141
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Against the Bosnian Muslim

142
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Some population

143
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Well it's not up for discussion whether or not a genocide took place in the Bosnian War they did not been decided in a court IFS

144
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,535
Serbia and Below Savage head directly or indirectly been responsible for those crimes

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,167
That trial resulted in the determination that Serbia was not directly or indirectly involved

146
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
In the genocide

147
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
But that they were responsible for not doing

148
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,103
Responsible in the sense that they didn't do what they needed to have done

149
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
To prevent

150
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Whatever you're feeling about that result of the trial

151
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Francis Boyle was not a lawyer make

152
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
He was just a person who drafted

153
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
It led to the open

154
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Meaning of that case

155
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Alex saying that Francis Boyle was Slobodan milosevic his lawyer is a deeply troubling slip-up

156
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Knowledge base

157
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
Not only does Alex not realize that boil

158
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Was involved in trying to get milosevic

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Charged with genocide

160
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,567
He doesn't seem to know that saying someone was milosevic his lawyer would not be a great thing

161
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,967
For them to have on the resume everyone deserves a fair defense stand that's in the Constitution

162
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
Unpacking milosevic

163
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
He does not get affairs

164
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,695
Alex wasn't aware that Slobodan milosevic she's one of the modern era is big villain

165
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
And that seems to me to be a little worse

166
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
So Francis Boyle has been a lawyer representing a few groups

167
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,471
However

168
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Alex could have brought those thing

169
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Like for instance

170
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Visor for the

171
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
For years

172
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Metallica

173
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Possibly bring up

174
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,295
Probably wouldn't want to do that since it involves people who don't think America is so great and don't want to be part of it

175
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
I don't think he wants me to have

176
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
It doesn't seem like he wants more Hawaii

177
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Or Alex

178
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
To bring up the fact that boil is Bennett advisor

179
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
Therefore the Palestinian Authority

180
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
But you probably wouldn't want to do that

181
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Palestinian

182
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
And then just being fully Clear Eyes for Palestinian rights

183
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
But I don't think I necessarily agree with boils position

184
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Which seems to be in favor of the

185
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
The destruction of Israel and he is also called it juist and

186
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Off of what I agree with

187
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
See that's what that's where you get to that full-circle situation where it's like somebody so anti-semitic their accidentally doing something

188
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
B helpful

189
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
I'm not entirely sure exactly what his

190
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,631
There are a lot of people who have some questions so I'll say that if you look into it

191
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Well Melissa B couldn't even afford him

192
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
So he knows

193
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
In January 2018 Fox 55 out of Champaign Illinois for the 10th

194
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
St Patrick's Day Celebrations cancelled

195
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Because of

196
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Concerned the kids are going to get drunk

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
He wanted bars and liquor stores to be banned from offering drink

198
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Specials or advertise

199
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
For the event

200
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487
Which seems like Alex whatever chilling effect on Free Speech

201
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,095
Yeah he also outlawed dancing in champagne glass

202
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
People getting drunk something back

203
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
As recently as a month ago boy was making a

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Appearances on podcast

205
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Trump needs to be in

206
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,407
Primarily for his complicity with Saudi Arabia and their atrocities Indiana

207
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
Probably didn't want to bring that up but

208
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
To be fair also boil is called for every president since at least Clinton to be a

209
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,879
So that I don't think is that wrong

210
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
This that's one of the ones where I get in

211
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
Boil is a bit of a complicated figure from a political

212
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Perspective

213
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,239
He definitely has some real entries in his resume mostly ending about 15 years ago

214
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
You have some positions that I think I can get down with like a y in Independence

215
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,407
But he also seems to really disproportionately hate Israel

216
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,295
Expresses his opposition there are more than political in nature

217
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Think I can get on board

218
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,927
I want Hawaiian Independence so the Jews can't get it God damn it no

219
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Whatever the case

220
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
About his

221
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Agreement

222
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Things like Hawaiian independent Palestinian rights

223
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
I do not know what you was up to and I would just as soon not

224
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,847
Consider him an ally

225
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
Too confusing and whatever the case

226
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
He was not melosa

227
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
Alex has no idea what he's talking

228
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Pretty much ever

229
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,671
I'm glad that Alex is back on the show now and he has Francis Boyle

230
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
She has

231
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
As opposed to the last time he was on

232
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
Cuz I went interview

233
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
So we will get to hear

234
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
What Francis Boyle brings to the table in terms of you bio-weapon on do not excite

235
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
No you shouldn't be

236
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
It's very disappointing

237
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
So

238
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Alex

239
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Has a new Theory

240
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
About the

241
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Wuhan

242
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Novel Coronavirus

243
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Right

244
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
It's not good

245
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
I'll give you that I'll give you that up front

246
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Here is a

247
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Surveillance fleshing it out a little bit

248
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,927
Is this a cover for the back of the Chinese economy was imploding

249
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Major civil

250
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Uprising

251
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Definitely not

252
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Okay

253
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
This Coronavirus

254
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
Is conclusively from the tsar's family

255
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
The Communist Chinese have been caught

256
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
4 * releasing another labs

257
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Doesn't sound like accidents to me

258
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,247
So the implication is now becoming the China release this on itself intention

259
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
They've released

260
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Did four times before

261
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Okay

262
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,815
So first of all it's really important to recognize that Alex operates very consistently in the realm of speculation

263
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
He's introduced this whole segment basically as him spitballing

264
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
So there's no real need for him to come through

265
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
Conclusion and even if he does eventually make definitive statements

266
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,847
That's really just been looking at all the angles or some s***

267
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
So he's speculating the China was a shame that they lost the

268
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Is trade War

269
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
With job which I'm not sure is accurate at all

270
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Face they've launched

271
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,903
The bioweapon attack all themselves that's disrupting their economy at definitely not helping on that front

272
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,255
Right on its face this makes no sense even without analysis this Theory should be dis

273
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
How did the dumbest s*** it's not just throwing the baby out with the bathwater it's never having taken a bath and just

274
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Killing your WhatsApp

275
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
I have to Alex saying the China release ours for time

276
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
I would call him to prove that

277
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,967
There was a the mainland SARS outbreak that occurred between 2002-2003 but since I was dealt with

278
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
There have been reappearance is of SARS

279
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
Is not the same thing as saying China released it four times

280
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
So let's take a look

281
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
It's some of those reappearance has

282
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Spider-Man 1

283
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,607
Spider-Man 2 Spider-Man how many Spider-Mans has there been at least

284
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
It's it's pretty good programming

285
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
So on January 4th 2004 man in southern China came down with stars but all indications

286
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Experts to believe that he was insect

287
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Through human-animal Khan

288
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Which makes

289
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,319
In 2017 the guardian reported on Chinese researchers who would finally traced down the origin of SARS

290
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Do colony of bats

291
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
It was initially believed that the source was Civic

292
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
But further research found that those cats were actually just an intermediate step between the bats

293
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Humans

294
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,423
The same article discusses how another SARS outbreak is very possible given the absence of a SARS vaccine

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
And the fact that animal human transmission could very well happen again

296
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
This is very much likely what happened

297
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
With this guy into

298
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Sounds right

299
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
The rest of them

300
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Are the

301
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
A product of Lab Rats

302
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
In 2003 in August of virology grad student in Singapore was

303
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,135
Exposed to SARS in a lab that he worked at

304
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Anyone else Sonos

305
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
That was one

306
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Reappear

307
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
December 2003

308
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Researcher wasn't

309
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
All the people he had been in contact with we're quarantine

310
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
None of them came down with SARS

311
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,543
Investigation found that he'd been working with hazardous materials and improper settings

312
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Improper settings

313
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
He wasn't using proper protocol and didn't have a

314
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
The correct uniform

315
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Like gloves and a mask

316
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
She had are behaved in ways that were

317
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
Baby high-risk he wandered in with shorts and a Hawaiian shirt

318
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
Maybe not literally true

319
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
But spiritually

320
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,423
Proper protocol in this lab where he was researching SARS

321
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
I like the I like the balls on a guy was like most dangerous viruses that

322
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
You can get me just like

323
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,039
Having closer a lot to put on today you know that's not Saturn of releasing

324
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
Have to be one of the instances.

325
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,487
Savannah April 2004 the Chinese Ministry of Health

326
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Reported three cases

327
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Pictures of SARS

328
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
One of them leading to a death

329
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
This was the result of a laboratory researcher at

330
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
The Institute of virology

331
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
Which did research SARS although this person

332
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Didn't actually directly

333
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Research

334
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Clearly this is where

335
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Virus

336
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:25,503
This researcher that infected the nurse was attending to her as well as her mother who was there at the hospital

337
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Her mother tragic

338
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
We passed away

339
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
But the virus didn't spread further than that

340
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,487
The details of these additional SARS cases outside of the initial outbreak it really seems hard for me to see

341
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Any proof of

342
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
China intentionally release in SARS

343
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Any of them

344
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
One seems like an opening

345
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Shut natural case

346
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
Largely be attributed to poor procedural

347
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Controls in lab settings

348
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
The guy in December 2000

349
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
Three seems to be the product of his own negligence

350
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
The guy with the white shirt is you

351
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455
Not some kind of state attempted bye-bye

352
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
I imagine he's played by Pauly Shore in this

353
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Chinese specific in East Asia and general law state

354
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Horn of money during the SARS outbreak

355
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
An article in Reuters cites a research paper

356
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Total at a loss of

357
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
15 billion dollars in

358
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
GDP just from that out

359
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Is there some kind of motive that I was trying to say

360
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Suggest that involves

361
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Economy is argument is Ludacris

362
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,055
No country would ever release a bioweapon on themselves

363
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
To save face

364
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Or Shore up their economy

365
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Yes just

366
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Yeah

367
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:32,575
15 billion in GDP of China 20 years ago

368
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,719
5 to 10% of their entire GDP wiped away entirely sure what exactly it is but it's

369
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
It's not

370
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
It's a it's a relevant

371
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Yeah so

372
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
The trash bin

373
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
So Alex is like

374
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Trying to

375
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Think about like

376
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Expo

377
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Experts

378
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
Boil coming up

379
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,039
What about people who know things about China has one guy

380
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
I forget his name

381
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
Famous human rights activists

382
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
China open us adoptions

383
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Were the CIA we got in my lives in Canada

384
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
He's really smart

385
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:18,143
What is it name and I can't remember guys get him back on immediately

386
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
What money camera while talking about

387
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Call Vitaly

388
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,079
We don't need to wait till the colors I remember who that it's cheap

389
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
We talked about him but the past

390
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
He's the guy who runs that operation called pink Pagoda which he claims is helping arrange adoptions of Chinese children

391
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
He was the one who

392
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,671
Claimed that he was stealing and human trafficking children and he was doing it probably

393
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
I mean

394
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,583
Yes if he's not making it all up

395
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,191
Researchers who tried to corroborate anything he says about his adoption operations of come up

396
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Completely update

397
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
And when they've tried to ask him for any kind of evidence

398
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
It's to prove his claims reducto for

399
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:04,479
Safety of people I will not prove anything thousands of children that you have taken

400
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
Getting from China

401
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
Thousands of children that you have claimed

402
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,695
It seems like the more likely thing is the

403
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Keys

404
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Scamming

405
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Yeah

406
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
He was arrested in 2014 for having

407
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
Illegal gun which he claimed wasn't his

408
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
He cure currently now like

409
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
He has a bunch of profiles up

410
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Promoting himself

411
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Acting gigs

412
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
So I assumed that if Alex calls he'll be showing back up

413
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
Interesting Lee Jim's acting bios

414
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,623
Like saving everybody in China in China

415
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Do they

416
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
No also his bio.

417
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Do Dimension the time that the Obama tried to kill him or the claim that he was in the CIA for 45 years right

418
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Would be some good

419
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Experience to put on your acting

420
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,519
Explain the experience CIA guy all day

421
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,919
Having metal the way my life in various settings I've come to the conclusion that enjoy all that is brought to you

422
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Part of growing up

423
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,551
As a foreigner coming in from Scotland I was open to the new world and all of its experiences

424
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,391
I did some degrees became a teacher principal College president

425
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Teacher's College principal

426
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
Inside myself in China

427
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Opening schools in Brick

428
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Students back to North America

429
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
Then I did a small commercial for a resort in China

430
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
In love the experience

431
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,264
I refuse to adapt and I refuse to accept that take that down

432
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
I want to see some desist.

433
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
Jim Carrey Rosa complete

434
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432
Someone Alex looks as a credible Source debases positions on

435
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Pathetic level of knobs

436
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,368
Honestly I hope Alex does have him back on because based on his past record Jim Garrow is

437
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,672
The sort of hard swinging crazy dude

438
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,976
But I need to find love for the game again

439
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,048
Yeah

440
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
It's it's

441
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,680
Between the helmet and you know if sagami weren't such a heavyweight

442
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
In the field

443
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,520
At least number two

444
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Like it was Leo.

445
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,712
Don't even know much about China.

446
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Straight 911

447
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
The pantheon right

448
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Stroop

449
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
Unfortunately Alex is actually thinking of a different

450
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
But describing

451
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
Pieces of Jim Gyros resume to him

452
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
Excavator comes up with this dude's name is Steven Mosher

453
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
We've talked about him a bit in the past 2

454
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,264
He was a guy who was an anthropological research student in 1979 when he went to China to do a cultural

455
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Study

456
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
He published an article describing the Chinese

457
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
The practice of course of women to get abortions

458
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Which ultimately led to her

459
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Him getting expelled from his Ph.D program at Stanford

460
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
People like Alex would likely say that you was

461
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
Spell because you dare criticize China

462
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
But the reality is

463
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,952
Published photos and identifying information about the women who were his

464
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Which is a clear breach of ethics

465
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
Fix the put these women's lives

466
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Is it risk

467
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
I want to put this

468
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Too bluntly but

469
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
It's a very serious decision when a school kicks out of

470
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
That's not the same thing as getting

471
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Kicked out of your undergrad program for

472
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
For plagiarism or party

473
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Too hard

474
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Like universities make a

475
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Great investment

476
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
In the people they choose to accept

477
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
For PhD consideration

478
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
And I know from conversations

479
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Doctoral advisors at

480
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
High-profile colleges

481
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Read my dad

482
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,952
Typically schools do whatever they can to not kick out the HD channel

483
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
In the case of vulture

484
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
The board voted

485
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
Expel him 11 20

486
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Bowser try to appeal his

487
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,728
Expulsion but Stanford stood firm and explain some of the reasons they were uploaded

488
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Is dismissal

489
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
One of them

490
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,592
Was regarding a tape his ex-wife had given

491
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
Where he brags about lying about having

492
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Top secret clearance

493
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,248
In order to pretend to be a courier to get a free flight

494
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
From California to Japan

495
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
Why do people put everybody

496
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
Always recording

497
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
He's a fraud guy quiet

498
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
The school also had hired a private

499
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,144
Detectives determined at least one sale

500
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Brother to get purchased for his work

501
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Which is

502
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Suspicious

503
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,568
At Stanford Zen President Donald Kennedy described it

504
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
You seem to have a pattern of behavior

505
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Towards those

506
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
The school was right to expel him you just can't take the risk

507
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
To being associated with someone who would operate that way

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Multiple

509
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Instances of life

510
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Rio this

511
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Disingenuous

512
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
You just like

513
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
This puts your work

514
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
You can't

515
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
You can't do that

516
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Yeah yeah yeah

517
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
Since then he's basically written a bunch of books about how evil China is

518
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
Along the way in 1996 he founded the population Research Institute

519
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
Which portrays itself as a group trying to

520
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
Overpopulation

521
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
But it's actually just

522
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
The pro-life

523
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Legacy group

524
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
The Institute really is just a

525
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
The Catholic anti-contraception anti-abortion

526
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
Front that Moser took over in 1996

527
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
When Paul Mark

528
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
A Catholic priest who was an early leader of the pro-life

529
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Movement

530
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Stepped down

531
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,768
In the ensuing years the present-day they branched off into the predictable hard right talking points

532
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
Like denying climate change

533
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
AcuRite scores

534
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,960
They're very transparent about where their funding comes from because

535
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Of course they are

536
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,080
But it's known that between 1999 and 2002 they received at least 130

537
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,408
$3,000 from the Linden

538
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,504
This is without a doubt a small chunk of the right-wing billionaire body

539
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Coming into that insta

540
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Attitude

541
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Them to push their nonsense

542
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
Alex was absolutely thinking of Jim Carrey

543
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Bass all the details

544
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,560
Garrow pretends he was in the CIA he pretend he was involved in Chinese adopt

545
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Andy lives in Canada

546
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
None of these things apply to Mosher

547
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Alex legitimately can't keep any of his guests nonsense backstories

548
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Because they're all bulshit

549
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
They're all just

550
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Fabricated

551
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Eaton

552
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
To the point where I bet if you

553
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Gave

554
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
Moccias credits is that motion would be like

555
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552
Oh s*** did I make those flies God am I

556
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
Yeah I totally did all that stuff out

557
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Canada

558
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Alex

559
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,792
To get around so you heard at the beginning of the show Alex was saying like

560
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
I got to go off there for a little bit to get my note

561
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
Special rapporteur to

562
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,520
Know if he actually got anything right but he's weird

563
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
The beginning of the episode

564
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
It would help yeah

565
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
Insane what what's Jones doing right now

566
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
He said everything's nice because all over the map

567
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
I am brainstorming right now on air

568
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Not good

569
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Have a pre-show meeting

570
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
What happens if I get set

571
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Play my wife

572
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
It's my fault I can easily destroy

573
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
The show

574
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
And then I got to reset

575
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
So let me just do that

576
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,032
Best I can here right now all that is

577
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
Yeah that's a hockey

578
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Because I'm

579
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
Trying to wing it

580
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
I am

581
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Easily confused

582
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
So Alex is

583
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Big take

584
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
The China situation is

585
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
So far we've seen

586
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Most likely

587
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
And one of the reasons you think

588
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
This is because he's never seen

589
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Such a

590
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Chin

591
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
2 an hour

592
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Expresses that gear

593
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
It's just so stupid

594
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
We can talk all day about

595
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
How bad is it going to be what are they covering up why the giant respond

596
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Comedian singing Feldick

597
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Unified Global Response

598
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
What you never seen before least I have it

599
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Am I wrong with a case example

600
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,720
Okay so what Alex is saying is completely insane and means nothing

601
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:49,120
Is it really suggesting that there hasn't been instances of outbreaks being there with International cooperation before

602
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,472
Really dumb things to say station solve their problems by themselves

603
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
Do you want the case example okay SARS MERS

604
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Ebola

605
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
Zika

606
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,688
What does it mean by unified Global Response

607
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
Use the rosaries rooting for Stars this time around event steak city audit claims

608
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Broadcast

609
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,744
Chili was all-in for SARS

610
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
Chili was rooting for SARS the whole time s2b

611
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Frisbee different

612
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,448
This is the first time they world is united in saying viruses are bad

613
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Going to tell you a little bit about the 2002-2003

614
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
3 SARS outbreak

615
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
You think this is

616
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Unified Global Response

617
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,736
On November 16th 2002 China reports the first case of atypical pneumonia

618
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,832
More cases pop up and then by March 2003 the World Health Organization

619
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
Issues a global alert

620
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
Put into motion

621
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
And international respond

622
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Within two days the cdc's

623
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Established

624
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
An emergency operation

625
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
United States

626
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
And 3 days after that

627
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,400
An international network of 11 labs

628
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Start working in conjunction

629
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Determine the cause of the outbreak and figure out

630
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Gino

631
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
By July 5th

632
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
The World Health Organization declares the outbreak

633
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
With no local Transmissions within the viruses incubation

634
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
.

635
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,528
A piece of the bulletin of the World Health Organization

636
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
Discusses the lessons

637
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
That we learned in the alpha

638
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
The director of the division

639
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
For combating communicable diseases

640
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,304
For the World Health organization's regional office of the Western Plus

641
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Here is one of his main takeaways

642
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Quote

643
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
What was gratifying was the during the SARS outbreak

644
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,032
2003's there was unprecedented collaboration among scientists

645
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,872
And Laboratories around the world to work together to identify the causative agent

646
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
Map its genome and develop reliable

647
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Even in the face of

648
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
The Chili's resist

649
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
There was openness and willingness

650
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
Mr. share critical scientific information

651
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
As a result

652
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
The virus was identified within weeks of the Opera

653
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
The scientific world was shown at its

654
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
It sounds to me like a unified Global Response being discussed

655
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
That article in the bulletin literally ends with a

656
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
This line quote

657
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
No man is an island and no

658
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
Country can fight a global Public Health threat alone

659
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,688
Every single case of a public health emergency will ultimately require unified Global Response

660
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Putting it bluntly Alex's is talking

661
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
You just making

662
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
Stuff up

663
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Doesn't mean anything

664
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Look

665
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Government

666
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
Do so much evil ship

667
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
Why can't for once we all root for the International Coalition of people stopping viruses this is the one thing

668
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,680
Where can we all be like f*** yeah the CDC in the WHL work

669
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Kick in the ass

670
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,056
Why can't we just do that for one thing why does Alex have to be a dick about every

671
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,968
I'm not entirely sure if I could pinpoint it to one reason but I think I might have the constellation of thing

672
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
And what

673
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Play you this clip

674
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
So Alex has decided because the false flag

675
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
Attack the China did on them

676
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,280
Right now it evolves even

677
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Even further

678
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Alex

679
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,192
Is suggesting now that it's a race specific bioweapon

680
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
Meant to just

681
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Attack the Chinese

682
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
That the Chinese are doing to themselves

683
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
And

684
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,224
Nevermind start there

685
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
B

686
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,368
Reveal himself to be a bit of a race

687
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Rachel Science Guy

688
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
But it's serious

689
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
And they're covering up what's really going on and it's a

690
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Just incredible to me

691
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,888
That is so obviously a bioweapon

692
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,728
Obviously race-specific

693
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Chinese

694
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Men

695
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,872
I mean it's so specific the Chinese genome is so

696
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Close

697
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
Weathergroup maybe is white related

698
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
What

699
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
They're just what

700
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Tailor-made for a racist

701
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Don't want to use one

702
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Racism

703
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Kills

704
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,560
A mongrel wishing it was a bad term it's a good term in a genetically being able to fend off against things

705
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
Pure breeds

706
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
You get diseases

707
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,008
So look at British royalty and people that very sickly they're very mentally ill

708
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Is it real smart

709
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
I guess my first response to that clip would be okay hey got a citation on any of that

710
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
I refuse to engage with that

711
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Down for it because it's not based on anything

712
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
It's deeply race

713
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,096
Even if you ignore the part where he's talking about mongrels and how Chinese people are inbred

714
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,936
What underlies Alex's position here is their belief that there's something

715
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,240
Genetically distinct about people of different races

716
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,592
Which is to say that there's some gene or allele that makes it a Chinese person Chinese

717
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,688
And I guess he's somehow you know you somehow proven that this Coronavirus

718
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
Genetically engineered

719
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Specifically Target people with vet Chinese G

720
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
This is completely f***** up

721
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
Swear I'm just going to say I reject

722
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Travis and I'm not even going to take

723
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Dignify this

724
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
With any sort of

725
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
Discussion like it's just unreal

726
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,400
Many many many Studies have been done about in-group out-group

727
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,472
Genetic diversity

728
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,520
Ethically in common with people who are not part of

729
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,848
Your ancestral lineage then

730
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
People who are within your

731
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
We understand as a racial group

732
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
It's this is really

733
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
F****** messed-up stuff

734
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Yeah if he keeps talking like that he's going to be

735
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Congressman from

736
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
That's what you get whenever you get that racist I think you get that

737
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
So Alex Goes further down this road

738
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,888
This is bad stuff

739
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
That road you can go further down

740
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
But we've reached the end of that road

741
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Call God

742
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,432
Bio weapon because you can kill them off

743
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
And not hurt your own people

744
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,880
What does he mean by saying that they're asking for it

745
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,488
So the Chinese government is releasing a race specific bioweapon

746
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
That targets only Chinese men

747
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
Damn do you know what one thing most

748
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
The Chinese government has in common with itself

749
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
Alex is kind of wishy-washy

750
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Whether or not like China did this

751
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,688
To themselves is a false flag

752
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:33,088
Now leaving pretty hard into this being a race specific bioweapon Chinese people are so slow

753
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Similar to

754
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,696
Which they chose to do

755
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't even know man

756
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,608
Chose to have a massive geographical location with

757
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,936
Many different subgroups cultures within and yet

758
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:54,336
But still be genetically similar like does that clip Alex says that the Chinese are perfect with the biome

759
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
Because you can kill them off with

760
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
People

761
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
And I think what's important

762
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Recognize here

763
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
Is that Alex thinks very racially

764
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,368
He thinks very much in terms of people of different ethnic groups not being quote

765
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
He's people

766
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
Can I find that mentality to be racist and it's

767
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
It score

768
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
Also in this scenario who is it that's deploying this bioweapon

769
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
I thought you said you sing the Chinese did because they want to lower the population or save face in the

770
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,312
Or whatever but now it's about eliminating the Chinese without risking any non-chinese losses

771
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,152
Because incompatible with the previous.

772
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Yeah that's incoherent

773
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
I'm guessing you

774
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
And I'm saying it's the globalist

775
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,112
Globalstar in bed with China and want to take over the world

776
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Nothing you say makes any sense it's complete

777
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Trash

778
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
Is a framework of a very

779
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Very racist

780
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Incredibly racist

781
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
A line of thought

782
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
To even

783
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Entertain

784
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Now I mean

785
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
Here's it cuz here's the other underlying truth there

786
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
Is that you don't think

787
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
That means he must think that

788
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Skin color means complete

789
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Genetic

790
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Bricks

791
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,808
White people are completely genetically separate

792
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,928
From black people from Chinese people from all of those defense that's what I was trying

793
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,048
Yeah that is what

794
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Bonkers

795
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
That's it cuz that's

796
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Cuz that's when you

797
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
That's when

798
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
F****** he's he's into this like

799
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,640
Chimpanzees are 97% of the same genetic material as

800
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
Tell me where there are literal

801
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
Some people are Homo sapiens and then some people

802
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Chinese

803
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
In his mind

804
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,160
It's tough to figure out exactly what he believes

805
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Because he's not really Express

806
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,072
The little hints that he gives in a little indications lead you to hang out

807
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Oh no

808
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
That's

809
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
That is

810
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
The if not

811
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Out-and-out

812
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
The building block of a race superiority genetic superiority argument

813
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Problem I think comes down with

814
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
I mean

815
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,064
But problem what problem is

816
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,464
Releasing a biological weapons

817
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
These days

818
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,376
War crimes are within the eye of the poor person getting murdered it's important to nail down

819
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:30,496
Who's doing right because

820
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Crime

821
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
Turns out in summer

822
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Situations

823
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Maybe it's

824
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Not a crime

825
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
Perfectly made

826
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,968
For Chinese and it doesn't do that

827
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
If you were morally going to hit a group that was attacking you

828
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Morally

829
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,136
You would only hit them with something that goes after military age men

830
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Young

831
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Men

832
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
No

833
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
Wiping out

834
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Specific

835
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Perfectly targeted

836
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
So specifically made

837
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Now do you think that just fell

838
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
First I need to get this taken care of

839
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Right off the bat

840
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:10,944
Under no circumstances is it ethical to deploy a bioweapon against the civilian population

841
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Regardless

842
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,296
If it attacks you

843
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
This is very clear in international law

844
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
Just possessing something they could be a biological weapon

845
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
And if not explicitly for legitimate research purposes

846
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Could get you charged with a war cry

847
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
What Alex's suggested

848
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
Is it

849
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
You think this is

850
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
Ethical

851
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
Massive International scandal

852
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Pictures of super super f*****-up thing that he seems to

853
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Be okay with

854
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,848
I think it kind of sounds like a nut

855
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Not even not even like

856
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
You start about something

857
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,504
Even deeper than that ethical country song about morals like

858
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
God

859
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Gives you the right

860
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
So long as you only kill military-aged men

861
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,232
To murder people who aren't even come back

862
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
I mean this is insane argument

863
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
Unacceptable on any level

864
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
Also I have no idea where

865
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
Getting this information that is mostly military age men who are dying from the Coronavirus

866
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,360
Diseases according to a report in the guardian for February 1st they had reviewed demographic

867
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
Information that have been released about people who have died and naturally you'd expect most of them to be people who are elderly or have pretty

868
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Additions

869
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
They mostly were

870
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
But they were five outlaw

871
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
People aged

872
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
36 50/50

873
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
355 + 50

874
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,792
That is far as I can tell is not this thing mostly hitting

875
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Military

876
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Man

877
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,448
I don't know what Alex is talking about beside to sources which you won't do because he doesn't

878
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
1:30

879
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Just trying to find ways to feel good about

880
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
The concept of Chinese

881
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
People dying

882
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
The New York Times published an article with updated information on February 7th

883
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,480
Discussing details about 138 cases that they had review

884
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,576
One of these cases I'm sorry of these cases the median age

885
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
The person who got the virus was 50

886
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,208
The median age of someone who got it and needed intensive care with 60

887
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
They found

888
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
54% of the cases in their sample were men

889
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,168
Do they did point out that other reports of different cases claim to higher percentage of men

890
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Princeton

891
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,288
Lancet published a report about 13 patients in Beijing

892
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Median age of 30

893
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
And 77% of them were men

894
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,992
Both pretty outside the expected range of a broader disc

895
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
Fusion but considering it's a sample of 30

896
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,904
People it's not necessarily meant to be interpreted as representative of the wider population

897
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,536
See that's where we get back to that 77% thing where you're like your full by 77%

898
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,352
Well at the very least that means 77 out of 100

899
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Instead it

900
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
8 dudes

901
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
It's

902
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,152
These things are really important for people to understand like you have to get contacts

903
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
Explorer

904
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
7 / 70

905
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,808
It's so easy people in Beijing

906
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
Specifically like not a representative sample

907
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,256
And in that situation if it's only 13 young men in in Beijing

908
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,608
That means that they're almost certainly people who travel around a lot

909
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Making them

910
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Far more likely to be

911
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,752
Exposed to this all of them

912
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
The median age

913
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
34

914
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,104
So that means there were more younger people represent

915
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
You would expect

916
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,272
But also none of those patients died or had severe complication

917
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
It wouldn't be too surprising if there were a lot of people

918
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
Lacrosse

919
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
To get the virus

920
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,720
Much like people of all ages are susceptible to catching the flu

921
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,816
It's a matter of it being far more serious for older people

922
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Existing health condition

923
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:46,752
The bottom line is that I think all this up because he's fantasy role-playing

924
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,592
But there's something deeply disturbing. This new wrinkle to his language

925
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Who does he think

926
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
China was at

927
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Who does he

928
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,271
You suggesting that someone has the moral right to use a bioweapon against

929
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Chinese military age

930
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Men because of

931
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Something

932
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
I guess what does he do it

933
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,999
That's the these guys are so scared that's why wouldn't you

934
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
Here or when you read about all of the

935
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
The times where

936
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Trump has just been like

937
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,007
Right that's the thinking that these people have that idea that Total War makes sense

938
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Like I stopped reading about military strategy whenever the

939
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,639
They read that some people burned crop

940
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,991
And that's how they won the war and they were like yeah let's start the poor

941
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,111
F***** up Heather Alex making rationalizations for the concept of

942
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
Biological

943
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,231
Like even in a hypothetical scenario

944
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
Anything acceptable

945
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Alex talks a little bit

946
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,423
Suggesting the possibility that

947
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
We dat

948
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
The United

949
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
States did this

950
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,311
As an attack on Chinese military age

951
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Because China is somehow attacking

952
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
That has taken a turn

953
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,711
I told you that I told you

954
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
Jurassic evolution

955
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
Now do you think that just fell

956
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
No in the scientist look at it

957
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
The Indian topside is everybody else's

958
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
That's why the US and China and others who have the genome

959
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
The RNA sequence

960
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
The virus will not send it out

961
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
Why would you say that we can identify

962
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
Because when you get it you know my God

963
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,711
This is a 57 Chevy

964
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
Made now the big question is did the United States watches against China has a reaction in the war

965
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
Your son has been secretly attacking a bunch of stuff

966
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
I think I have the answer on the other side

967
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,399
So we don't get to know if Alex thinks it was us who did this cuz of the secret War

968
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Wow

969
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
Wow

970
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
Be critical masses bulshit yeah that one

971
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,103
I want to straight up suggesting there's a possibility that

972
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Bus bread the coronavirus as a bioweapon

973
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Does China has been attacking us

974
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Just after saying it would be ethically right

975
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
To do that

976
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
Obviously the United States didn't do that but Alex is pretending that we might of

977
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Justifying

978
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
I know that this is a bit of a stretch

979
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
But Alex hates Somalia

980
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,583
So let's say one day Trump decides it's Somali is our enemy and they've been attacking us

981
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
So he uses the biological weapon against

982
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,727
According to what Alex is saying right now it seems like he would have to be okay with it

983
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,823
He's normalizing the idea of using bio weapons on civilians

984
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Peacetime

985
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
All you have to do is pretend their country is attacking you

986
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
This is so deeply Disturbed

987
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
He needs to get off air

988
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,783
Like I can't I can't

989
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
Ya know whenever you're saying that

990
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
When you're saying both

991
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
China and the United States

992
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,279
I have probably also released this

993
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
At the same time baby to kill people that

994
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Either you would

995
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,215
He's very unspecific about what he's highly suggesting but

996
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,543
Underneath it used on normalization of

997
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
The concept of using biological agents

998
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Against

999
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,735
That is a point at wittlake to which the Overton window

1000
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
Cannot you cannot

1001
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Alex's

1002
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Good

1003
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,391
Normal the Deep state

1004
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,207
Yeah right this is really bad for

1005
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
Normalizing this kind of conversation

1006
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,119
He's trying to make acceptable to talk about now

1007
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Is

1008
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
Porosity

1009
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,751
I am and not not just that but another thing underlying it is that

1010
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
There is no such thing as

1011
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,151
Everyone is always secretly but already

1012
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
He's always been if not opened

1013
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,063
Then secretly at work so it doesn't matter if we declare war or not

1014
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
We've already been at work

1015
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
Yeah I mean it like this

1016
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
He's been doing where he's been trying to make

1017
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Infomercials out of Public Health

1018
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Health Emergency

1019
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
That's bad

1020
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
But it's kind of what you

1021
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,839
Back from the school of con man he comes from

1022
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
This is something else altogether

1023
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,239
Just the other day you sang the Trump should Outlaw the Democratic Party

1024
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,799
Is warming up to the idea of using race

1025
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
Pacific bio-weapon

1026
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Punjab Sevilla

1027
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
I really don't know if he knows what he

1028
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,199
He's saying anymore but I also really don't care

1029
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
He doesn't get better from

1030
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
This is how

1031
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
The path downward that were on

1032
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,367
That I couldn't even predicted this kind of thing

1033
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
Call Ben

1034
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,279
You know I was thinking the other day I was literally thinking

1035
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
So many people who like well

1036
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
When you hit bottom there's nowhere to go but up

1037
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
And I was like

1038
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Or there's no bottom

1039
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,847
And I was thinking I've been thinking others just no bottom it's just always

1040
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
She's going to keep going

1041
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,455
And even this damn surprised me that you can go this low

1042
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,831
I've been telling myself there's no bottom I didn't even know this was available on the bottom

1043
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
Also the Indian scientist who wrote the Yunnan.

1044
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
Feedback from fellow scientist was not a tops

1045
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
Alex is just making that up

1046
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
To make that retractable

1047
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Percy more credible with

1048
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Which is not

1049
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
No one else except for a week

1050
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,775
Conspiracy blogs are saying the same thing that scientists said

1051
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,175
I guess Mike Adams is but his website is an extremely right-wing conspiracy blogs he doesn't get to count his other sign

1052
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,271
Factcheck.org actually did talk to other scientist

1053
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
It's about that paper

1054
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,599
Christian Anderson the director of insects

1055
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
Disease genomics at the script

1056
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Research Transit translational Institute

1057
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,047
Told them that the analyses in the paperwork completely wrong

1058
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Anderson said there was a quote

1059
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,703
Misunderstanding of how to perform these type of analysis and said that they were just

1060
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Cherry-picking data

1061
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,847
Timothy Sheehan the virologist the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

1062
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Golden Deli

1063
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Do you know if there are zero signs of human tampering

1064
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
He said that

1065
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Because despite with Alec Steele

1066
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
Keep saying on his show

1067
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,343
Not like no one has the Genome of his if they did say

1068
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
You can't trust him he's only 250 in North Carolina

1069
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,375
Another person who study the virus Trevor Bedford computational biology

1070
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Just to be Fred Hutch

1071
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,031
Cancer Research Center in Seattle actually recreated with a retracted study was attempting to analyze

1072
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
They were claiming to be inserts in the are Nara

1073
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
Actually just mistakes and interpretation made by the Indian research

1074
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
What was claimed to be

1075
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
TRNA work

1076
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
Clearly segments of material that are present

1077
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,159
Closely-related sars-like virus

1078
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,999
He tweeted out all of his materials to so if Alex is so that's

1079
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Where to get his hands on it

1080
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
It's been there on Twitter for at least a week

1081
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
I was probably

1082
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,911
Who's been kicked off Twitter

1083
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
You know he's not really walk

1084
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,543
Walking around in info spheres that include information

1085
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
So

1086
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
All this is b*******

1087
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Secret war with

1088
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,223
Vagina and

1089
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Flushes that out a little bit

1090
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,087
I'm not going to give the US government to pass

1091
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
And say for sure that somebody in the Deep state

1092
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
On

1093
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
The American team in best

1094
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
Enough fentanyl being shipped

1095
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,839
Every couple months to kill the entire world population

1096
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,167
You're like that's what shift in the USPS

1097
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
Not the kill the whole world

1098
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,567
That means a lot of it's not even getting delivered to the drug addicts they're just so much of it

1099
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,639
One shipment they caught coming in from Mexico with kill

1100
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,431
10.6 billion people

1101
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,503
Newspapers at 11 billion

1102
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
It was made of mosquito

1103
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
11 million people

1104
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Took an overdose

1105
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Why you see homeless everywhere laying out

1106
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
Asleep during the day and sleep at night they're not asleep

1107
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
They're passed out on fitting

1108
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,655
So is this how

1109
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
The United States says

1110
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
We told you to stop that

1111
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,567
Is there a specific weapon that kills military age men

1112
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
You want to kill

1113
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,455
Teenagers boys girls white people black people in Spanish Asians old young

1114
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
Will just hit you

1115
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Where they

1116
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
Race specific bioweapon

1117
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
I told you that towards the future

1118
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
I don't think

1119
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
Trump would do that

1120
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,767
Whew for the relief

1121
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
He doesn't stick

1122
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Trump would do that

1123
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
Well fucken now I do

1124
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
I think Alex would do it

1125
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Yeah

1126
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
I don't I don't cut into this

1127
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
I don't say I don't appreciate

1128
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Man

1129
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,223
That's such a terrifying thing to hear

1130
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Alex

1131
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Stinks that

1132
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,831
Sentinel coming into the country

1133
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,927
Response might be to release a race specific bioweapon on civilian

1134
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
Yes that is a

1135
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
Important question

1136
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Questions to ask in the middle

1137
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,167
This horrific s*** that Alex is spewing

1138
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
Specific bioweapon

1139
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
Real know the answer is

1140
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
And it doesn't seem likely that they will be even in the near future

1141
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,895
The basic reason this is the case

1142
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Is that the illegals Jean-Luc

1143
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
What we call Race

1144
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
It's not just one gene

1145
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,831
They're a f*** ton of jeans at sequences that make up each person

1146
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
Individual genome

1147
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
And there's a whole lot of overlap

1148
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Between different groups

1149
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
There isn't just a one-to-one relationship between genes and race

1150
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:17,631
So the view I've seen throwing around is that you could probably make some kind of an agent that's slightly if

1151
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Back to certain group more than

1152
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
Another you pronounce

1153
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Difference in the measure of a cup

1154
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
Couple percentage

1155
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
And it wouldn't be

1156
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
It wouldn't be effective

1157
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
Another reason why most evil villains probably would never decide to deploy these hypothetical race specific bioweapons is

1158
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,111
A common feature of viruses is that once they begin to be passed around

1159
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Mutate

1160
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
Predictive erase specific

1161
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,791
Miss of a weapon you create would even last one

1162
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,839
Cycle in The Wider population

1163
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
It's just not a good plan even from all evil legit

1164
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
No okay

1165
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
So if there's one thing I know

1166
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Every biologist

1167
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,079
It's that as long as you have a sample of say

1168
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
1 or 2,000 people you can correctly assume what biological circumstances will arise for

1169
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
From 7 billion people

1170
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
That's just true

1171
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,111
Humans are so similar

1172
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,439
That you never see wild and massive variation

1173
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Zucker

1174
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
For no reason

1175
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
Alex has zero evidence erased

1176
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Pacific bioweapons Eva

1177
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Even exist

1178
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
Wendy's press to the wall and has to say proof of their existence

1179
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,215
Since the two things you brings up ID project for a new American

1180
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
Century document

1181
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
And that 1997 speech

1182
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
The Secretary of Defense William Cohen

1183
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
In both of these ants

1184
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,223
Altus primary sources are people trying to justify great

1185
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,015
Spending from the US government

1186
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
And race specific bioweapons are

1187
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Hypothetical

1188
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:46,207
Gofrette bring up to illustrate the kinds of dangers we may be protecting ourselves from one day

1189
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,583
Neither of these sources prove the existence of these sort of weapon nor does anything else Alex can point to

1190
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
They are examples of

1191
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,679
People trying to get more money into the defense

1192
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Budget

1193
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,031
If it weren't a British o I would say he watch

1194
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Utopia

1195
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Which is

1196
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,663
Basically it's a

1197
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,967
TV show about

1198
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Erase

1199
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
Specific

1200
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,575
Maybe he did I don't know

1201
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,391
It's likely these people find a graphic novel that

1202
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,279
Reveals a massive maybe spiracy to release a race specific bioweapon

1203
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
To depopulate the

1204
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
Almost word-for-word

1205
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,447
So I don't think Alex is good on

1206
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:33,567
Ciara

1207
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
I didn't consider

1208
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
The KKK seven-years-old - song

1209
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
My grandfather going

1210
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,551
Walnut Avenue Clearwater

1211
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
But that the other Chinese dict

1212
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
Formaldehyde

1213
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:51,999
He wants us to do, because I want to get rid of their populations as wife

1214
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,583
World governments can reduce the population

1215
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:00,447
Please erase specific

1216
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,079
And all and I told these stories before on-air years ago

1217
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
Visionary man my my mom's dad was smart

1218
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
I'd like to apologize I didn't know that Alex

1219
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
His grandpa yelled at him when he was 7

1220
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
I didn't know that he has that kind of high-level Source about how

1221
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Call the government

1222
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Is

1223
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:29,119
Desiring of a nuclear war and that eventually they will release a race-based by

1224
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
A weapon

1225
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
You know it's true

1226
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
I didn't realize I I do all this like looking into Alex

1227
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,847
The sources I didn't realize he was 7

1228
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
Did you not did you not

1229
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,479
Email his grandfather for comment identities basic journalistic ethic

1230
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
So

1231
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,183
The end of our series

1232
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
It's just revealing.

1233
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
In a good

1234
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
B here

1235
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
You know like really

1236
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,631
Insinuated he doesn't think Trump would do

1237
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
The race

1238
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Specific

1239
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
It is on the table

1240
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
Thankfully he doubles down on that doesn't

1241
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Think that the US

1242
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Is behind this

1243
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
Good

1244
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:16,223
That looks like something the US would launch going to be military and you're being hit with

1245
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,319
Channel. It will you head

1246
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
We're not going to operate like that

1247
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
Can you make a phone call

1248
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Ukraine saying yeah

1249
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
Get a phone call

1250
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,631
Corruption of the money they got to redo that

1251
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,983
Truck is completely paralyzed other than promoting America

1252
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
Get some B policies

1253
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
Trump would never

1254
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,943
Name one of them have that over his head

1255
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
No way

1256
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,551
I don't believe so

1257
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,623
We have stuff on the Shelf like this you better damn well believe it

1258
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,439
Stole it out of that Canadian lamp

1259
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,023
I do not like that Alex's defense

1260
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:05,119
Seems to be the Trump would do this because he can't get away with me

1261
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Love to do it

1262
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
In a heartbeat

1263
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:14,079
People watching him dance

1264
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,895
To get people to do his bidding without interference

1265
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Be more of a logistic

1266
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
Six issues na

1267
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
That would be a gigantic

1268
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,575
Maybe Alex is thrilled at the idea of his

1269
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,391
I guess being Slobodan milosevic is a lawyer

1270
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Everybody knows

1271
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
The God hates coward

1272
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
That's the rule

1273
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
It's in the Genesis 1:1

1274
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
So

1275
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,607
I mean sensational

1276
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,143
This isn't saying this

1277
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
The level of stereo

1278
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,751
He's trying to build up surroundings

1279
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
Virus

1280
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:48,127
Aldi's new layers of it's a race specific bioweapon maybe a false flag

1281
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
China's pulling on itself

1282
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,735
Anyhow he of course he does a lot of sales

1283
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
For his products

1284
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,319
And we get to adopt

1285
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,111
On Suffolk that is

1286
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
What are described as

1287
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,671
The opposite of a shark

1288
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,279
Tell you what I'm personally doing 45 Miami and system

1289
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
It's right here it's called

1290
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
50 Park

1291
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,679
Vermilion silver but it's not regular silver

1292
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
Hire parts per million for the same price

1293
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
This is what you guys the best and safest

1294
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
It's immune

1295
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,663
This is what the Pentagon is we showed you in the documents

1296
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Secretly

1297
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Text thing again

1298
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,527
Family

1299
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,415
I'm just saying it's nanosilver it's high-quality and its ingestible

1300
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,975
Not just in Garland spit it out

1301
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
It's what I do

1302
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
And I love it

1303
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
It's sold out

1304
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Before the show

1305
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
Show ended it was sold out

1306
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,031
Oh I wonder I wonder why I wonder wonder why it sold out

1307
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
Because you're lying Apopka

1308
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Product

1309
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
He's take

1310
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,431
These things that are

1311
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,271
Possibly true about the gel

1312
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,439
He's directly applying those claims to the immune gargle in this in that clip

1313
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Way Beyond

1314
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,047
The acceptable and of course your product

1315
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
You're on bearings

1316
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,119
Embarrassing yourself with this

1317
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
This is Terry

1318
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
Hysterical

1319
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,519
You're engaging in really does he really does make more sense it like

1320
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
He is an apocalyptic

1321
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Creature

1322
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,223
Holding wearing one of those box signs on the corner

1323
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,527
Scream about how everybody going to die in hell

1324
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
Mixed with the f****** ShamWow guy

1325
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Events

1326
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,487
It's Philly

1327
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:43,327
Billy know he was the OxiClean guy

1328
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
So Alex agos break and you take

1329
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
It comes back and takes

1330
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:54,079
Calls by this point he's kind of landed on the idea that it's a race specific bioweapon and China

1331
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,895
Released it on themselves as a Volkswagen

1332
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,991
Probably could have done it if they wanted to Absolute

1333
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,783
I'm so he takes calls

1334
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,951
He doesn't like Alex's

1335
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Very much

1336
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,791
We got loaded phone lines here

1337
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,911
Victory in Europe first he says the US release bioweapon on China

1338
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,751
Bioweapon it is man-made. Confirmed

1339
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
Specific

1340
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
That is not

1341
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,967
Why is it such a crazy response to would want this to happen it would be behind it what do you think Victor

1342
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
So you see the way he is

1343
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,575
Framing the parameters of what's up for discussion

1344
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,671
It's not up for discussion that this is a man-made race-specific Iowa

1345
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,719
Now did the u.s. do it

1346
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
That's a good question

1347
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
The phone line

1348
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Alex

1349
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
False flag

1350
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
This college is not agree

1351
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,471
Do you understand that they can inflict a wound on themselves

1352
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
To then get out

1353
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,055
How does a factor losing the trade War

1354
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,615
Embarrassed

1355
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,151
And use that is why the Crackdown

1356
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
Had the police tape measure to that make sense to you

1357
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,575
It's not the most likely scenario.

1358
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,111
13 years old

1359
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Is it

1360
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:17,279
China and other Global it would launch bio attacks on themselves

1361
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
Nautical and social

1362
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Hey Medical

1363
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
I'm just saying what's today

1364
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
Are you saying select possible scenario

1365
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:28,799
See Alex's defensive about this guy pushing back on his idea of the China false-flag themselves

1366
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,079
Aspirus

1367
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
30 buckets to me that he's not so much

1368
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,991
Exploring all the angles as he is visit the position I'm going to put forth

1369
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,295
Pushing back on it I'm going to Tucanos

1370
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
Petty and

1371
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,743
I don't like the way you said that my idea that I came up with literally 10 minutes ago is not the most likely

1372
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
A scenario I thought of it

1373
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,583
10 minutes ago that means

1374
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,495
Right so he gets another caller who thinks that this is a Chinese government psyops show of some sort and maybe it's not

1375
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,799
Not even actually have not even happened

1376
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
It's active it's a bingo I got a bingo.

1377
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
This could be a Chinese

1378
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Communist

1379
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,527
People out scripting it you're absolutely right

1380
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,831
AstroTurf

1381
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,671
Firms are online that are thousands

1382
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,279
He pointed out and they sue us for saying it

1383
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
When they advertise in hired

1384
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
Not able to get the

1385
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
Have the Clash

1386
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,471
Mostly white supremacist

1387
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Tired

1388
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,615
And again nothing against gay people but you know why

1389
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
Acting job

1390
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,783
The bunch of little pot-bellied you know out there for the real Nazi

1391
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Seashell Dauphin

1392
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,855
I hear what you're saying God bless you Maria

1393
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,927
All right when I come back I'm taking 5

1394
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
It doesn't

1395
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,703
Weird that he didn't bring it at Syria but you seems to consistently believe whenever you just rambling Richardson

1396
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:07,103
Gay actors that got hired

1397
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,247
Did Spencer space that Richard Spencer you are a f****** liar and all you did was hire a bunch of

1398
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
Potbelly

1399
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Quotes

1400
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Gays

1401
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,855
Grapes

1402
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
This is a

1403
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Dumps

1404
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,951
This isn't just offensive this is like

1405
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
Give him give him out

1406
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,023
How to get him the f*** out

1407
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
So Alex

1408
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
He doesn't take five calls

1409
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Backing

1410
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
It's not good at taking calls

1411
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
At all ever

1412
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
That's not just today

1413
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Ever

1414
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,567
He gets ready cuz he's got Francis Boyle coming up

1415
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
You got this guy

1416
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,479
Legislation back in the late 80s

1417
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,295
And now is here

1418
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
Comes on out to show all the

1419
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,415
The time every time there's a public health issue to say

1420
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
It is a bioweapon

1421
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,999
And Alex said something really stupid

1422
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
You trust people that have been around long time

1423
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
Are there on record with integrity

1424
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
Figure the truth out of data mean they're perfect

1425
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,263
Doesn't mean I'm right all the time but we're riding 97% on your pillow.

1426
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
Francis Boyle creator of the US by WeatherBug

1427
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
U-joint us coming up

1428
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
You've been right all the time

1429
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,087
All vanilla bioweapons all of them bioweapons releases

1430
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:26,463
Almost makes you think we don't even have actual diseases we just have biome

1431
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
Weapons created by people

1432
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,583
True I'd really is kind of what they think the other day I stubbed my toe

1433
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Oh s***

1434
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,215
Oh no that wasn't that one was actually Stephen Miller

1435
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
Could have been

1436
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
So Alex

1437
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,871
Gets into reading some

1438
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,407
Pump up for

1439
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
France

1440
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,991
Does boil and he gets a little out of line

1441
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
With his his bio

1442
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
And this is one of the leading experts in the world. It's on the medical side of the genome and then that are and a side but also

1443
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:01,535
The UN forces neon nose

1444
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,327
This is a bio-weapon

1445
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
Alex is presenting this interview is it

1446
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
Explicitly dishonor

1447
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:12,031
There's literally no excuse for him to present Francis Boyle as a leading expert on the medical side of things

1448
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,823
Because he has zero background in science

1449
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,127
This is one of the many many ants

1450
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,199
Instances of Alex being unable to stop himself from embellishing things

1451
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,015
Make its narrative less questionable to impressionable

1452
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,575
It's not enough represent is gaster

1453
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,671
Did the guy who was involved in drafting that us statute on buy weapons back in the late 80s

1454
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
And here's why

1455
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:34,047
The claim that Alex is having boil on to make are not at all relevant to that

1456
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
He's coming on.

1457
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
Discuss how the coronavirus is a bio-weapon

1458
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,679
Which has nothing to do with his actual field of x

1459
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Namely

1460
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Law

1461
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
The content of the conversation

1462
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
His credentials to discuss

1463
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
It's pretty important to make up things

1464
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Things to add to his resume like

1465
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
You leaving

1466
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,247
Expert on the medical side of bioweapons

1467
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,783
When he's not at all

1468
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
In the world of gambling

1469
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Is it called a tell

1470
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,391
The fact that I was creating the

1471
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,695
Disputatious aspect of Boyle's knowledge base

1472
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Gives him credibility

1473
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
He has no involvement

1474
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,327
And that tells you that Alex is creating an illusion

1475
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
As opposed to reporting

1476
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,887
We're doing this since your interview

1477
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,751
No journalists operating in good faith and according to ethical standards would ever do this

1478
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,079
Cuz it sets up the interview that's coming up on Ally

1479
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,407
Which calls into question literally everything that's said in that interview

1480
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
You would think

1481
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,735
Yeah and it makes it tarnishes

1482
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
Francis Boyle from

1483
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
The jump because he

1484
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
He doesn't correct

1485
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,951
I'm waiting for Alex to be like the amino acid

1486
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,511
Fly names

1487
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,815
Time in India

1488
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,655
At the 4th

1489
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,495
Interesting glimpse

1490
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,055
It's a fact that Alex recognizes

1491
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,383
I'm probably have pretty much all along that Trump

1492
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
I was having a Thor attarian strike

1493
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,855
That's bad

1494
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:07,487
Strong person in the Constitution. A strong man

1495
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
Nothing you say means I need

1496
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
That is a nonsense

1497
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
Just

1498
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,887
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye

1499
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,751
He comes back from break and gets down to business and Francis Boyle

1500
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
And

1501
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,335
I'm here to tell you this Francis Boyle interviewees

1502
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Dragon

1503
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,431
I was hoping for gold but apparently it's not

1504
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:33,855
Pizza is not good if there is no information that really comes out of this

1505
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
Yes there is

1506
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
Nothing's it Francis Boyle has to say

1507
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
It is groundbreaking

1508
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
There is nothing

1509
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
Vicki knows

1510
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791
And

1511
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:46,655
He just seems like a guy who likes Infowars

1512
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Cool

1513
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
So here is his main point

1514
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
I think

1515
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
That is outside of the stuff that

1516
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
Alex's talked about

1517
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
And it's trouble

1518
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,895
These bsl-4 facilities

1519
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,199
I have no legitimate

1520
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,247
Scientific for

1521
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
Medical purposes

1522
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
They have one purpose and that is to research

1523
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Develop

1524
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Test

1525
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
Used stock

1526
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
Offensive

1527
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,559
Offensive

1528
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
Truly offensive

1529
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,167
They tried to justify

1530
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,495
We're developing vaccines

1531
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
Be true Alex

1532
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,151
Bsl-4 is biosecurity level 4

1533
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,711
And his main argument here seems to be set up like this

1534
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,295
He believes that the coronavirus as a bioweapon that was released

1535
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
From the Wuhan bio lab

1536
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,207
Because he believes that all biosecurity level for labs exist to do is create offensive bioweapons

1537
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,279
Although he admits in that very Clips they also do research relaxing

1538
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
They claim that

1539
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:51,423
That's why it's a girl baby true owl

1540
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:57,055
The levels of biosecurity lab is subject to is related to the relative danger of the things that are study

1541
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,895
Level one is four things that generally don't hurt people who are in good how

1542
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
Level two

1543
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:07,039
Four agents that have a little more dangerous side to them and they require slightly heightened precautions

1544
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
Hepatitis or HIV

1545
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Level three is four things that could be

1546
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
Contracted much

1547
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,999
Easier and can often be transmitted in the air like SARS or yellow fever

1548
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,559
Level four is the highest level because

1549
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,119
The things that would be worked with their

1550
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
Are specifically things

1551
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,959
Is the containment as easily as level 3

1552
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
They're also potentially deadly

1553
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:30,079
Enter things for which we have no known treatments are vaccines

1554
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,663
Past this would have included things like smallpox and Ebola

1555
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:39,295
Level 4 labs are the levels they are because of the security protocols that are required to work with those age

1556
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,879
It has to do with like the airflow in the lab and how that's

1557
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,671
Controlled how waste is handled

1558
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,255
Protective clothing and gear required by the research

1559
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,303
That's what this designation mean

1560
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:54,399
These things not like a ranking of loud like

1561
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:00,799
People who work at bsl-4 is aren't like

1562
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:07,199
Relationship

1563
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
A scientist studying

1564
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Smallpox

1565
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
So these

1566
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,855
They're studying and working within level for labs whether you like it or not

1567
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Francis

1568
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
Are things that could be a gigantic tri-tip

1569
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,023
In the 20th century over 300 billion people died from

1570
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
Smallpox

1571
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
Is Dawning the conditions of level 4 biosecurity lab

1572
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
It's unlikely that it would now be eradicated

1573
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
Does boil can suggest all you want without proof

1574
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,151
These biolabs exist only to create offensive bio biological weapons

1575
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
But doesn't mean anything

1576
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
They clearly

1577
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,735
Servin end of import

1578
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
Function

1579
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
And without them

1580
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:46,879
It would basically be impossible to do the sort of work that's required to come up with treatment and prevention

1581
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
Diseases that could be

1582
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
Plague

1583
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Agates

1584
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
I just

1585
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,023
What do you say doesn't make

1586
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
It is it's

1587
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,911
It's like it's like we don't have any ability to transfer

1588
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,983
It's certain fears General generationally

1589
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
You know like that

1590
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
There's a generation

1591
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,871
Who was so ravaged by smallpox

1592
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:08,895
They would do

1593
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,175
Anything and everything

1594
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Sing 2

1595
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,735
Help get rid of that

1596
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,783
And then once the disease is

1597
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
Successfully at the very least mitigated

1598
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
The next generation is like

1599
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
You know smallpox

1600
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,791
Fox isn't a big deal it's all bulshit that they're throwing out as we don't need to worry about this stuff

1601
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,095
And everything they tell you about now it's back

1602
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,887
Seems that are doing it and all that

1603
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:37,055
One generation was all it took to rid the entire world of the fear of the reasonable fear

1604
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,103
It's unfortunate

1605
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
Also fun fact

1606
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
Come back to earth from space

1607
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:47,039
From places that are thought to have ever possibly had habitable environment

1608
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,855
They have to be handled by a security level for labs

1609
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
But I guess it's probably just

1610
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:56,767
Because they're trying to make a space bio-weapon because the labs are perfect

1611
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,327
Of the Earth's atmosphere would completely foreign things

1612
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
That could be dangerous

1613
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,143
They serve a number of birth

1614
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
Being spotted

1615
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
No real good standing

1616
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,055
I don't really have any reason

1617
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,127
But he might not have any reason to do anything

1618
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,199
It's very unlikely that he has inside information

1619
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,015
I'm passing I have no insight

1620
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,063
But Alex has a sore

1621
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
Unisource

1622
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:27,487
Seems contradictory to all the things Alex has been saying already

1623
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:33,119
Tell me we can have it whenever planning for us or others

1624
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,423
Developing a vaccine but themselves

1625
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
But somehow and they thought it was

1626
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
So it would be

1627
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,127
Continue editor Albert work and then it somehow mutated

1628
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
They don't know

1629
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,455
They can't believe it was an offensive weapon

1630
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
They were developing a vaccine for that that's an accurate

1631
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:58,207
But he believes that this is a false flag

1632
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,511
Race specific bioweapon the

1633
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,351
Government told on themselves to save face because

1634
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,191
Heather being humiliated in the trade war in so they could do populated country

1635
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Aldi's various thoughts

1636
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:15,615
Now Alex is saying that he's fake Pentagon sources told him this is a bioweapon that was being developed to be used

1637
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
Us

1638
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,223
The Chinese lab was creating a vaccine for that accidentally got out

1639
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
This is a direct contradiction

1640
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
Literally everything else you said on this episode

1641
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,135
If the Chinese are making this bioweapon to use against

1642
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,927
Us that kind of contradicts the race

1643
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,207
Specific bioweapons.

1644
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,023
Is that created the vaccine that kind of contradict

1645
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,815
The goal of depopulating China

1646
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,655
If it accidentally got out of the lab that contradicts itself about it being an

1647
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,703
Intentional released by the Chinese government

1648
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,287
This isn't a situation where Alex is considering multiple possibility

1649
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:48,383
This is him within the span of a few hours pretending to credibly report

1650
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175
Entirely incompatible narrative

1651
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
That's right these two things cannot both be true

1652
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
Yeah one of them he's bich

1653
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Hard science

1654
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
Quote on quote

1655
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,623
And the other is not a theory

1656
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,183
It's what is totally real Pentagon sources told

1657
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,279
I'm very strong feeling that Alex is having a field day selling

1658
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,327
The s*** off of the virus pan

1659
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,095
He's creating

1660
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,959
Because that he doesn't really give a s*** of the things he's saying about the outbreak are internally self-contradictory

1661
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,519
It doesn't matter because his audience is very dumb

1662
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,079
And they won't notice super glaring problems does narratives

1663
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Like this

1664
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Doll just building fear

1665
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,175
He's willing to do it however you can

1666
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,199
Cuz beer Translate

1667
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
Flights directly into money

1668
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,319
I will say that

1669
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,671
You do not need to give me any information on boils

1670
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,047
If all you did was play me a clip where Alex said that string of nonsense

1671
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
And then he said

1672
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
That's correct Alex

1673
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
Then I'm like okay

1674
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,679
Clearly everything is b*******

1675
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
If you just say that

1676
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:49,055
That's correct to Alex Jones regardless

1677
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,687
Decisive move Will Smith isn't it I'm not going to say that's correct

1678
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,503
What movie are you f****** talking about you give me all the

1679
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Information first

1680
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,831
You might be you being led down a path

1681
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,367
So Alex

1682
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,903
Destocking to boil

1683
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,999
Pretty clearly was that all he really has

1684
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Go on

1685
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,071
Is that Indian paper that got retract

1686
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
I think that's pretty clear here

1687
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
Just remember

1688
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,935
Major Indian Labs outside

1689
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,751
The Hy-Vee delivery system welded onto it

1690
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:24,127
Welded pressure that he'll US Government others won't send out

1691
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,199
RNA sequencing

1692
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
Because when they get that they look at it and even low-level abs and go home I God this is funny.

1693
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:39,231
$3 bill

1694
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,255
That's not accurate

1695
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,791
And

1696
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:47,679
So he does believe that the bsl-1 through 1234 likes

1697
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:50,495
Be even BSL twos can see that this

1698
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:55,359
Is bulshit lower-level Labs meeting with smaller universities

1699
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,199
Alex wants to act like he's just operating officer

1700
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
Protracted Indian paper roundly criticized

1701
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,551
Fire other science

1702
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
And

1703
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,135
He wants to know what boil think

1704
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,183
A wood boiler

1705
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
That study when it came out

1706
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,583
It was convincing to me including the pictures

1707
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,911
Obviously I believe the Chinese government

1708
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
Pressure on the Indian government to take

1709
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
So it was taken now

1710
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
That's based on

1711
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
His thoughts

1712
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:31,711
You asked me last time boil came up fuse inactive teacher and videos

1713
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
And I wanted to get

1714
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
I want to get a sense of what kind of

1715
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,343
The teacher so I consulted the website rate

1716
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,927
Professor where boil is received

1717
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
2.7 out of 5

1718
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Too high

1719
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
What reduces quote

1720
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,607
Percy theorist but still a fun interesting lecture every time

1721
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Another

1722
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
So quote

1723
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:56,543
This is a great class if you want to get some credit and not have to go to class but the class itself doesn't have a lot of substance

1724
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
Fair

1725
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,847
Another reviewer says quote

1726
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,383
This course teaches you nothing

1727
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
I wanted to

1728
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
This next one's sounds

1729
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Just about right

1730
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,247
I learned nothing

1731
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,783
Master of jurisprudence

1732
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,879
Except a lot of tinfoil hat ranting about the pope and Duke

1733
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,231
You use a mic in a small lecture hall then scream into it the entire class

1734
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
Expect migraine

1735
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
And worse than 1 hour

1736
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Bob belittling

1737
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Over questions with Noah

1738
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
Don't expect

1739
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,191
What actual legal philosophy or hist

1740
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,495
It is really tough to get rid of it

1741
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
The tenured professor is

1742
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
Yep

1743
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
That is the basic

1744
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:34,431
I think you're also there a video Skype interview Alex and Francis

1745
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,967
And his office looks like

1746
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,759
A tornado just passed through it

1747
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:43,647
Far be it for me to judge I don't keep a tidy house very well but his office is another level it looks like an episode of

1748
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,951
Okay it should it's a red flag

1749
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
Alex should go to audio

1750
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
There's only one question

1751
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
I want to know the answer

1752
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
They're not hung book

1753
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
Probably

1754
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:58,239
Talking about the idea of race specific bioweapon

1755
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
And

1756
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,079
Francis Boyle believes they are real

1757
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,895
You know you got the same source that Alex does

1758
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
What's your point

1759
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,759
Specific biological weapons

1760
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:15,647
Yes we've tried to develop them here in the United States under the influence of the neocon

1761
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,975
Who believed in these things that's

1762
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Teaneck record

1763
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:26,911
Is just based on the project for Novak and Century document rebuilding America's defenses which does not

1764
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
That these things are real

1765
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
And again it was a justification

1766
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,359
To increase the defense spending budget of the United States

1767
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,199
Is an example of a hypothetical threat is evil in its own way

1768
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
But not in the way they're portrayed

1769
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,343
Interesting to be in this sensitive like Francis Boyle does believe

1770
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,879
Music the same sources

1771
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,439
Race or

1772
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,487
Pacific bio-weapons do exist

1773
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,791
Whoever does not believe that that is

1774
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
True in this case

1775
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,631
I was considering

1776
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,679
Specific

1777
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:04,799
Chinese abandon blacks are so different than that would not would conclude that

1778
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,151
That is my conclusion Alex that's correct so I do

1779
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,943
This is that

1780
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
So a black person

1781
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
It's not a race

1782
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
I just

1783
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,439
I just don't know how to handle people this.

1784
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
Because this is a combination get stuff

1785
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,607
This is one of those times where you see Alex being under

1786
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Musically

1787
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
Stupid

1788
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
And Eve

1789
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
Yeah he is

1790
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,007
Dumbest possible ship

1791
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,543
Then we are also used

1792
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
To sell in an evil way

1793
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,479
And be a f****** bigoted nightmare I mean you should know that he feels a little bit bad about selling

1794
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,807
Stuff I mean I don't want to care

1795
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
Opportunistic

1796
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
Oh

1797
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:55,231
With very nanosilver the Pentagon

1798
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,791
Homeland Security

1799
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,327
Nope

1800
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
You know what I've been selling it for years

1801
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
Because I do want to find out whatever the best prawn

1802
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:08,799
How do you feel opportunistic Alex is he going to show us like

1803
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,615
The date that he started selling it now

1804
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:15,455
Flashes up with the same information about the Civil War

1805
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,527
You are opportunistic this is 100% opportune

1806
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
Like this is a disgrace

1807
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
And you're doing it with

1808
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,183
I had talked to the owner and the founder

1809
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
All that

1810
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
And

1811
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:33,887
They're just like you think we should keep mine works sell out what do you think we should do

1812
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,215
I believe you should put everything you have

1813
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,055
Probably real I don't tell my audience that what's weight

1814
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,639
And sure enough unfortunately

1815
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,967
You see this is a serious so it's good to be prepared

1816
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,295
Infowarsstore.com and funds are independent Maverick operation

1817
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,831
Oh wow magically

1818
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,135
Magically sales

1819
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,183
For my Patriot Supply

1820
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,999
Hey you say worse

1821
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
I want to feel happy

1822
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,583
Find out this is

1823
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Real

1824
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
Oh my God it's so it's so terrible

1825
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,679
Great coincidence

1826
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,983
It's for me at a time when I really need

1827
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,799
Yeah it just works out

1828
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
Clockwork

1829
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:17,408
So Alex is talking to Francis Boyle and he still was on hold

1830
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,944
Alex is selling his s***

1831
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,736
Just disgraceful

1832
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
You can't feel great about that

1833
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
EXO goes back to boil

1834
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
Like how bad is it

1835
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,976
From your sources at the UN from your own research how bad is this

1836
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,608
You had me so so cold

1837
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
Computer game at

1838
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,984
Johns Hopkins Bill Gates

1839
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,776
Oh my God

1840
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:48,640
Johns Hopkins center for the neocon to fully support

1841
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
Biological weapons and even Essex Pacific

1842
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
Biological weapons

1843
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,808
You ate something app

1844
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
Teaneck

1845
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,928
Tabletop exercise which is really Awards

1846
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,768
Resulted in 65 million deaths

1847
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
Seems to be

1848
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,960
As to where this started

1849
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
Cheer

1850
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:22,688
Madison Lee Spanish

1851
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
Scenario

1852
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
Here

1853
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,904
To scare anyone or get anyone really

1854
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
65 Million Dead

1855
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,560
Best Buy. My problem is

1856
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,448
I don't care what your motives are spoiled

1857
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:48,800
Espousing things

1858
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,896
You are being used as a tool to scare people whether you like it or not

1859
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,432
It's interesting because

1860
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,480
For the most part you know

1861
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:58,784
Boyle is

1862
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Accused of being like

1863
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
More less

1864
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,880
What is conspiracy

1865
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:08,000
Theories on the left side

1866
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,816
Very similar information to comes to them

1867
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Whether it be from a left

1868
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Perspective

1869
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,192
Perspective of conspiracy theory

1870
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,984
Cuz he's using all of the

1871
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,264
The same talking point is our

1872
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,592
Write this is John's Hopkins

1873
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,432
Tabletop exercise that we talked about the daz

1874
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:31,040
Doctor did not real applicability to the actual outbreak that ended up happening

1875
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,064
I'm sure after it

1876
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
Like he's using these same touchdowns

1877
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
The peanut document d

1878
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,696
I'm all all the videos

1879
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:42,048
The same is the same interpretation of the Indian study that was retracted

1880
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,864
Using this Bill Gates Johns Hopkins

1881
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,656
Tabletop exercise Baba

1882
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
What did Patriots really weird

1883
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
To me because

1884
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,032
I mean he wants Trump impeached

1885
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Right

1886
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,592
He has very different politics

1887
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,616
Alex

1888
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,920
They come together on

1889
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
The conspiracies about a new world order or something

1890
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,624
A bad Foundation doesn't really doesn't really matter what kind of

1891
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
I guess

1892
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
Point of view you have after

1893
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,256
I guess not a bad Foundation is still going to crumble

1894
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,280
Yep

1895
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,632
It's suspicious that Trump isn't doing anything if there's bioweapon

1896
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,936
But you must be in

1897
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,520
I assume that's their angle right if it's not doing anything

1898
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,800
These days.

1899
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
How is Trump wrong give us the Nuance in praising G

1900
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,480
President-trump

1901
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,464
Advise that is a bioweapon

1902
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
War

1903
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Turbocharged

1904
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,632
I just don't believe he understands

1905
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,960
Scientific advisors he has around them

1906
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,616
But I thought you had Pentagon sources were telling

1907
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,688
How does this track how does this make any sense

1908
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:08,320
I was just pretending he has Pentagon sources that are feeding him this information about it being a bioweapon and all this s***

1909
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,136
But somehow drops advisors just tell him

1910
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,416
None of this none of this track

1911
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
Text Trump

1912
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
The smartest

1913
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,256
Strongest most

1914
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,560
Powerful most successful president

1915
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:23,680
However it does seem like every time he wants to do something that Alex does like

1916
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
He's been foiled

1917
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:31,616
Right by an adviser or to a globalist infiltrator

1918
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,176
Every time he wants to do something go

1919
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,736
He's giving bad information

1920
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
So

1921
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:45,184
Point is like get rid of these biosafety level-4 Cruiser centers cuz

1922
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,464
They're they're just attacked

1923
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,560
There just for the day

1924
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,608
Search

1925
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,400
As well while we're at

1926
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,424
So Alex

1927
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:00,544
Wraps up the interview and now he's adopted that as his

1928
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,336
Sort of talking point

1929
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
Which is weird

1930
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,384
This is just insane

1931
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,784
We all have guns are houses in a safety

1932
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:15,392
But they're not locked up right or somebody bad gets and then cause a problem that's okay

1933
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
Did the few people get killed

1934
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
Barbie and free

1935
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,864
And overall the good outweighs the bad that we're free in empowering it's good

1936
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
So this makes no sense

1937
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,472
The argument Alex is trying to lay out here is that

1938
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:33,312
As a man says they're working on vaccines and treatments in these bio lab

1939
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
That's for the sake of Public Safety

1940
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,152
And that's why you know you keep a condom

1941
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:42,784
And you know those guns aren't handled appropriately people end up dying and that's just the cost of being free

1942
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
The benefits outweigh the cost

1943
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:48,160
How is that. Totally analogous to biohack

1944
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
I don't understand

1945
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,280
It security Protocols are followed strictly inappropriately some of this research

1946
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,840
Campos a danger and in those cases it could result

1947
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,888
Tried pretty hard to do

1948
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,984
Dispute the fact that advancements in vaccine site have absolutely outweighed

1949
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
The cost of any of this research

1950
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,872
If you don't agree with that I would suggest you look into some of the conditions that don't exist anymore

1951
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,152
They're basically nightmare disease

1952
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,224
Alex can't even figure out how to be against

1953
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
This s*** at this point

1954
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,552
He wants to say it's a race specific bioweapon

1955
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
The Chinese false-flag them

1956
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,208
It was all about attacking these viola

1957
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
Or disagree with Boyle and risk

1958
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,632
Veneer of credibility he has acid expert

1959
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:36,032
Is Alex disagrees with a boil he's no longer useful in any way to validate his narrative but Husker people need to be

1960
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,080
And that's why they need to buy his product

1961
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
So that is not an option

1962
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,176
And US Alex at the now be against these BioLife

1963
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,272
It's just a mess because I was just a pair and he has no idea what he's talking

1964
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,576
About these are topics you can really just

1965
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,392
When I imagine that if the biolabs

1966
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:56,000
Made a gun that shot viruses lilacs would be in real trouble.

1967
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,144
He be like I love these guns but I'm against these Labs I don't know so now boils gone

1968
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
And Alex gets

1969
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
Do what he really wants

1970
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
To do which is

1971
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,544
Rambo about the Bible

1972
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
It's not fair

1973
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,872
Written by some Hebrew

1974
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
Divine Knowledge from

1975
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,504
No God would say no I'll actually do it

1976
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,552
I'll come down there I'll show you how it's done

1977
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
Walk a mile in your shoes right now

1978
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
Lit right now

1979
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,928
In fact

1980
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,256
I won't just physically take the torture in all of it

1981
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,792
I will take

1982
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
All of the San Tan

1983
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
Do that

1984
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,424
Metaphysically then can forgive you

1985
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,704
LKQ on

1986
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,264
Because that's how the universe works it's energetic

1987
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
God's Got to Be

1988
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
Sacrifice

1989
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,640
Between the two

1990
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:50,528
TuneIn because you can't have new Freewheel creatures given that much power you are going to mess up and do evil stuff

1991
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,856
But they just got to make the spiritual decision to go with God

1992
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:56,416
And then God will cheat the rest away to take us out

1993
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
No

1994
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
At this level

1995
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,536
Over there

1996
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
You know

1997
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,656
Indescribable

1998
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,704
Businesses in this isn't just like

1999
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,776
The simplification people here in all this

2000
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:16,640
But there's a lot of rebellion going on against the nature of the universe

2001
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,736
So this is the guy that anybody who's listening wants to take

2002
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,528
Cues on science

2003
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,112
I think that's good I just text wise you shouldn't even take

2004
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,416
Cues on religion

2005
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,256
This is such the same thing of like

2006
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,792
I don't think anybody hates

2007
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:40,192
The Constitution more than Alex Jones Melissa

2008
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,752
The book of Joe is like 90%

2009
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:47,872
You don't know why I do a goddamn thing so don't ask me that's the whole book

2010
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
He's right

2011
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,944
So Alex

2012
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
Birds talking about Trump

2013
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
Same bullshitted

2014
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
That speech

2015
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,624
Alex is still really

2016
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
And he's like hey it's

2017
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,464
It's great that he said it and you get these

2018
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,768
Highfalutin Southern Baptist Christian

2019
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:09,888
They're all against swearing

2020
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,912
This is nonsensical

2021
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:14,240
A lot of family lot of great people and I love Southern Baptist but

2022
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,056
They'll tell you a cuss word is worse

2023
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
Abort the baby

2024
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
Wine

2025
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,272
Then they will about aborting a baby

2026
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,088
Salina family

2027
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,648
And it's a Holiness they have a bottle

2028
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,696
Talk to your f****** family then

2029
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,256
I don't know who these Southern Baptist are who are

2030
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
I don't know

2031
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,072
He's just complaining about his family

2032
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,120
Eddie White the bulshit thing

2033
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,912
Becomes a little bit of a theme

2034
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,192
And Alex starts talking

2035
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,472
Etymology

2036
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:50,080
And I think you might be a little off bulshit comes from

2037
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:54,944
And it's pretty great okay let's hear the Bible doesn't say using

2038
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,808
English before the Norman to cover

2039
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
Hamilton thousand years ago

2040
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,416
For the Vikings took over England

2041
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,256
They came in a band the entire language

2042
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
Bubba socks

2043
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,096
It was only the

2044
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,376
The cuss words

2045
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,472
The continued on the plastic things people say

2046
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
Like

2047
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
Bulshit

2048
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
They found two thousand-year-old

2049
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
Plastic shades

2050
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
Something is

2051
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,736
Call something

2052
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,296
What are the weird reason I had

2053
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
But yes

2054
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:38,464
2000 year-old Anglo-Saxons

2055
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,488
Damn

2056
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,560
2000 year old Anglo-Saxon

2057
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,608
It's linguista Tracy origin of the word bulge

2058
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:49,216
1950s

2059
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:55,616
TS Eliot poem the Triumph of b*******

2060
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
What time is it

2061
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:03,040
The Anglo-Saxon even after the time of the Norman invasion

2062
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:07,904
There's some suggestions that the word Bullhead connotation with the idea of something being gone

2063
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,744
But that's most likely due to the old French word for fraud which is

2064
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,560
I very strongly think that Alex is making

2065
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,352
You should up Dre make it seem more important

2066
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Trump said b*******

2067
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,680
Speech is he's really really hung up on

2068
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:26,848
So Alex is really convinced that it's Old English stuff and somehow about Free Speech issues or something I don't know

2069
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,872
But he really gets

2070
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,896
Excited about this

2071
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,480
And he ends up working himself up into a frenzy where he swears

2072
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:36,064
And they have to cut it out of the bus

2073
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,048
Is a lot of sounds good then that friend good work

2074
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
Describe the two

2075
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,376
A lot of different meaning

2076
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
What you got

2077
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
I'm going to

2078
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
That was a great

2079
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:58,592
It's got a lot of meetings it's a nice word that was a great

2080
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,128
We didn't do anything about

2081
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:06,528
50 million

2082
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,808
So good all day

2083
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,464
What a lucky

2084
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:25,984
It's like what they used to bleep out the whole in a******

2085
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,800
What's so great about that is it I didn't edit

2086
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,104
That's how the show came out

2087
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,688
It so clearly the delay recognize

2088
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,528
Alright Alex is on a rant about how he's going to use swearing

2089
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:42,368
Because president did we can't do that

2090
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,904
Man

2091
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
What address

2092
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,000
That's funny

2093
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Strongly enough

2094
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,304
To capture Alex

2095
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
Feelings

2096
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
He loves

2097
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
The Trump said b*******

2098
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,448
Is the enemy

2099
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
Not the president

2100
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,776
Using Old English

2101
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
Thousand years old

2102
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,408
Norman nobility

2103
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Jordan 1

2104
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,392
Anglo-Saxon wee Scottish but even gets it more

2105
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,952
That is the sexiest thing I've seen a while

2106
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Politically

2107
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,512
Politically

2108
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
F****** insane

2109
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:28,448
I thought there's no bottom and somehow this bottom is even weird

2110
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,360
Trump saying b******* is the sexiest

2111
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,920
Do we live in 2020

2112
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,456
I want to live elsewhere

2113
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
I want to listen

2114
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:46,880
I don't know 2,000 years ago with my other Anglo-Saxon Brothers dad

2115
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
Notable at all

2116
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,000
These calls something

2117
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,792
Absurd but I think he thinks

2118
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
True

2119
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376
And Sarah

2120
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
Anna Lane

2121
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:05,056
I appreciate you

2122
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,592
3 minutes 4 minutes

2123
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
He said he took 30 calls

2124
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,504
He probably took five.

2125
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,880
I think he thinks he took 30 calls

2126
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,184
Nitrogen even cut a clipper

2127
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:27,840
I just thought I'd guy who cares I'm really give a s***

2128
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,656
Before this show take 40

2129
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:35,264
I do like the perception that he's getting a lot more done

2130
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Which may be Universal he's not

2131
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,872
Just rewriting world events

2132
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,920
But his own events as well

2133
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,736
Yeah in that he's in the middle

2134
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
Is there he lives in

2135
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,832
Hayirli fictional life

2136
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
And he should be in hell and I home

2137
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,232
Or somewhere to help him the last quote from February 7th

2138
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,512
This Friday show

2139
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
Up to this point we seem like

2140
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
Real indication

2141
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,400
Irresponsibly and possibly

2142
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,448
Against regulations

2143
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,752
Selling of

2144
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,800
Yeah and I think the

2145
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,568
This clip

2146
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,592
He's dead to rights

2147
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,384
He is breaking advertising

2148
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
In laws

2149
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:17,504
While the same time your family is a 360win

2150
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,528
We have

2151
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,112
Charmaine 16oz Super Silver

2152
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
Nano silver

2153
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,792
It is

2154
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:34,912
Sold out we have the 10 pops lr3 I'm still available to be sold out at current rates my week and a half

2155
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,752
This is the most explicit I've seen where he's talking about a condition

2156
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
And a product

2157
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,848
Which are the two constituent pieces that you need

2158
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,128
To be making a healthcare

2159
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,664
I

2160
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,016
From everything I've read up on and I understand about how the FDA

2161
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
This is a breach

2162
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:59,744
And now he needs to notify the FDA and he has 30 days to stay with that claim

2163
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,840
So this needs to happen there's this

2164
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
It's on

2165
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
Fathomable to me

2166
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
That he would be

2167
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,288
So wiped out financially by his misconduct

2168
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,056
It's with

2169
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,592
Sandy Hook

2170
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Situation

2171
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
And then

2172
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,176
Claw his way out of it by

2173
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,224
Illegally selling products

2174
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,040
No it doesn't make sense

2175
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,344
And that's why I cannot be allowed to happen

2176
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,880
He needs to be stopped

2177
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:32,000
Since is f***** up I would have to stop there and we have an episode about the seven

2178
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:37,888
Development of Alex specific bio-weapon

2179
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,936
In for it cuz our genome is all the same

2180
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
Woo

2181
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
Willow

2182
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
What the f***

2183
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,032
Is that sad that's a departure

2184
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,848
Normalizing the discussion

2185
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,176
A hypothetical release of biological

2186
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,968
This is totally unacceptable

2187
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,272
But then I saw that he did this emerging

2188
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,808
Broadcast on the 8th

2189
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,832
Yeah and

2190
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
This

2191
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Is

2192
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
Wild

2193
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
Stop

2194
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
And my friend

2195
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,256
We are here with you on

2196
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
Saturday

2197
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,840
Afternoon with an emergency

2198
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Broadcast

2199
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,936
President Trump announce

2200
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,544
Science advisor who heads up major federal

2201
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
Anthony

2202
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
Fauci

2203
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,152
Did they are investigating

2204
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,944
The novel Coronavirus

2205
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
Out of China

2206
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,992
As

2207
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,552
A man-made biological weapon

2208
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
And they called for other

2209
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,368
Scientific Institute

2210
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,160
And the general

2211
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
Scientific community

2212
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
And the media

2213
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,048
To look into that

2214
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,608
So this is a story that has one source

2215
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,144
And it's Zero Hedge

2216
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:45,472
Which is really going on the leading end

2217
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:49,312
Spreading false information about the Coronavirus

2218
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,872
Cousin being kicked off Twitter after accusing

2219
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
Chinese scientist

2220
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,432
Creative

2221
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,504
Wonder if they're getting any AD revenue from my page

2222
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296
I don't know

2223
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:03,136
Anyway I'm not even going to ever listen to zerohedge so I checked out their site

2224
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,928
And I wanted to find their source

2225
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,696
On the story

2226
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,280
Resources in ABC News article at the headline quote

2227
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,816
White House ask scientist

2228
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,608
Investigate origins of Coronavirus

2229
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,656
Important note

2230
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,216
This is not breaking news that requires an

2231
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,752
Saturday show for Alex

2232
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,032
This article is published

2233
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,056
February 6th

2234
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
Which was Thursday

2235
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,872
Prior to his Friday show

2236
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,968
You have no idea this even happen to know what his insurance on the Zero Hedge article

2237
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,272
Just a shity process for a news Outlet

2238
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,576
The first paragraph

2239
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
This ABC news story is this

2240
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:40,768
Thursday asked you a scientist to medical researchers to investigate the scientific origin

2241
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,048
Novel Coronavirus

2242
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:45,120
As misinformation about the outbreak spreads online

2243
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,448
That doesn't sound like you're coming out

2244
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,752
Sayings is the bioweapon but I guess that's

2245
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,312
It certainly is

2246
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,128
To lie we that that is

2247
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
That should have been

2248
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:02,528
That should be very obvious that the article about how information is being spread

2249
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,808
Disinformation

2250
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,088
Being spread is used

2251
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,112
Of course to spread this

2252
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
Naturally

2253
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,232
This article is literally about the director of The White House Office of science

2254
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,536
The technology policy Kevin

2255
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
K

2256
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
Droga Meijer

2257
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:21,984
Being worried about the that retracted Indian paper which quote had shown the urgency for accurate information about the

2258
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,008
Genesis of this outfit

2259
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,056
This guy was worried

2260
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,872
About have this paper which was deeply flawed and retracted

2261
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,176
It resulted in The Barrage of misinformation

2262
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:35,040
I want to make sure that the National Academy of Sciences was able to answer the questions people had

2263
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
Would you let them

2264
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Except

2265
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,856
Play flogging retract

2266
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,624
The paper is

2267
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,392
Accurate

2268
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:44,256
Important to keep in mind that paper is one of Oz only sources for the claims that he makes

2269
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
The bioweapon

2270
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,400
The only thing close to helping Alex is there this year which is coincidental either

2271
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,216
The part of that ABC News article that zerohedge quote

2272
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,752
It's from dr. Anthony fauci

2273
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,848
The director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases

2274
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,384
He's asked

2275
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,200
Quote about concerns that stem from misinformation

2276
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,504
Online that the novel Coronavirus

2277
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,296
Engineered or deliberately released

2278
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,088
His response is

2279
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Quote

2280
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,392
There's always that concern

2281
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,464
What are the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at

2282
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,024
Sequences to see if there's even a possibility

2283
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
Likelihood

2284
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
But that's going on

2285
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
You could ultimately determine

2286
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,888
Two people looking

2287
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,168
Now the focus

2288
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
To do about what we had

2289
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,032
That would be something that scientist

2290
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,848
Would rule out guy would say that

2291
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,128
However there's a big difference

2292
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,408
Between what he's saying

2293
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
And Alex has a decision

2294
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,480
It is definitely is Iowa

2295
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,320
He absolutely has determined for sure it's been proven

2296
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
Check the papers

2297
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:49,280
This article is about a White House official calling for a meeting of experts to collaborate largely inspired by the flood of missing fur

2298
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
Formation

2299
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,840
Do the Indian paper that is the basis for Alta

2300
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
In essence

2301
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:57,728
This is about the White House wanted to push back on the very thing that Alex is engaging it

2302
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,592
How many write a twisted version of this article and zerohedge

2303
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,408
Then decided to do an emergency show on Saturday about it

2304
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,176
Declare victory

2305
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,832
While I'm telling you we need to start this media Consulting so here's what we're going to do we've got this

2306
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,856
Consulting firm

2307
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,136
Just

2308
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,720
And what'll happen is anytime a journalist calls look

2309
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,488
Looking for a quote

2310
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
The scientists will then call US

2311
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:24,352
And they'll say here's my reasonable response

2312
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,120
Do this question

2313
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,144
And then I will say

2314
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Do not say that

2315
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,568
Strike absolutely do not say that that is that is a very reasonable response

2316
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:36,128
But they are going to go nuts with it

2317
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:44,576
No right in that article there's two things going on the 1st is the main point

2318
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,136
Of the article is about this K drug

2319
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:49,696
Who's the head of the office

2320
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
Science and Technology

2321
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,792
He's the one who's called for scientists

2322
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:56,096
To get together and work on this

2323
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,424
Sure information like an evil globalist

2324
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,472
Anthony fauci is unrelated

2325
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,288
To that he's just another person that ABC News Consulting

2326
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
Sephora,

2327
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
But

2328
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,360
He is the person

2329
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,384
Who is quoted in

2330
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
Zerohedge article

2331
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,480
Because he has comments that are closer

2332
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,320
To what the narratives they want to push off

2333
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:19,136
The best entire article is about Anthony fauci

2334
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,416
And he is the one

2335
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:23,232
Who called for the scientist to

2336
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,792
This is funny this is actually really funny

2337
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
It's sad but it's funny

2338
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,376
And yes we got the lighthouse

2339
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,656
Main spokes

2340
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,936
The main scientists

2341
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
President

2342
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:33,984
Prompting a

2343
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,288
Appoint him like John P holdren Obama did

2344
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,592
The Genesis to call for population reduction

2345
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Not

2346
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
Anthony

2347
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,200
Fauci

2348
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,552
How to use the chief

2349
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
Science advisor

2350
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,184
Anthony fauci is the director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious

2351
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,720
This disease is Chief

2352
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
Science advisor

2353
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,536
The correct he's just someone who was interviewed

2354
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:03,680
Provide a little extra today ABC News article the person in the White House

2355
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,448
Science

2356
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,472
Technology policy

2357
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,752
But Alex doesn't Nova

2358
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,544
Because he read

2359
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,384
Only knows what was in the zerohedge article

2360
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,920
And they don't mention that dude

2361
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:19,296
They don't mention the office of Science and Technology policy dude they only talk about fauci because like I said

2362
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,576
He's the one who's closest

2363
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
Sister their narratives

2364
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,416
Also Trump didn't appoint Anthony fauci

2365
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
Any position at all

2366
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,976
He's been in the National

2367
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,256
Institutes of Health Center 90

2368
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,280
1068

2369
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,560
Are you going to have the national

2370
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,352
Institute of allergy and infectious

2371
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,400
Diseases something 1984

2372
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,448
As long as I've been alive

2373
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:40,032
He was given the presidential medal of freedom in 2000

2374
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:44,896
84 fucksake man look I'm sure this dude's doing a great job

2375
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
Get him out of there

2376
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:49,248
Get him out of there I saw some pictures of me looks I'm sure he is

2377
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:52,064
Trump did appoint the guy who's the head of the office of science

2378
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,112
The end that guy

2379
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
K drug

2380
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,184
He's his main science advisor

2381
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,976
But he is not Anthony fauci

2382
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,328
Alex has no idea what he's talking about cuz he doesn't prepare and he just does bad work

2383
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,608
Also

2384
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,144
John P holder invited

2385
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,960
Call the Scions are but his official title was

2386
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
You guessed it

2387
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,544
Director of The Office of Science and Technology policy

2388
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Exactly the same as his other dip

2389
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Nothing Alex says means any

2390
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:20,992
But it's really fun really fun

2391
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,040
Answer so glaring

2392
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344
I had such a real bummer the whole

2393
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,624
Like windstar's be

2394
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,232
His second term

2395
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,768
I got here about czars all the

2396
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,584
God dammit

2397
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,680
Editorialize has a little bit about antifa

2398
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,704
Just so far

2399
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,752
It's so funny

2400
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
And I found

2401
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,736
Always

2402
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,576
Where it came from

2403
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
Because it's

2404
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
Very unusual

2405
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,208
I read you all the comment from the ABC letters

2406
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,768
That is a grave Miss

2407
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,304
Characterization of his comment

2408
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,840
I don't know if it was

2409
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,376
I don't even know if he was a depressed

2410
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,776
As it reads in the article it just seems like they called correspondent from ABC News asked

2411
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,872
I don't know I don't know if that's true

2412
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
I think I was just making this s*** up

2413
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,688
Which makes it funny

2414
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,224
He says things like this

2415
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,504
I just got a point out

2416
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,808
What we've reported

2417
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,344
What are guests of reported

2418
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
And

2419
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
I mean

2420
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Ashley to the numbers

2421
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
Because we don't

2422
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,048
Stuff up we really working

2423
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:38,816
Around the Clock

2424
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
Try to bring the bus info

2425
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:44,960
ABC News article would have taken you three minutes to read if you didn't do that

2426
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:50,592
You just read something on zerohedge was like okay fine I was find out where this came from

2427
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,920
Dumbass don't think I've ever seen

2428
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,480
Terminal case of dunning-kruger

2429
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
But

2430
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,784
I think this is going to get him

2431
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,088
So this is really funny man because

2432
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,392
Okay so he's building this up that he thinks

2433
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
Anthony fauci

2434
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,744
She is the main science advisor the drug that needs

2435
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,584
Call Eddie's Blowin the whistle he saying this is Mandy

2436
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,864
No no

2437
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,424
At this is not a name it is ever come up on the show before

2438
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:21,056
This is not somebody that Alex has ever cared about but it turns out Alex has been a long time

2439
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
Now let's look at the facts

2440
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
President

2441
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,200
Medical spokesperson

2442
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,040
Mulatto calls about

2443
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
Legend

2444
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:38,720
A quote for respect

2445
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
Call Roberto

2446
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
This is ridiculous

2447
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,144
I just so sad like this

2448
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,424
You you see this

2449
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,704
And you see like Ugh

2450
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,496
A teenager bluffing a booklet

2451
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:55,360
This is totally a teenager

2452
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:00,992
Absolutely Jesus Christ

2453
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:06,368
Dodging having to do work behaviors are being manifested here but the stakes are very high

2454
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,696
He has a tunnel listener that he's misleading about his products in order

2455
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,464
Cell

2456
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,744
Silver Inn

2457
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,768
Buckets

2458
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,072
But it's still really funny

2459
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,352
The way he's acting

2460
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,376
Oh man

2461
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:21,216
The way he's acting is funny the consequences

2462
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,496
Not so much

2463
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,776
It's it's

2464
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:32,224
He's so f****** confident he's so goddamn confident and something that is

2465
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,600
Entirely fictional it's so easy to see through

2466
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Take the second

2467
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
1

2468
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,208
Yeah just read the ABC

2469
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:45,024
It's very funny

2470
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,048
So

2471
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
Alex

2472
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,888
I want to I want to play this

2473
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,912
CLEP because

2474
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,704
I think this is really purr

2475
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
Perfect

2476
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Inspiration

2477
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
The shity game Alex

2478
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
Let's Plays with headline

2479
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
There's a deadline

2480
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:02,176
Infowars.com

2481
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,968
If coronavirus was bioengineered

2482
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,320
Even ABC News

2483
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,600
With the

2484
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
The same

2485
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,648
Deadline White House

2486
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,440
Scientists investigate Origins

2487
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,720
Coronavirus

2488
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Amy

2489
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
See

2490
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,584
You see how hear how the game is played

2491
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:22,656
Alex's headline from Infowars is just a repost

2492
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,192
The article from zerohedge

2493
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,216
A little spinner

2494
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Intuit

2495
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,264
With added implication

2496
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,824
Houses specifically interested in investigating

2497
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:34,944
That's an unfair reading of the actual article but it's in line with the Zero Hedge

2498
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,784
Zero Hedge article is based on the ABC news story which

2499
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,576
It's misrepresenting by only focus

2500
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,600
Morning distorting

2501
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,880
The quote from Anthony fauci

2502
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
In order to

2503
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,416
Create their spin

2504
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,208
You have this base story

2505
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:49,024
From ABC News which has been added by zerohedge

2506
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,840
Does that reposted with added spin by Infowars

2507
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:55,168
And now Alex is reporting on that story on his show

2508
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:59,520
Add credibility to his stories as even ABC News is reporting on this

2509
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:03,360
It points to the ABC News article that was the basis for the zero head story

2510
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,408
And secondarily for his own

2511
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:10,784
This entire story is just propaganda spinning an ABC news story for their own purposes

2512
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,368
Little weak to them say the ABC News even agrees that's on that

2513
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
An honest Outlet wood

2514
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,744
Just cover the ABC News article directly and accurately

2515
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,560
And then if we wanted to give added Focus to fauci

2516
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:25,120
Peter welcome to do that inappropriate

2517
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,400
What's Zero Hedge

2518
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,424
And Alex are doing is

2519
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,448
Clayton Bowl

2520
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,496
And I say that much like Trump

2521
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,032
To indicate that this is serious

2522
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,336
If you want to see how blade this s*** is

2523
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
Consider this

2524
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,384
No longer

2525
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Can

2526
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,944
The Tail Wag the Dog

2527
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
Here we are

2528
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
Reporting on it first

2529
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,808
Again

2530
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,624
ABC News ass because they

2531
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,904
Can't cover

2532
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,928
This

2533
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,208
Anymore

2534
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:54,560
The ABC News article is the source for the zerohedge article which Alex's reported

2535
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,888
He's pretending he put this article.

2536
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,192
Stop covering up and report on this

2537
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,240
Brazen

2538
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,544
Are you going to see the dates on stuff

2539
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,616
It's not this is absolutely disinformation

2540
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
Nothing like you just watch this

2541
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,456
Rogue

2542
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,224
It's horrific

2543
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:12,992
Yeah

2544
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
God

2545
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:17,088
Damn now this is really great soda practices really great

2546
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
Because Alex

2547
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:21,184
You can very clearly see that he thinks

2548
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,720
That his actions

2549
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:26,048
Cause this ABC News article

2550
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,888
How bad it really is

2551
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
Where it's going

2552
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,192
What truck should do

2553
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Dr. Boyle

2554
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,032
Action investigators man-made

2555
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,592
5 hours later his head size comes after the press conference

2556
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,872
Not saying we did that

2557
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
I told the auto

2558
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,224
Horn

2559
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,040
To your own hard cuz there's a problem with this Theory

2560
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:50,368
That interview with Francis Boyle happened on February 7th

2561
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,928
He's trying to pretend that in response to that interview ever

2562
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:57,280
Call the White House and then drop by the science expert announced they were investigating his by weapon

2563
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
Leaving aside the truck.

2564
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:03,680
DC news article he's basing that narrative on his publishing February 6th

2565
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:06,752
This article predates houses interview with Francis Boyle

2566
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:09,056
It's just a pathetic display of narcissism

2567
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
Embarrassing

2568
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,128
I asked to be wrong about basic

2569
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:13,664
Details

2570
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,432
The

2571
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,016
Saxons were invaded by the North Sea

2572
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
2000

2573
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
64

2574
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,880
Get ready

2575
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,672
Okay cuz we're about to

2576
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,464
Dogs has a guest

2577
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
The joining us on this emergency

2578
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,840
Saturday

2579
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,632
But few minutes while I was ranting

2580
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,912
What should we hit

2581
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,936
First

2582
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,984
Approximation is you been the most active

2583
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:45,920
It's over for Humanity

2584
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,992
Saturday weather

2585
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,528
So

2586
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,576
Alex's Mike Adams

2587
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,392
Most accurate player in the game right

2588
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,672
Here's what he has to say

2589
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,208
First of all

2590
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,488
Anyone in the

2591
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,536
Tech industry or the mainstream media

2592
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,328
That is pushing censorship

2593
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,096
Of those about

2594
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
Who are telling the truth about

2595
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,424
Those organizations are

2596
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,192
Complicit

2597
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
In the deaths

2598
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
That are going to continue to occur

2599
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
Even outside

2600
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,312
They are in

2601
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
Rooting for the virus

2602
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,128
By the nine people

2603
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
We need in order to

2604
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
To be safe

2605
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,224
Be prepared

2606
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
To self isolate

2607
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
To avoid joining

2608
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:23,808
Crowds

2609
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,856
Stay off the cruise ships and all the things

2610
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,392
The people need to do to stop

2611
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,440
Spread to the left-wing media wants

2612
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,256
To spread

2613
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:36,864
So now the stakes of him getting back on Facebook or if you don't let me back on Facebook

2614
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,424
You on the side of the Coronavirus

2615
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:42,240
I I will take that challenge Mike

2616
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,520
Please self

2617
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
Isolate

2618
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,568
Put yourself

2619
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
In a small

2620
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,384
I just said grow up

2621
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,992
I know you want back on Facebook this is getting embarrassing

2622
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
The Tantrum so

2623
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,832
Alex and him talked about like you know like

2624
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,880
These people are created these bio-weapon

2625
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,184
Baby peoples

2626
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,952
Who killed them

2627
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,768
Start over but

2628
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,304
I'm not trying to act

2629
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,352
I was breeding

2630
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:12,448
If you kill a million people in my garage and who I was doing it

2631
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,728
I'm not disturb

2632
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
I'm just at a point

2633
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
I'm just the default is

2634
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,872
People making race-specific wepa

2635
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
Stop

2636
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,944
Is already outlawed.

2637
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,712
Do it

2638
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,760
Or mom's going to come and Lynch her

2639
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,320
It needs to stop

2640
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:35,232
So I mean of course I would agree with him that if people are creating race specific bioweapon

2641
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:37,280
They should be put on trial for

2642
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,608
I don't think it's healthy to

2643
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:44,192
You know do a show where you're saying that anybody who's researching

2644
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:49,824
Zyxi this secretly trying to create offensive race specific

2645
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,616
Bob's are going to come get you

2646
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:54,432
That's a nonsense if even for him that

2647
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,968
It's predicted because what's

2648
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,528
Okay so then we get to that line again

2649
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:01,344
Okay well what's the level of

2650
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,904
Ulric weapon that deserves a

2651
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:06,720
Sherpa should Oppenheimer be hung

2652
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,024
How about f******

2653
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:09,792
Smith & Wesson

2654
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,864
What's the f***

2655
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,656
Yeah

2656
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,704
Real logistical

2657
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
Concerned

2658
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,264
Appointees

2659
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:23,616
Applying legal to kill science pretty seriously saying that

2660
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,688
So Mike Adams is really dumb and

2661
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,480
A lot of his information is really stupid

2662
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:31,040
And one of the things that you can really tell

2663
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:32,320
Love that by

2664
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,112
Is things that he's site

2665
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
Here's a prime

2666
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,696
Neil Ferguson of

2667
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,976
Imperial College London

2668
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:39,744
Is now

2669
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,768
Out there estimated

2670
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,048
50000

2671
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,328
Contractions per day

2672
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
It's not mine

2673
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,168
I don't really care what Neil Fargo

2674
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,192
Some things about the Opera

2675
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:51,008
One guy who's been a past Infowars gas

2676
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,800
Suspicious

2677
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,872
If he said that's correct Alex that he's already done in my book

2678
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:58,176
Second he's a professor of humanities

2679
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,200
With a degree in history

2680
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,224
Austrian philosophy

2681
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:05,600
He hasn't a real standing here is an expert some naturally he's the sort of person like exciting as an expert on

2682
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
Virologia net

2683
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,160
Epidemiology

2684
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,720
Virus expansion rate

2685
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,768
Niall Ferguson has no standing here

2686
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:15,072
He's not somebody who usaitis Annex

2687
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,608
Expert in public health issues

2688
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,912
But he's a pastor in forwards gas

2689
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
And

2690
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,472
You saying what they want

2691
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:23,264
Somebody to say

2692
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,056
The Imperial College

2693
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,336
Go fuc yourself

2694
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,872
Gifts like Niall Ferguson

2695
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,152
Come here and not just that

2696
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
If it's

2697
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
It's not you can't have

2698
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,480
50000

2699
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
A day

2700
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,784
What would happen if you have 50

2701
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:41,184
50000 a day and then 50,000 the next day and then 200,000 and then a million and then we'd all be f******

2702
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:44,000
If you talkin 50,000 new cases

2703
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:44,768
Per day

2704
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:47,584
That's going to progress geometrically in a way that is

2705
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
Impossible.

2706
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,656
That's not a thing

2707
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:54,240
Ferguson he's a professor of History so

2708
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,520
So he's watched

2709
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
So you're wrong

2710
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,896
That's it just a really good example of like

2711
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,664
Who cares

2712
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,944
What you're saying

2713
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,760
Who cares I'm not I'm not going to take that seriously

2714
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,528
Events

2715
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,576
It's just all over the place

2716
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,928
Everything is flawed all of their primary sources all of their data is useless

2717
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,208
The death rate

2718
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,744
Is 6:45

2719
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,512
17%

2720
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,280
What type of layout he

2721
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
Here in a minute

2722
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
China has admitted it

2723
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,096
Prescott

2724
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,632
Accidentally

2725
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,680
The Neil Ferguson's asked

2726
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,960
Professor Ferguson

2727
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,240
Is estimates a fifth

2728
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,264
50000

2729
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,288
The day

2730
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,312
Translate

2731
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,592
To 7005

2732
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:31,360
500 death

2733
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,384
A day

2734
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:39,040
I believe what he's talkin about is that tencent website glitch

2735
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,088
The revelation of this

2736
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:44,672
Higher mortality rate. Neil Ferguson

2737
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,976
Humanities

2738
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,000
Professor prediction

2739
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,328
It's not worth wild so that those are the two pieces sofa

2740
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,120
Over the next

2741
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
E-waste

2742
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,912
Because it takes

2743
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:55,936
Time for people who are in

2744
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,240
It's a start.

2745
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
Spread rate

2746
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,080
And that and the infection rate and the death rate

2747
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,616
83%

2748
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,896
Infection rate for those work

2749
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,664
Supposed

2750
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,200
15% mortality rate

2751
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,736
Set study

2752
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:15,136
Lancet study was not applicable to the general population that was a study of people who presented with

2753
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:18,720
Sample size

2754
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:20,000
You're already dvorak's

2755
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
Stream cases

2756
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:23,072
Not applicable to the general population

2757
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,888
Mike Adams is not dealing with this data responsibly

2758
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
It's in the rain

2759
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
Little bit higher 17%

2760
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,592
Remember the leeks

2761
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:36,640
Data that came out of China where they had the second

2762
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,664
Database

2763
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
Show the real numbers for

2764
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,736
For a few minutes

2765
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,552
It's knocking from

2766
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,624
Again that's just the tencent website

2767
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,928
Glitch that

2768
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,232
Confirm

2769
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,768
Second set of data

2770
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,328
So bulshit none of the stuff they're saying means anything

2771
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,096
Yeah

2772
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,888
I don't like that it seems like this

2773
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:58,912
The only way they have

2774
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,472
It does seem like that wow mean they're making money

2775
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
That's fair

2776
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,312
Earlier in the show

2777
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,592
And on the 7th

2778
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:11,712
Alex has been suggesting that they won't send out the RNA pattern or the sequence

2779
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:16,832
Because if they do people will look into it and I'll find ohmygod there's a Franken virus

2780
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,112
The people have it.

2781
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:20,928
True everywhere not true at all you could probably get

2782
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,952
Get a copy if you ask for

2783
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,768
Search that guy's Twitter friend probably find it

2784
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:25,792
Anyway

2785
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:26,816
That's not true

2786
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,864
So now you have to like Mike Adams

2787
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
Can't make that claim

2788
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:30,656
Because he knows

2789
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,704
But his own websites probably published

2790
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,008
Pieces Of Eight

2791
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
It's nonsense

2792
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,568
Call Anton I got to move the goalposts

2793
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:40,640
Why won't they send out samples of the viruses

2794
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,432
Well

2795
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,992
Because you put that when you pull in your f******

2796
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:50,624
Draculaura is like

2797
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,464
If they did you would criticize them for doing

2798
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:58,560
Why are they allowing these samples to be taken wherever

2799
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,328
It's it's

2800
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,400
They get you coming and going no matter what you do

2801
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:07,520
They're going to complain about the only way to get rid of it is with bleach they be like

2802
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,568
Told you all along but now you shouldn't drink please

2803
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:15,968
Because they've been secretly putting the virus inside what about us people who are made of ammonia

2804
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,736
The bleach

2805
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,296
China has not released samples

2806
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,064
Of this

2807
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Actual virus

2808
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,368
Where's the physical Barse released

2809
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,136
The data about

2810
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
Physical samples

2811
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
However

2812
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,720
Any animations

2813
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,280
North Korea

2814
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,352
10 human volunteers to the region

2815
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,376
Don't get infected

2816
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,656
They can bring it back

2817
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,960
They can Harvest it from their saliva

2818
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520
Good thing

2819
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,848
It's under lockdown terrorist

2820
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,920
Man

2821
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:50,784
He believes terrorist over there and then I'll get it make egg yolks

2822
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,832
Yeah

2823
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,600
A******

2824
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,904
Virgins these Islamic terrorists get

2825
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,928
For blowing themselves up

2826
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,232
Probably bonus virgins out there if they

2827
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,024
In fact all of New York City or something

2828
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
Sing with this virus

2829
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:02,560
I don't know how they

2830
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
System works

2831
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,632
You know they're insane

2832
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,656
Are they think they're going to

2833
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
Get rewarded

2834
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:08,960
It's now

2835
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:11,008
Guess what they've been handed a new way to do that

2836
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
It's a whole new vector

2837
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,056
Super easy

2838
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,336
Releasing United States

2839
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:16,384
CDC will not be able to contain that

2840
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,152
When that day comes

2841
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:23,040
This is exactly the same things they said about ebola is an exactly the same thing they said about all of these

2842
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,576
Public Health

2843
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,880
At Wendy's

2844
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:27,648
Stopping terrorists

2845
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
Spreading it like it's

2846
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,512
This is just standard boilerplate s***

2847
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,352
We're screwed

2848
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:39,424
A screw you because the right is getting

2849
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,192
Too good at

2850
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,728
Did you hear that

2851
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,264
Indefinitely

2852
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,032
He thinks he's

2853
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:47,616
He's great virgin aumix or whatever

2854
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,896
Clever man

2855
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:52,224
I remember being an open Mike's 20 years ago in that was funny

2856
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:58,880
So Mike has other big news though that did feeds into this the sense of panic that everybody should be

2857
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
Feeling and

2858
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
It's b*******

2859
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,208
We're getting reports of

2860
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:02,976
Mass

2861
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,000
School closure

2862
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,024
Are they shutting down

2863
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,792
An entire camp

2864
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,584
This is all across America right now

2865
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,376
Get tonight

2866
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:10,656
Brightwell

2867
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,264
The school wait we weren't they never shut down

2868
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
School systems

2869
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,312
Just because some kids got sick

2870
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:18,848
Now suddenly there

2871
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,128
School closings

2872
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,664
Happening the shutting down the whole campus

2873
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,712
I don't know when he was in school or

2874
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,504
You know I don't care

2875
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,272
Really

2876
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:29,088
Most likely happens every year schools closed during

2877
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,416
Flu season every school district

2878
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,696
It's not every city

2879
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,024
You can Google it very easily and find articles

2880
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,840
Year by year by year about schools closing

2881
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,400
Because of an outbreak of the flu at the school

2882
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,448
It's all the time

2883
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:46,496
Like Mike is a f****** a****** pretending

2884
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:49,824
It's unheard of schools closing because of the flu

2885
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,616
Because it helps them pushes bullshittin areas

2886
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:54,176
This is this is deeply Disturbed Behavior

2887
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,504
We need a government program

2888
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,528
The Truman Show these

2889
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:03,904
I'm saying we need to isolate them we need to build actors around them so they feel safe

2890
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,952
Problem with this plan

2891
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,768
I don't want to watch that show that's true

2892
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,072
Yeah

2893
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,120
So it seems like we just keep them

2894
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:17,728
All their information is just dogshit it's bad

2895
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,824
Noah Atwood

2896
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,848
So stupid

2897
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:23,616
This is insane

2898
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,408
But there's also a level of the

2899
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:27,456
Rank narcissism

2900
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,224
Flying around

2901
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,248
We should have you back

2902
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:32,832
Back on the regular Sunday show in the Monday show tomorrow to really break this down options

2903
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,648
Clearly listening

2904
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,464
That is a reference back to him believing

2905
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,512
Interview with Francis Boyle

2906
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:44,096
ABC News article that came out prior to the interview

2907
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,376
This is

2908
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,144
Lunacy

2909
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,680
Anyway

2910
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:51,008
Jesus despite them being wrong about everything

2911
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:51,776
Every

2912
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:54,080
Everything literally everything

2913
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
Even their own describe

2914
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,944
The things that they know to be true despite all that

2915
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,248
I don't have some

2916
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,808
Where to man

2917
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,600
With a great crew of men and women behind us

2918
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,672
Do you hate we have research what

2919
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
We're saying

2920
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,464
Somebody at 5

2921
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,512
Thousand years ago on the tribe then I'm saying

2922
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:14,816
I just saw shiftplanning out there they got wet

2923
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:17,120
Everybody know what

2924
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:20,192
Why are you tell the truth lyrics by the tribe that's always told

2925
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,728
Tell the truth

2926
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,752
A few times but

2927
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:24,544
I think it's our weapons

2928
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,640
To get ready that's a little lighter in Cry Wolf person gets up

2929
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,688
You know thrown off a cliff

2930
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,992
Don't get out of town but when

2931
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,552
They get ready

2932
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,112
Just landed decided to leave

2933
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:39,904
The point is the ships are landing

2934
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,184
This looks really bad

2935
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,976
We hope it isn't as bad as it looks

2936
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,792
We're not going to lie to you and tell you what we're saying

2937
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,840
I would love to have

2938
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:53,472
Was Alex's confidence about his own

2939
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:58,080
He doesn't recognize that he's been wrong about everything everything

2940
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,408
How many probably does but you can't

2941
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:04,992
Let that show your ass a little bit

2942
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,016
The problem is

2943
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,064
Even if he does Rick

2944
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,624
Recognize that he doesn't know the real

2945
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,416
Truth which is that he's wrong about

2946
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:13,440
Everything

2947
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:16,512
Even if he knows he's wrong about most of it

2948
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:19,328
He still thinks he's right about at least a few things

2949
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:23,936
Diablo's few things he needs to be disabused of the notion that they are true

2950
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:26,240
Everything is fixed

2951
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:27,776
Sitting here saying that

2952
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,544
Hitman

2953
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,080
Two dudes telling it like it is

2954
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,616
You don't ever talking points

2955
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,664
You know what you're talkin about

2956
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,480
Sure you don't call them. There's Zero Hedge

2957
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,040
That's those are your talking points

2958
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,088
You do have talking points

2959
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:41,856
Pinpointer wood

2960
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,648
Everett is that will help you sell

2961
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
F******

2962
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:46,464
Whatever it is that can be sold

2963
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,304
Yeah they're bullet points on a sales exact with you

2964
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,328
Yelp

2965
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:56,448
This ends with about 15 minutes of Alex doing

2966
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,728
Sales pitch

2967
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:03,872
They're done talking about the coronavirus nonsense

2968
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,896
For now and then

2969
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,920
The Alex and Mike have

2970
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:12,320
A little bit of a discussion about to Trump's firings of kernels

2971
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:15,136
Another abusive

2972
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:19,488
It's a retaliatory thing that you know you should have protection.

2973
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:23,584
Okay I can't get it off

2974
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,376
Morcar ball thrown at him

2975
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
And

2976
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,728
Because he's a symbol of nationalism populism he's at his best

2977
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,496
Last week

2978
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,288
Tennessee

2979
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:34,592
And you agree with that

2980
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,872
How is the Deep state

2981
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,896
Just right back now

2982
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,664
There's

2983
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,432
Baddie fired

2984
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,480
Veneman in the Ambassador sondland.

2985
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,504
Should be the tip of the ice

2986
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,296
He needs to talk about

2987
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:47,136
He needs The Purge anybody that's been Soros anybody else any ocon

2988
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,672
Anybody

2989
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
Anybody

2990
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:52,512
Left us because they're all

2991
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:53,792
Play they're all

2992
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,328
Committed to evil

2993
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,888
There's no way they're not going to keep sabotaging

2994
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,424
Trump finally asked

2995
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,192
Again

2996
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,472
The political parties

2997
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,240
Executive

2998
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,776
He has a right to clean house

2999
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:06,592
This is the Trump we've been waiting for

3000
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,176
To not only prayers although

3001
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:10,944
Those Traders

3002
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,992
Sandeep Staters and drain that swamp

3003
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,528
It's time to lock her up

3004
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,832
So that's cool I mean if

3005
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,368
Trampoline

3006
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,672
Do something more extreme

3007
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,696
Dherbs

3008
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,232
Shoring up our clearing out

3009
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,256
Descent

3010
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,048
Within the government

3011
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,072
Eddie on

3012
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
Any critical voices

3013
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,656
Let's say it's good to know that Alex and Mike Woods

3014
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:35,008
See that is the Trump we've been waiting for us as we all know Alec

3015
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,032
A student of her

3016
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,176
Love's ahead he knows that when an autocratic leader surrounds himself with nothing but yes man it works

3017
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,456
Good things happen

3018
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,760
The works well things happen

3019
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:48,832
All I hear is him saying he's very excited

3020
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:54,208
For a peaceful transition of power in Suwanee

3021
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,000
These fiery

3022
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,024
Sure

3023
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,304
It might look like retaliation

3024
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,352
People who testified against

3025
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:01,632
No he just said they were

3026
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,400
Coach

3027
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,680
Might look like

3028
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,984
But it's just because they were deep state

3029
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,032
They were deep stain telepurte

3030
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,312
When is this is the beeps

3031
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:15,200
This is the anti-American Bing remove this is a cancer being removed

3032
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:18,784
And the Ambassador and All of Me removed

3033
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:20,320
They're like the president

3034
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,600
Can't do that so he can't

3035
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,392
Far he wanted his own Administration

3036
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,416
Look dude

3037
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:27,744
Deep state

3038
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:31,072
It was like a visit

3039
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:36,960
Human Coronavirus

3040
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,752
In trouble again here's a job

3041
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:40,288
Leprosy

3042
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
Remax bike

3043
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:44,896
Using real trash

3044
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:51,296
Anybody Trader ex post facto the moment he does something you don't like

3045
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,088
He's been deep State all along

3046
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:57,440
Over the course of this couple days is like a real

3047
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,720
Pivot

3048
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,536
In the coronavirus narrative towards

3049
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:06,656
Like the it's now definitively at the bioweapon that probably race-specific China buy beef

3050
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,704
Volkswagen themselves but if it's the United States

3051
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,776
But it's just payback for Fentanyl and it's totally ethical for

3052
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,568
Supposed to do that that's super weird

3053
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,336
Our stocks

3054
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:19,712
Francis Boyle NES disorder backpack

3055
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,784
This is all very troubling stuff

3056
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,552
It's

3057
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,160
I don't like I don't like where it's going I don't know where

3058
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,440
Emgo

3059
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,768
We saw on

3060
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:36,352
The last episode

3061
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,376
Democratic Party

3062
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,168
That's still in there too

3063
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:43,008
The backburner cuz Alex needs to push all the stuff

3064
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,544
I'd sell the product

3065
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,312
New pet

3066
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:47,360
All right here's my new idea

3067
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,432
We write up some templates

3068
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Alright

3069
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,736
And if you can plug

3070
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,784
Trump into one of these templates

3071
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:58,880
Then you know it's bad because these are s*** written by grbl

3072
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:05,280
And Pro stalinist in Putin as did all of these people and if you can just put Trump in there than we know

3073
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,584
No it's a bad idea right I mean simp

3074
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:10,400
It's been I think people have done this

3075
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,680
It's worked right

3076
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,704
OSHA

3077
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:20,896
I feel weird

3078
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,664
Maybe it's

3079
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,480
I know it was tough

3080
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:31,392
Little lame it's getting laborious that Alex won't stop coming up with new lies that he's reading on zerohedge

3081
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,184
About to Coronavirus

3082
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,464
I think

3083
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
If nothing else

3084
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,768
Anthony fauci stuff

3085
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,304
I think it's hilarious

3086
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,424
That's just

3087
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:49,568
You didn't need to make that live as another one of those lies where he said it was 30 guys and

3088
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:56,224
Fighting off three guys that still an amazing thing you can just see three as we don't

3089
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:00,832
Hopefully the next episode of the

3090
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:07,488
Coronavirus related unless the sales

3091
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:13,888
Out of all that stuff I think we might be able to Black Studio surgery with

3092
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:17,728
We will see

3093
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,032
