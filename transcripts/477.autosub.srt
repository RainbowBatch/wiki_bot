1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
Respect

2
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,344
College B

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
Sit around

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
What's up

6
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
I had a little bit of time

7
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
Do laundry earlier

8
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
And so I was listening to another podcast

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Gas while I was

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Doing my laundry and I was thrilled to find

11
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
That my dear friend

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Old friend

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
I'm over selling this a little bit I've met him a couple times but the new episode of the doughboys

14
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Brightspot

15
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
Costco's Saxbys delightful

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
He said

17
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Nick and Mitch

18
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
And I brought up

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
He doesn't eat anything out of the sea and this is a position that I've had for a long time

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,368
I felt I felt like I had

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,488
Making disposition publicly in

22
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,608
I appreciate that

23
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
In 2 hours

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Eating anything out of the ocean

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
I bought that

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
I'll get it out of here

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:30,016
Not like specifically saltwater

28
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
Okay I think you might have a harder line than I do cuz I think like

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Like seaweed might be okay

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Seaweeds okay

31
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,840
I still think I can find common calls on this

32
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
What are you surprised

33
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,968
You gave me the cantaloupe and your apartment

34
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Trying my best to grow it

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
I recently

36
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Stopped

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
F****** with it

38
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
And it's doing a lot better

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
I'm not good with plants yeah it's tough not good with you don't want to micromanage

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Is this better

41
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Let me give you an idea of how bad I am

42
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Planets

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
One day I realized

44
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Set the plant that my friend has given me

45
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,824
I haven't watered it in Forever

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,176
And I was like this is a whole new Leaf for me I'm really not upon absolutely.

47
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
Send it right

48
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm going to take care of this plan a lot better

49
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
And then when I went to water at the next day I remember that this was a fake plan

50
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
At least 2 years

51
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
I was thinking that the story was going to be that it's a succulent and like you killed it by water again

52
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
You killed it but it was never even alive in the

53
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
I haven't having plants and I'm working on them as is its exercise and taking care

54
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
And also the same time learning Wayne

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
You've got to let it be

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm enjoying that part of the process of

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
I could I could talk over these plants and like

58
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
Just be really worried about every single leaf

59
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Or I could you know

60
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Every day or so and

61
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
You know

62
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,031
Some of the steps

63
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm balancing act

64
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Watering it in

65
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
In the morning making sure that

66
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
I'm doing good I'm doing good I'm pretty proud of myself so

67
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
Listening out there if there's a little bit of a

68
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,279
Slightly different sound apologize for that

69
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
Beginning of this episode so

70
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,495
Hopefully be able to figure out what the deal is

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Jordans

72
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,087
As much as possible Thursday's episode

73
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Something's going on

74
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
Trying to figure out what

75
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Alright

76
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Books inside

77
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
That's great idea

78
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
Is actually this interesting person sent me an e-mail

Text Eric Seebeck

87
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Thank you Eric

Exam

89
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
Next Kurt are they

90
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
You could take that generous

91
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
You could put that

92
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
In a

93
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Little

94
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,159
All right next to cantaloupe

95
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Going to take a little bit of

96
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Time to germinate

97
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Take care of it but

98
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Same time you want to leave it alone

99
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
The focus more on the generosity

100
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
See that generosity

101
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Spring from the dirt

102
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Take that

103
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Do your logo

104
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Call Charity

105
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
That sounds like

106
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Compliance

107
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
Alternate route

108
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
This is very exciting

109
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,343
Is starting to come together a little bit very well reviewed

110
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
Painting decoration

111
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Cross stitch

112
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Time to pray next week guns shooting roses out of them

113
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,103
Percent

114
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,199
D'accord

115
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
It is looking nice there's the beginnings of

116
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
You have stages of your life

117
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
You got the brand new

118
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Plantain you got the

119
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Gifts on either side

120
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Illuminati cards

121
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
Exactly so that's awesome I really appreciate

122
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
More like Christmas

123
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Santhome

124
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
I also like to take Sarah

125
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
Got to have some packages of treats

126
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,175
All over the world I think one box is just polish

127
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,319
I'm in the other one is a scattershot from all over the world

128
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
I appreciate that I actually got a chance to try any of those yet but

129
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Pretty cool

130
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Pretty cool

131
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,095
Yeah and also

132
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,031
We are now to 240 South 3rd

133
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Yes and I have to say there's no chance

134
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
We would ever be making

135
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
As I do right now if it weren't for the people out there listening

136
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
For this to continue on

137
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,231
Jelly Belly flavors

138
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
And orange sherbet is the leader in the clubhouse

139
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
It was the best that came in at 8

140
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Britt broken 70 mark

141
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Which is a pretty impressive

142
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Pina colada not a surprise

143
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,503
No not a surprise

144
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,391
You love a what all goes into a pina colada

145
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
I don't know

146
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Coconut

147
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Play there was a grapefruit flavor and I thought I was actually really well done taste pretty good

148
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
248

149
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Not good love

150
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Jordans

151
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
This at this episode

152
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,855
Strange to me because there's going on throughout it

153
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
And it's

154
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Exactly what we called ourselves out about at the end of the last episode

155
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Which was Alex

156
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
Is definitely going to get into a little bit of a murky

157
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,055
Story where I'm going to play the role the same

158
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
That just made me I love this

159
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
This is great

160
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Libertarian

161
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
Fiscally

162
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Nothing I ever did

163
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
Wow

164
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,143
I mean yeah

165
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
If that's the case

166
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
Everyone who's ever heard of libertarianism is like

167
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,175
The terrible idea sooner or later sure that everybody's been wrong about

168
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Be able to Copper to them but

169
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
So much of Alex is like

170
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Foundation of what his whole operation was about was based on a libertarian

171
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,303
Ron Paul the only person

172
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Being a Libertarian was the stupidest thing I've ever done

173
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
Go fuc yourself you a******

174
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,383
If you do think that

175
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
Why should we trust Iran now is any better

176
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Cuz

177
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Behavior is the best predictor of future

178
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Alex

179
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
Pretty severe situation

180
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
Trump is under siege was basically what's going on

181
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
The prop

182
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
Negotiate to the shot, and others

183
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Admin position for

184
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Loyal forces

185
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
NWI

186
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
On the field

187
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Poor people in that

188
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Rash with the things he's going through

189
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
President

190
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
Rodger Stone

191
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Exactly Rodger

192
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,783
I always love

193
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm just kidding

194
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Insecure about it because yes of course I can hear us

195
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
The real

196
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Sensitive like

197
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
This could this election could go either way and Alex

198
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
But at the same time

199
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
All the time it's

200
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Not close

201
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
The only way it's closes because of

202
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
It's a f****** close

203
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Anybody who tells you that it's not close

204
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Is a Deceiver

205
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
I'm telling you that this isn't

206
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Erica wolf

207
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
That we are an incredible trouble.

208
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
We dominated enslave you and break you financially

209
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Control

210
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
And then you got

211
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
What's the plan

212
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Go to sleep

213
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
That's not true relation John

214
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
I'm out here fighting

215
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
The General

216
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
So you are

217
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Regardless

218
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
We're going to do about that

219
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:41,919
Alex himself talks about her

220
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,207
How is just mad at you cuz all the preoccupation with like

221
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,535
Focus on the plan everything is according to plan

222
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,375
Which is really funny because you know just hired Deanna Lorraine who

223
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
Is there a person who promoted KB in that in the past up

224
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
That's really what are you going to do

225
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Where to find anybody

226
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,407
Like popular on the right-wing grift seeing right now

227
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,271
Johnson keep share resources respect

228
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
The biggest gaming

229
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
It certainly safer to get on that hustle for a while

230
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
I mean like Alex

231
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
Jerome corsi

232
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
I think before it really got as ugly as it is now

233
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
And is comical as it is now so had a lot more

234
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,943
Play around McHugh sandbox

235
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
Certainly

236
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
What are the most

237
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
Convincing things Alex's ever look into

238
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
And then definitely stop talkin about

239
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Nope

240
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:06,143
So this is where things start to go into a real tailspin for the episode

241
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
About what

242
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Is

243
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Going through

244
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Leave that out

245
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
But I mean

246
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Reinforcements

247
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Very serious

248
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
He's going to get into it

249
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
Quite extensively

250
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
He's not good

251
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
A very

252
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Long

253
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,919
Consistent diatribe about his troubles

254
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
He also had some news items to hit

255
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
The first one

256
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Democrats

257
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Runners will begin forcibly arresting you

258
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,719
Contact Tracer which is former Clinton Global initiative or

259
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Honda Accord

260
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Solu

261
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Cast

262
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,423
Or if you say you have a sore throat will let me forcibly

263
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Taken

264
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Jail cell

265
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
So

266
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,015
Sounds sound like a true story to you

267
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,159
Barry Obama was in control the FEMA that's why they had the FEMA camps in Clinton

268
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Oh that's right those clear

269
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Mechanism

270
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,799
There's a surge of cases happening in Ohio right now

271
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
Places where people who's been exposed

272
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,295
If they're unable to do so at their own home

273
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
There's nothing about this squads of Obama Corps members runaground

274
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,655
To give you some sense of how weakness reporting is how Alex is covering this news

275
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,727
Now here is a selection from Paul Joseph Watson

276
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
Article on Infowars

277
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
The basis for a liqueur

278
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
It is not

279
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
People suspected to have been exposed to covid

280
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Denise

281
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Although numerous respondents to the directive

282
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,767
Expressed this concern on Twitter it's a long way

283
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Make up some b*******

284
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,167
People making up really bad

285
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:55,871
There's Something Like lyrics.

286
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
Might have gotten exposed to somebody through work or something

287
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Hotel Impossible

288
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
State being able to set up places where people can safely

289
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
Self-quarantine for a certain amount of time

290
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Makes total sense and I think is a great service

291
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,607
For folks to be able to prise themselves up

292
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
He's reporting

293
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,287
Obama goods are going to

294
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,871
And if you look at the underlying reporting on Infowars it goes back to

295
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Some people say weird s*** on Twitter

296
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
To just kidnap

297
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Houses for

298
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
Yeah cuz it's Obama Court

299
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Trouble trouble

300
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
Tweet saying that word

301
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,479
They were busy beavers

302
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,295
Houses of 80 + people that

303
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Covid lockdown

304
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
The cdc's

305
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Are false positive

306
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Since last weekend but that fail

307
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,727
Alex's understanding denialism reporting

308
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,847
The big news of the government percent of cases were false positive

309
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
That's wild

310
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
In reality woodhouse's misrepresenting is at the CDC announced that only 6% of people and their statistics who died from covid-19

311
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Had no other contributing factor

312
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,719
Taking that number and not attempted to better understand what it shows is basically what people like to do

313
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,815
Surprising that is comprehension skills of eroded so severely

314
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,167
He's reporting this to his audience as proof it over 90% of the test or false positive

315
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,543
The fact that 6% of the deaths were from covid-19 alone not really surprising

316
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,383
Part of the reason for this is that there were a number of these deaths that were due to

317
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
Conditions that were precipitated by covid-19

318
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,295
Which would be listed as it gets from covid-19 and ammonia for example

319
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,135
There are other cases where covid-19 exacerbated existing condition

320
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
A chronic condition

321
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,304
In those cases you do you have multiple cases of causes of death

322
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Very strong

323
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Covid-19

324
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
A further issue

325
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,824
Is that a lot of things that would be considered morbidities are super,

326
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,432
Conditions like hypertension or diabetes

327
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
As causes

328
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Covid-19

329
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
If you just write off all those deaths

330
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,792
Then you can handle the deaths of approximately 45% of the adult population of the United States

331
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,144
Which is the number cited by the CDC has people who have

332
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:02,752
These shoes really well understood here you know exactly this phenomenon as it relates to

333
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
The other condition

334
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Like answer

335
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
It just being intentionally misrepresented

336
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
Making money off putting people's lives at risk

337
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,064
The scary part to me is how Alex doesn't even seem to grasp the

338
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
The talkingpoi

339
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
It kind of feels like he's

340
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,744
Yeah he doesn't even read memes because their two legs

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
6%

342
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
Positives another settings

343
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
Players positivism false positive

344
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Let's do it

345
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
94% fake

346
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Why not

347
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
What is somebody going to hold me accountable for this July

348
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
I mean this hot this couldn't possibly be connected but apparently

349
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
Alex is having some consequences

350
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
It is why

351
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
And here is where this

352
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
We have seven major suppliers

353
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Smaller suppliers

354
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
A high-quality organic

355
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Copper line stop

356
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Compliments that we get

357
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
For the medication

358
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Herbivores

359
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
34 months ago a lot of more late

360
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Stop

361
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
We are going to come by

362
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
The seven

363
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
5

364
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Fox6

365
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Analogous

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
The money you put as a down payment on that

367
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
When we just

368
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
Nothing's coming in

369
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
Distribution Center

370
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
There aren't any more

371
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
I just got a couch

372
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I don't know

373
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
You got it from Wayfair.

374
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
Fox and nobody was happy about

375
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Got to replace

376
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
I took forever

377
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
Situation

378
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,176
Come down and he can't get the products in anymore

379
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
So yeah

380
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
He's a face of like

381
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
I'm screwed

382
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,720
I don't have anything to sell nothing to do with it

383
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
I will

384
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
The next day

385
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
I'm going to resist

386
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
The siren song

387
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
He probably

388
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
I don't know I mean it seems like he needs money

389
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,528
Can say with some certainty

390
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
And maybe it's that he needs money because

391
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
PCS

392
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,976
That is suppliers are resupplying

393
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
I will have nothing to say

394
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
I can have somebody to keep going

395
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
For a while

396
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
You come

397
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
There will be no money coming in

398
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
So what are you doing

399
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
Supply cost

400
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:23,200
Disappeared

401
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
So there was no cost

402
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Yeah

403
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,416
So I bring this up with who wasn't like

404
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,256
Really consistent on this especially in the first hour of the show

405
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
Alex seems like he is just like

406
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
There will be a pain.

407
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
Horrible signs

408
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Maybe if Trump gets elected

409
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Stop Landing

410
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
It's not right

411
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
It is Hell on Earth

412
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
There are

413
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Suicide today

414
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
There are

415
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
The media

416
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Pedophilia all over it

417
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Uno

418
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
That

419
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
People are in for a rude awakening show

420
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
You need to get your storable food infowarsstore.com

421
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
Little telerin

422
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
Everybody's going to die

423
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
When the rapture

424
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Yeah

425
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
The numbers are a little bit awesome

426
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Some of this

427
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
Obviously real problems like people who are dying

428
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,736
Numbers are a little high

429
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,552
No

430
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,392
Steve doesn't count like you know it's like

431
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
It's a b b a

432
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Nothing

433
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
In the Box

434
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,328
The worst possible picture in order to then transition

435
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,144
He keeps talking

436
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,960
About this product

437
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
60 + items like

438
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
Complex formula

439
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
We got it

440
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
This is bad

441
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,376
I find this pretty remarkable cuz like if you take a little bit of a step back

442
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Makes no sense

443
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,800
If you take Alex that is that the supply chain is broken down

444
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
It's the cell you anymore

445
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:03,712
Has not prepared for a situation like the one we're in

446
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
That's okay internet itself

447
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Most of us weren't

448
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
The only thing that makes this really funny

449
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:15,488
When you realize it's so much of Alex's survivalism

450
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Scenario

451
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
Bug out bags and Seed vault

452
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
Entire industry survival food water filtration

453
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Collapses

454
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
For years he sold gold on the expectation that you would need it after the imminent collapse of the dollar when paper money would happen

455
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,624
Just hilarious to see that Alex himself as a businessman seems to have done nothing

456
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
To prepare this business to run into difficulties

457
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,792
Supply chain disruptions

458
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,632
Biblical real survivors might have expected this possibility had a plan

459
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,704
It turns out the supplier

460
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Took my advice

461
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Bugged out so

462
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,896
It turns out I should have had a bug out the book and got freaked out

463
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
Should have taken my own advice but I insisted on going to Idaho

464
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
I'm out

465
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
Even though he has product

466
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
Don't don't think that Alex feel sorry

467
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Sorry for himself

468
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
I think voting for Infowars

469
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
What about now

470
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,288
No I feel sorry for the children of this country in the world thanks

471
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Poison vaccine

472
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Fluoride

473
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
All right. Get more obvious

474
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:47,136
If somebody does that you're just like f*** you I'm more worried about the children

475
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
You're not children

476
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Call won't somebody please think

477
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,328
Children children

478
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
Spending almost

479
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
In my entire show yelling about how

480
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,080
I can't get my product anymore and you need to buy stuff for the children

481
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
I'm just talkin about me because I don't care about the chilled

482
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,760
I don't need to use it

483
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:19,392
Falsified concerns that I have children

484
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
Helps me

485
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,816
So we get to another appearance

486
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
For this

487
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Person quotes

488
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
Positive

489
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
They censored all that

490
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
What is the limit

491
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,144
No that's not a Jefferson quote that's Frederick Douglass

492
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,216
It's interesting Alex's using it

493
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,056
Distributing at we're going into slavery when Frederick Douglass

494
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Who was talking about

495
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
He was specific

496
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
In order to accept the

497
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Punishment

498
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
The thing that

499
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
Actual guy

500
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Yeah

501
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,024
That's really white really white

502
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
I can't even acknowledge Frederick Douglass

503
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Existence

504
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
So Alex

505
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Comes back from break

506
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
And he's got

507
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
A meme

508
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
Up on the board

509
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Sure

510
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
This meme

511
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Is a bigger role in this segment than I expected

512
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,064
If you've seen a hundred of these meme picture of a damn and then

513
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
The late the water behind

514
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,464
The town below is labeled

515
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,096
Of course this is the dam is Infowars the water on top of Communism event below

516
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
Look at this traffic I've got run over here I'm going to walk over here

517
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Hoover Dam

518
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Gallons of water

519
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Unless it's unleashing improper way it'll destroy

520
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Thousands of people

521
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
Communism is held back by info

522
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
And you're down here

523
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,960
The one thing

524
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Types of dams that are used

525
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Like they don't

526
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Just hold back water

527
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
Water energy

528
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Hold It Back

529
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
Summer able to create energy

530
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,560
The water goes down

531
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
This water is great but if it destroys

532
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,056
Suggest

533
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Right

534
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,224
Perhaps explain it that way you could just literally put

535
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
Anything over the water

536
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
And described it as

537
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,416
If there's too much of it it will kill the townspeople below bees

538
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Anything it's a stupid me

539
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
Explained

540
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Yeah yeah

541
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
100 billion gallons of I understand the water and if you don't have a damn it

542
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
People incredibly profile

543
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
The Damned

544
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
Infowars

545
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Trump

546
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Holding back communism

547
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
They're coming for you

548
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Just like Donald

549
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Are you

550
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
And this is real

551
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Tell you again because the Straits

552
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,472
If you want to get the supplements or the books are the t-shirts of the films

553
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
Supplements won't be there in the future

554
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
The food is therefore Now 1 to 2 weeks delivery

555
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
You need to get your orders at not just for you

556
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
How long will be able

557
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
The continued operating

558
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
This system and self-funding

559
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
They Takin are they taking everything away

560
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
So I guess we're in a position or Alex

561
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
Spending almost his entire show

562
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
On this be

563
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Wow and

564
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,824
And obviously I don't believe the problems as severe

565
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
Maybe he's making it up

566
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
The sound

567
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,968
A real lot to make you sick

568
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
It isn't as bad as it's ever been

569
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Vicious and 9

570
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
They got people out

571
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
With

572
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
Contracts out to kill

573
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,472
There are assassins assassins just wandering around

574
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Turn on Alex's light

575
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
I don't think it would be a professional assassin

576
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
No worries going to be

577
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,528
We've seen I know that he has security and stuff

578
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Universal echoes

579
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,672
Just going up to it isn't a good idea

580
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
In the past

581
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,120
Is such that does not seem very careful

582
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496
Holding weekly swim session

583
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Here's my pitch

584
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Alright

585
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,104
If I'm an assassin

586
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
I'm going to use Nova

587
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
That's what I'm going to do

588
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,992
So Alex dies of that poison

589
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,624
What can kill Alex Alex do this time

590
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,584
Show up drunk at restaurants in yellow

591
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Situations

592
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
It doesn't seem

593
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
If he had a heart

594
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
No coroner is looking too far into it

595
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Probably not

596
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,920
I don't even call it a day the only reason any of this

597
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Borders on like

598
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,272
Acceptable conversations because

599
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,600
That the globalists of put out assassination team

600
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Trying to find out

601
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,976
So dumb I'm only using James Bond style

602
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Asinine

603
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,752
And I'm as much as this is trying me my result

604
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,336
I refuse to believe you have almost

605
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Exact same thing

606
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
I don't trust

607
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Classic situation

608
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Not doing it man

609
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
End

610
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,376
Alex says

611
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,448
I'm part of the reason for that is it he is meddling

612
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
In the globalist plant

613
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
And he knows that

614
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
Because they keep telling him so

615
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Is you continue to be the epicenter

616
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
You need to stop right now

617
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
And they're very very serious

618
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
They are moving now

619
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
It's okay

620
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Go to info

621
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Northshore.com

622
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Cauliflower

623
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
I am

624
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Just

625
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Over and over again

626
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,176
No matter how many plans they make they can never pre-plan for Alex

627
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,040
Needs to eat too much of a wild card doesn't matter what your

628
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,184
It gets even funnier when you start to realize

629
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
The devil's plant

630
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,144
The oldest

631
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Personally says god dammit Alex

632
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Spoiled

633
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
Something that Beelzebub did not play

634
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,408
Is a weirdo drunk paranoiac in in Texas

635
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,344
The hubris of

636
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
I am the only person

637
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Who's fooling

638
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
The literal Devil's centuries-old

639
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Play in motion

640
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:03,424
Fruition now and if I weren't here they'd all these open smooth

641
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Alright man

642
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
Delusion of grandeur is like kind of hilarious because it's Alex

643
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
Do you really believe that he believed everything you said

644
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
That's scary

645
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,528
I like to imagine that Daniel got that profit

646
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Just like

647
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,208
Nah there's no that are you telling me part of God's plan is a weird fat drunk

648
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,280
As the only bulwark against Satan himself and God

649
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,632
How thick is a vector

650
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
You telling me to stop it

651
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,360
Food truck out at Barton Springs

652
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
Are you kidding me what does that even mean

653
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456

654
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:57,440

00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
With what we've gotten our coffee

With only enough to operate if I sold

660
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Both my house

661
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
I've got the mortgage

662
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
This place

663
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Operator

665
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:38,400
So

666

Kind of

667
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,752
Baby empty

668
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
Not really all that potent

669
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Okay

670
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
You do that for

671
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Be able to keep garlic

672
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,224
Why me you better fucken

Dance party to save the f****** Rec Center

675
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,744
You better be regretting every time you've done these Marathon

676
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
Because diminishing returns

677
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888

Seems like

682
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,024
Terrible situation financially if I sell both my houses we could go about that

683
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
In that both in a few and I'll be able to right the ship so you wouldn't sell those houses

684
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
Thing to do unless you had some belief it in that month

685
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Busted

686
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,199
Little way to your house

687
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,295
It doesn't make sense is the Destroyer

688
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
Sure you can do that

689
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Scrub home

690
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Podcast

691
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,439
Something like that it's fair

692
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,511
Defeat the Devil you got to have at least 82 Philly

693
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,839
That's what they say about David and Goliath

694
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Slingshot

695
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911

698
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Have the gasoline

699
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,199

Well that would help

740
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,559
What model is here for

741
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:23,935
So they don't end up broadcasting something else that sells ads better it's literally like

742
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
And

743
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359

Communism

762
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Save yourself

763
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
By giving money and potential

764
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
That's such a

765
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,823
You know when you make the full switch cuz now he's a you know he's not telling as he does really do much

766
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,943
Politically really it's it's almost a full-time televangelist infomercial

767
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735

771

00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Behavior

776
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:08,639
I think it's not as extreme with Alex like I don't think he's trying to buy a jet

777
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,479
Easter something going on Sonos what it is

781
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,647
Over and over

782
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415

Emigrate

796
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
What can you say

797
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Hell,

798
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,015
Cowgirl

00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Creamer on the other side

801
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Scotland

802
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Acute

803
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
You understand though

804
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,727
At that size

805
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,263
Doesn't really matter if

806
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,591
Cleaver.

807
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
Molasses

808
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,247

809
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271

811
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,951
Fair

812
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,743
And then there's a hole in the wall

813
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,791
I would be as words

814
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
Cuz it's baby

815
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
It's going to take forever yours look it up but we gotta move in a week

816
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,783
So Alex

Like Easy Love lyrics

819
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Then comes back

00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,719
Any plays this parody video by Brian stelter

821
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791

Say something troubling

823
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,911
Request

824
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
Request from the number one Fox News shows

825
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Literal require

826
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Repeat

827
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,431
Will you make another Brian stelter

828
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
You got it

829
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,855
I don't know if that's true but that seems like a problem

830
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,975
Sad-sad might be a legal issue 2

831
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Look at the White House is like

832
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
Requesting

833
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,143
Create propaganda against media Networks

834
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
I wouldn't be surprised if some ass I Stephen Miller

835
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
They sent an email is like

836
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,383
Memo parody videos really funny you should make another

837
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:26,527
I mean leave it at all

838
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
That sounds like it's not legal

839
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,391
Really effective

840
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
Make me pissed kitty parody video y'all go viral on the things that you're not allowed on

841
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,727
Because he wants to cover the story about all the false positive

842
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,823
And the staff

843
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Maybe

844
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Cuz

845
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Headline

846
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
Bishop

847
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
This one

848
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
Last week

849
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Covid test

850
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
False positive

851
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Broadcast

852
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
Covid-19

853
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
Okay I guess

854
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Whatever

855
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
Different thing that that story was about but

856
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,959
Is a video that is episode

857
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
It says whatever you wanted to say

858
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,383
So I don't know I didn't even try to find this

859
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,807
Justice Dallas

860
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
Yep put a date on it

861
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Whatever

862
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Exactly

863
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,303
So there's been some talk about ready fairly soon

864
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,887
Not sure exactly

865
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
I don't know

866
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
How

867
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
That's too rushed

868
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
What who knows

869
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
I don't know

870
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
I don't have a strong opinion on it

871
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,967
Alex believes it's coming soon

872
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Theoretically

873
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
Memes

874
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Proof

875
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,855
But they've had the vaccine all along

876
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:17,023
In a month they say

877
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,935
That's magic thing we don't have it for you

878
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
They've already developed

879
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
Years ago years ago

880
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
Again

881
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
What ride again

882
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,951
The right again

883
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,743
Doesn't prove anything

884
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
It's at that's all just nonsense

885
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:55,679
Or if you're I don't know someone like

886
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
You

887
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,519
Bei hater I'm not a hater

888
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:05,663
I strongly disagree

889
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
Understand is that Alex Jones

890
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
When he does

891
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,319
Is individual research

892
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,903
He creates can't even find his own headline

893
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
He creates a research

894
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Product

895
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
It's based on

896
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
He's on

897
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
In depth

898
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:29,215
Analysis navigate his own website no one else does this time

899
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,007
Heater

900
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,591
ER word-of-mouth we need yours transmission

901
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,407
Original research

902
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,391
What's going on

903
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Intuit

904
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,935
We the high quality of very low price

905
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
It just keeps going

906
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,847
The more you think about we don't laugh about the devil too much cuz that's

907
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,431
You know we just ignore it but the more you realize what

908
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
The devil being in play

909
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
Vietnamese got their best brains working

910
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,951
A million years old

911
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
And incomprehensible to humans

912
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Yeah

913
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
Autosmart

914
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Smarter than the devil

915
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
Hubris

916
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:40,895
Okay also I love the idea research

917
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
Headlines on drugs

918
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,807
And now it's just reposting articles from WorldNetDaily and like

919
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,903
Gateway pundit

920
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,303
I listen to my

921
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
The base

922
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,167
So Alex gets into talking about

923
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,191
After Trump win

924
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,983
Okay it's pretty dark

925
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,311
There's that you and I are going to a camp

926
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,943
In this political we have to live without the Democrats

927
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
Global sports that don't believe the country

928
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Destroyer

929
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,951
Destroy them

930
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
They started it

931
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,535
So we have to have the outlaw the Democratic Party

932
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:47,199
Rooting out and rounding up all the Democrats

933
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
Locked up

934
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
This kind of conversation just being like

935
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
Add casual

936
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Is

937
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,975
Unacceptable

938
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,559
And it's fine we're going to need some sort of secret

939
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,143
I guess research

940
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:11,775
They wouldn't even bother researching your behavior

941
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:17,151
Fog attic asks like a cool Trump password

942
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,735
Hey you know why it's super funny to talk about

943
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Champs now

944
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
In the present that we're dealing

945
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Is that it

946
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Because it's so

947
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,183
Because America has never taken the Aged

948
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,535
You know you never seen that kind of behavior from America

949
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,327
Now with the climate that were in the sky

950
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
Because Alex is entirely career was predicated on the idea

951
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,407
Full circle

952
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,015
There's a lot of like really not good

953
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,575
Role models

954
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
In the world of professional wrestling

955
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Water monsters

956
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
There's one who's probably the biggest

957
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,327
Because

958
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,351
Famous

959
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
And also

960
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
Complete Freddy perhaps now

961
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Alex lifeson

962
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
But I got to say

963
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
Watch WrestleMania

964
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,063
Andre the Giant weigh like 50

965
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Hulk Hogan

966
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,159
The show

967
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Years ago

968
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,023
Florida affiliate

969
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,055
What is shock Alex likes Hulk Hogan

970
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Man

971
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Hey Brother

972
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,199
Hey brother brother

973
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,319
Did you just start

974
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,647
I think Alex would do

975
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:10,047
Particular line of work

976
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
This group of friends

977
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,007
Alex's just into it because you recently came out

978
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,847
Said there's like a neighbor got a valid and its dog's name or something

979
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
My God

980
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
Great

981
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,551
But he's he's recently

982
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:41,279
Also Alex because he's the leader of the new new new world order

983
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
Earlier

984
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,519
90s the leader of the New World Order

985
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,895
But that's what he was doing he was secretly revealing the globalist

986
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
It was brilliant on his

987
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
Globalist

988
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
Was to allow group

989
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
Is it true

990
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,207
Entire company

991
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
World War

992
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:20,959
Gaston from Australia turns out to be Syrian girl

993
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
Okay talked about a bit

994
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
Exposition of like

995
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:33,247
Hey I don't like a side but also I'll spend all my time talking about how the enemies of a solder

996
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
All this s***

997
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,463
Although I'm not sure if there's much are between her

998
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
And this out apology

999
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:50,655
Talk about how shity interested

1000
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,495
Interesting things like

1001
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
Yeah

1002
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
Old

1003
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
Was choked

1004
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
Under Obama

1005
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,911
Years old

1006
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
She was

1007
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:32,127
SO2

1008
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
Is a complete and utter

1009
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,319
Nordstrom

1010
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
No one's trying to sell that

1011
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:47,743
We're actively trying to keep you from using that as a way to miss frames

1012
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:52,095
But also hey got beat under Georgia

1013
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:55,935
Right

1014
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:01,311
Also I've bad news for Syrian girl about that old man

1015
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,127
Alex's decided and reported

1016
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,991
And so he deserve to be pushed over by the police

1017
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,319
Soap and girl don't see eye-to-eye on that exactly

1018
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
I think they do

1019
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
So I

1020
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:23,071
I do voice on Alex's show of at least some kind of

1021
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
Service

1022
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
Towards what

1023
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Protester about

1024
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
Syrian girl is coming in with a little bit of that

1025
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
I think

1026
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
A little

1027
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,663
And I think it might be in service of the wrong

1028
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
But superficially it has at least some

1029
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Like

1030
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
Appearances of

1031
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,879
Something close to rationality dealing with

1032
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,743
But I mean

1033
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
You can't allow that

1034
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,607
Because if you actually talk about the problem

1035
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
So I'm surprised that she has good but

1036
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
A window or some

1037
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
Get the f*** out of here

1038
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,223
So Alex is trying to also interview rationalize the police shooting people

1039
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,111
Glad

1040
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
It's just

1041
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,231
Streaming to shooting sticks

1042
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
And it's just

1043
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:30,399
Shooting save cops lives

1044
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
What do you expect

1045
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
The world

1046
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
Perfect

1047
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Absolutely

1048
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Man

1049
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Time does anybody

1050
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Just like

1051
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,343
Think of a solution

1052
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,951
Maybe we should also find a way to keep cops from getting shot at as much

1053
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,791
Like the problem is cops are getting shot at

1054
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
The answer is like

1055
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,679
We have zero creativity Society zero creativity

1056
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Maybe there's a different way other than let's have cops shoot people

1057
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,479
Alex Jones say like yes

1058
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Because the world's not perfect

1059
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
B2B say

1060
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,135
About would never be his position

1061
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Prior

1062
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,183
So

1063
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,463
I mean

1064
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,047
Reposition

1065
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,607
Been a little wild episode since we've heard something like this

1066
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,823
Force.com he orders in now plus uni Portal 2

1067
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,407
Over and over and over again throughout the episode just

1068
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
Hammering at home

1069
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:51,551
September 3rd August 6th

1070
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
Top of the month bills

1071
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,623
I don't know I don't know

1072
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,903
I don't know what it is

1073
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,743
I can't pretend to understand exactly what it is but there's

1074
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,303
Like the whole game that I was going to try and play

1075
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
Beginning of episode is B

1076
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:08,191
Like in denial of making everything up

1077
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,007
If you look at their somehow extended

1078
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,287
It is on this episode

1079
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,687
There's something nothing is real something requires money he said he needs a lot of money

1080
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:24,575
Probably a lump-sum maybe a lawyer's fee or something whatever it is it something

1081
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,903
Like I can't pretend

1082
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,951
Manifesting this

1083
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,255
I don't believe you would act like this if you just like

1084
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:37,375
I don't want to get a second car I'm going to f*** with people

1085
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
In this kind of way

1086
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,471
In order just to get a little bit of fun money

1087
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:46,847
Yeah your money for the possibility

1088
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
Because it's so psychopathic

1089
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,455
But now that I know it's a possibility

1090
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,759
He might want another car

1091
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,367
It seems unlikely

1092
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:04,511
Syrian girl is gone

1093
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
Have you can't go anywhere else

1094
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,919
And actually speak the truth without getting censored or banned

1095
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,527
I dare you to make shadowgate

1096
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
Speaking the truth

1097
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Doodles

1098
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:51,359
Can speak the truth and I believe in you and so I will continue to speak you in on things on the show I'm sure that I will be allowed

1099
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
How to speak the

1100
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Probably not

1101
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
Probably get your 6 month contract in the contract and you never worked at the begin with

1102
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,135
Send an email to Millie or a

1103
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
You don't even Twitter

1104
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,743
DM like a what's it like to work for Alex Jones

1105
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767
Nope nope

1106
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:17,471
Hey you know I can come in and say whatever I want speak

1107
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,823
What is the kind of Truth you want to say beautiful before and then

1108
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,383
Feminism happened Martian sir

1109
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,991
Really it's a cancer I mean look at what it does it infect

1110
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:33,343
Text all these women and it has them disown their greatest power which is their femininity

1111
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:43,327
Is boring-ass online talking points from the other Proto alright gamergate nonsense from

1112
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:49,727
Be angry at the other stuff to do. I feel like the right wing

1113
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,519
I mean obviously there's always

1114
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,567
Amongst

1115
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:06,111
In terms of like when that was really their Central like a big thing they put

1116
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,463
That was like when Milo yiannopoulos and Sargon of akkad we're kind of like

1117
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Who are these

1118
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,887
New faces feel like she's a little bit late on this anti-feminism Kik

1119
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,471
It's a little stale it's a little bit

1120
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Disney movie

1121
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:29,919
The needle probably what is it with these women burning their bras 50 years ago right

1122
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Good luck

1123
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,551
You're probably going to get fired

1124
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Really get a good lawyer

1125
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,583
Get a good lawyer Barnes

1126
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,447
Yeah even doesn't work anymore

1127
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Alex said bring about

1128
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
From time to time

1129
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,383
This is this is our look at September 3rd

1130
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
He needs money

1131
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,831
I mean I want to take a look

1132
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,135
What was going on in the present day

1133
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,463
But I also wanted to skip a couple days and get us
