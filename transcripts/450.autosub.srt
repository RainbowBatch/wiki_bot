Knowledge party.com

I have great respect but knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
About Alex

4
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan Jordan

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
What up

6
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Another nice piece of mail and Marcus Center

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
Copy of the Illuminati board game

8
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,600
New world order one

9
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Is a

10
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,000
Collectible weird pictures of Alex Jones

11
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
And Alex

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Predict the future

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
Nice little

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
You guys are the bright spots

15
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
2020

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,824
I'm down in this is one thank you so much

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Annabel Lee

18
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,992
We got to try and play that

19
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Like now

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
But the reason that I'm kind of resistant cuz I think I need to get another camera cuz I think I need

21
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Three camera shoot

22
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
The cards are being played

23
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,056
I feel like you do

24
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Corso

25
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Another camera cuz

26
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
30 bucks

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
I think

28
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
I might be low-balling.

29
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Starbucks

30
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
We'll figure that out in the future

31
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,096
What's my bright spot a game night or something

32
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,704
Very cool

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
The bright spot for me of course

34
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Is there

35
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
I will never read the Atlantic

36
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
It's garbage

37
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
All done

38
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
So many times

39
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
It's not friedersdorf

40
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Okay

41
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
Sentences through a an opinion piece written by two law professors about William

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
And the first sentence was a lot of people breathe a sigh of relief when

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
Bill Barr was appointed attorney general

44
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
And then the second sentence was everybody had High Hopes because

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,968
He had previously worked for an honorable Administration

46
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
This is trash

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm done with the Atlantic forever

48
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,208
You're like me and Project Camelot I don't believe at all

49
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
You'll be back

50
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
One day

51
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
A month after that we'll have another conversation or you say

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
I'm looking forward to a time where I need something

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Thing to get angry

54
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
I know that you can get angry just about anything

55
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,880
Specific sort of anger that friedersdorf you out of that drug

56
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,024
It really is it's the same button for you

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
I think part of it is responded to your tweet I think I think part of it is a purse

58
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,287
Personalization shoot him in the face with some mean words

59
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,407
That means that I'm there forever

60
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,159
26 2020 Zone

61
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
Bill Cooper episode for today cuz it's Monday

62
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
But

63
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
I might be done with that old assholes

64
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
A coverage of Oklahoma City

65
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,063
Immediately

66
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,023
The stuff that's actually interesting it might take me a lot longer

67
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Material

68
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,423
Tough for me to motivate myself to put hours and hours into that because

69
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
You don't want

70
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Listeners email

71
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Report

72
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Game

73
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
And that you would have liked

74
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Actual things to dig

75
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
And I think I think you know

76
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
Is that first episode that we covered it was about the

77
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
The fake document we can discuss that

78
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
I can't do anything with like someone from Oklahoma

79
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
It's really pathetic honestly and I'm disappointed

80
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Amore

81
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
Like get into his

82
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Actual

83
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Conspiracy career

84
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
There is now just like

85
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
I don't understand how people

86
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
I don't know why

87
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
I guess he is some sort of charisma

88
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
I'll get back to you

89
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
It's not feasible to do an episode every week

90
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
So whenever we're able to get back to it

91
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
But for now we are sticking to the present day with Alex Jones

92
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
Interesting

93
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
I guess

94
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Locked up

95
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
What kind Alex does a couple of particular things that are just like

96
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Continuing this trend towards like

97
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,143
I need political violence

98
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Does Heroes

99
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
So we can all kind of enjoyed

100
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
I'll before we get down to business on the actual episode

101
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
According to

102
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,455
So first plague bucks for patreon

103
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,807
Playbox

The person who has Paradise

105
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
With

106
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Oh no

107
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,455
Already known

108
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Ajp

109
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
AJ

110
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Soros

111
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
I didn't work so recite

112
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
I'm a policy wonk

113
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
And Nikki

114
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
Nicki

115
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Business

116
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Heroin

117
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Large

118
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
Nikki

119
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
Apologize

120
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:07,071
Bring it up every now and again

121
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Confused

122
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,239
Because we never reached

123
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Expected people to donate and it's

124
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,359
Dump shows down

125
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,223
It's just too late now renege on the offer of giving everyone shoutout

126
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
It's been more than two months and you haven't heard your shout out to email us and we will

127
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
I'll get you in the mix

128
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Everything episode

129
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
Today Show

130
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,215
About that mean

131
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
Coldplay song

132
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,895
The Fallopian tubes and tires

133
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,247
Possibly

134
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Alex

135
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
He's continuing his Crusade against mask

136
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
Which of course is all kind of beat-up to protest

137
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Protest

138
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,887
Kind of a running about everything

139
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Thumbs up

140
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,519
But now there's a big video that's gone viral with someone important. Com

141
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Where is

142
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,919
Dangerous levels of CO2

143
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Bought one yesterday

144
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Scientific

145
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Example

146
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
This is vacation killing people

147
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
What are we stopping

148
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Here are those reports back to back

149
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
Has found himself another viral video where somebody's mad about

150
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
So course he's decided this is

151
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
The scientific study

152
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
The video of the guy using a CO2 meter levels of CO2 or in his mask in like 5 Seconds

153
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Start beeping

154
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Indicating a dangerous concentration

155
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
CO2 in the area

156
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,967
Climate change for your face if this were accurate surgeon could never

157
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Perform surgery

158
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,135
Scientists and researchers could never be in a lab setting for more than a couple seconds without being a

159
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
Exposed to supposedly dangerous levels of CO2

160
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,791
There's a lot of people who wear masks for work like for entire shift

161
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Struction workers

162
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,191
Like I said nurses doctors surgeons dentist

163
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
I've seen the greatest Minds

164
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
My Generation Suffolk

165
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Okay from wearing a

166
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,151
Right that's dangerous effect on their oxygen or CO2

167
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
Breathing is really important

168
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
The weather

169
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
I understand

170
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
That's one of the factors

171
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
And then consider things like ski mask

172
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Pastor helmets that you wear for extended motorcycle ride

173
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,703
There are 100 examples of essentially impossible wearing a mask dangerously elevator CO2

174
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Or affect your breathing in a meeting for what

175
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Bulshit

176
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
N95 mask for Center.

177
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
People aren't doctors or nurses

178
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,759
Have to deal with and there are specialized Maps

179
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
That's a help mitigate those issue

180
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,647
I'll have thought of this

181
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
A long time before you did

182
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
Wants to touch back on the NASCAR story

183
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Spending a little bit for no reason

184
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
And then you get somebody

185
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
NASCAR

186
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Bubba Wallace

187
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Got caught with an H knowing that all those garage doors had those pulled out that they weren't nooses

188
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
One of them was

189
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Been there for years

190
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
His name in the Google this morning and I saw

191
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Hundreds of headlines

192
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Praising him and

193
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Praising NASCAR

194
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
This is a real threat

195
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
And that he's right

196
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Probably still a noose

197
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
So Alex is reporting a factually inaccurate version of the story because he's by his crimes

198
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Directed at people are a hoax

199
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
It's very well maybe this wasn't a crime

200
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Is not to be

201
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,255
Concrete fabrication

202
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
With his own narrative

203
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
The first is that all of the garages at the same found rope

204
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
This is specifically refuted by recording on the story that reflects

205
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
The guy who first reported the news check the other garage

206
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
To make sure it wasn't something

207
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Misrepresented or misunderstood

208
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Making this up but it was in all the garages

209
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
The second thing is Bubba and NASCAR Heroes

210
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
What we've been through this kind of business

211
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Being a hate crime

212
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
Both parties did act in ways that are commended

213
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447
What was that the courage to defend the guy at his garage who founded in sand humility

214
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
About what would have been there for over a year

215
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
Similarly NASCAR should be applauded for taking this seriously

216
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,455
And working to make sure that their drivers are able to work in a safe environment

217
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
Is this what happened in the WWE I guarantee they would have covered it up

218
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
The third thing is the people are saying that this is a noose

219
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207
Here is that people are definitely

220
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Play still saying that

221
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
And they're right

222
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
I've looked at it

223
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
What's the news

224
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
You bet

225
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,727
People are out of line

226
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
Look at the pictures

227
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
Clue

228
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Patterns

229
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Because otherwise

230
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
It's not really usable for his reporting

231
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Yeah it's

232
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Can you imagine

233
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
Acted like Alex Jones

234
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Do you still just like

235
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
Nope I know who was it was all white

236
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,039
People they all got together in billions and they just sat down

237
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Like that would be

238
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:28,255
Skip ahead a little bit more on that story

239
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,119
From Germany foster children

240
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Incase

241
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
Looking back on it

242
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
Embellish and anyway that's relevant

243
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
It probably would

244
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
Just be stupid to talk about

245
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Yeah

246
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
In Houston

247
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Takes off all the time

248
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
Anyway

249
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
She won't do

250
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Did she

251
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
I don't know

252
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Okay well that's

253
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,655
So we get to this next clip here and Alex's talking about

254
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
You know

255
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Yeah God right

256
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
By the devil

257
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Do something similar

258
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Alex's Hattie's

259
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
His fair share

260
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
Of instances of globalist

261
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Hot tubs

262
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
Square sometimes in airplanes

263
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
Sometimes calling him on his radio show

264
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Mysteriously not recording

265
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Hollywood

266
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Alex's at pretty-much

267
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,727
Every has contacted Alex

268
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
And try to reach

269
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
Fruit him to the team set for 1

270
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,151
Social media

271
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,015
Did Mark Zuckerberg tried to get me through this intermediaries to go up to New York

272
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Football

273
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Because he's in the face

274
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Almighty

275
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Here's what Alex

276
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Sympathetic

277
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Anybody

278
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,143
Would have recorded those cost

279
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,727
If I'm in a situation where I live

280
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,871
Easiest thing to record a call on Facebook

281
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,247
The first call maybe you don't record it you didn't grab this right

282
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
The second call

283
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
You got a

284
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Corded

285
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
These days with like smartphone

286
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
It's really easy to have like an app you can just press press the button

287
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Indication of

288
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Orge

289
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Just incompetent

290
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
It's because Alex has sort of pretending that there's like a grand conspiracy of

291
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Extortion

292
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Make you have 5 million

293
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
Talk bad about Tucker

294
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
If you have those recordings is actually

295
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
You have proof

296
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,975
Maybe that's why James O'Keefe only ever make shity videos

297
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
Because whenever he gets the good stuff he always forgets to press record on a

298
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Phone

299
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
That's always there that's always

300
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
Situation so that he has to make up some bulshit but if you just press record

301
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
I would have to assume that is what's going on

302
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
Is there popping out now the numbers are going up

303
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Nope nope

304
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
Alex's take on this is largely that it's just

305
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Because there's more

306
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Accurate but he's misleading

307
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Think about it

308
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Or not Rising

309
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Everywhere

310
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
When I cough

311
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,903
You don't have any family with a give you some medicine to make you relax and then

312
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,071
Derivative

313
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
But not before they suck hundreds of thousands of dollars out

314
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
City Hospital

315
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Real good

316
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
Start Rising

317
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Fairly accurate

318
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
But

319
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
Information

320
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
For two reasons

321
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
The first was that even if

322
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,863
Things were trending in the right direction

323
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
19

324
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
That's still not good

325
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
On March 20th of this year we cross

326
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
Started to be over 5,000 new cases identified per day

327
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,711
On that day there were only 70 deaths from covid-19

328
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Reported

329
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
On March 31st

330
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
The numbers jump

331
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
2 / 1,000

332
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Isn't the day

333
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,927
This is because dafler what they call a lagging indicator of virus

334
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
That's almost never going to be the first sign you get a butt

335
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Disease spread

336
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Particularly

337
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,119
Rocori virus like this which doesn't kill people immediately

338
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,727
It's pretty impossible to tell what's going to be the case in about a week or two but

339
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
Terrible we do not really know at this point

340
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,871
Weather in Decatur is going

341
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Spike in the way that

342
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
It did the first time around

343
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,063
And here you have Alex doing everything in his power to make sure that things go worse

344
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,672
Not only on Sunday where Master explicitly discourage

345
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
He's telling his audience to avoid going to the hospital if they're sick

346
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
Because the doctors

347
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,168
If I believe such a thing were possible I would suggest that Alex is being paid by covid

348
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
He's doing all the things that are most likely to facilitate spreading the virus

349
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
It's like trying to start a national movement against

350
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Mask-wearing

351
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
In attempting to bring a large group

352
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Two people together

353
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,272
He's working overtime to demonize anyone who takes a virus seriously like dr. fauci

354
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
The entire CDC

355
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
He's building a library

356
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Conspiracy theories to convince

357
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Sick themselves

358
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
Would you increase the likelihood that they'll have a more severe case

359
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
We're spread it to others

360
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
The real world function of how his show is

361
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
If you were

362
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
If you really look down

363
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,336
If there was a shadow organization of global

364
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
With the ex

365
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
Licit intent of trying to call the population

366
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
No one could be

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Be doing a better job for them than

368
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,136
Yeah I mean

369
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
It doesn't exist

370
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
Imaginary World War 1

371
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,048
He's doing

372
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
More illness

373
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Exactly

374
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Alex believes that the only

375
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
Thing that's going to work

376
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Is for Trump

377
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
To take out design

378
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Sure

379
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
But there's a problem

380
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,248
Is running a marxist-leninist co-op play

381
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Every financial publications

382
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Give me the dollar

383
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,952
We are being taken down it's so Criminal

384
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Want to be

385
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
Claire's was happening they arrest The Conspirator cuz it's a

386
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
What's a globalist

387
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
The country so undermined and we're still used to appeasing that it prompted that

388
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
Farsang the military's going to kill him

389
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
Did not say that was fighting on The Daily Show

390
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Just want to play golf today

391
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
China

392
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Retire off

393
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
They're not

394
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
Country

395
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
Wishing I'd done something but if matter

396
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Bread and created

397
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Okay

398
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
In the last 50 years

399
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
For this moment to bring

400
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
Country down the long-term plan

401
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Pink totally collapsed

402
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,024
The average left this is going to be a starving maggot mystery

403
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,448
I mean mister anti-police State Mister anti FEMA camps

404
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,032
Take solace that our enemies will be in Kent

405
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
The fuk down

406
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
Even further with it about needing to kill folks off

407
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Ecards

408
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
He doesn't have the people

409
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Doesn't have the military

410
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
Because America is rotten to the Core

411
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
So that's an unsettling

412
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
To hear from Alex

413
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
We would totally have a coup and we will be run by military dictatorship

414
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,848
The control over the military I don't know what's going on why wouldn't he have control over the military

415
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:53,248
Helicopter ride

416
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Corners of the internet

417
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,160
Use the method of throwing people out of planes and helicopters of the way of killing political dissenters

418
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,768
Term is most directly associated with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet

419
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
Hughes helicopters

420
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
They killed many of the people who posed

421
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,424
Threat to his regime and that's who you want the American president to be relayed

422
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
Alexina

423
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,336
In 2015 this started to become a meme on 410 and other unsavory places

424
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
Cuz we're posters

425
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
Pastor desire to kill their political opponent

426
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
By saying that they should go on a helicopter

427
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,832
Relax don't do this specifically because under his rule thousands of Chileans

428
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
Executed tortured and turned or disappeared

429
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
In a large number of them are what you would call leftist

430
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
Finish a rose to office after Roku

431
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Was backed by the United States

432
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
Anthony socialist government under President Salvador Allende

433
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
Pinochet would rule Chile 1990

434
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
Mostly left

435
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,456
No we're all just be a big pile of s*** in the same things happening in Bolivia

436
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
That was all bulshit

437
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
That was ran over around

438
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,624
Easiest right-wing is taking Pinochet on as a bit of a hero because of

439
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,768
He overthrew an elected left-wing government and then people who are not on board with

440
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
This is what people like Alex

441
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Want

442
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
These you the 26

443
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
16 election is being their version of pinochet's 19-7

444
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
33 military coup override

445
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
Frustration that Trump has enacted the same power

446
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
You can see this all over the

447
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,504
Advances demonstrations you'll frequently see people with free helicopter rides shirt

448
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,576
Or the also popular Pinochet did nothing wrong

449
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
This is what Alex wants

450
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
He supports Trump because he wants to live in a right-wing dictatorship

451
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,536
Before anyone expressing left thrown out of

452
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
What's knocking helicopter

453
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
It's pretty much obvious to me all the time

454
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
He's just

455
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
This is really on this

456
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
I was like

457
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
Kill everyone

458
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
And he goes on like even ask

459
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
It's time to get into his weird Syfy

460
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
What are the Libertarians are run by the UN will run by China run by Hollywood run by the University

461
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
You don't need a big government

462
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,840
We need the government to execute the 45 We the People

463
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Who's Winnie-the-Pooh

464
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Dropped Execute Order 66

465
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
It's not going to happen because he doesn't exist

466
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes that is true that is true on a sexual base

467
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
Enon prequel fans out there

468
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
Order 66 was the order that the Sith

469
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Planted in the clothes

470
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
Do all Jedi is Traders in this subject

471
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Fusion

472
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Italy very bad guys

473
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
Goodguys Jedi talk about a revolution on his lead the count

474
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Savi Empire

475
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:04,480
You know a lot of people are like

476
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Iran's economy

477
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Of course exploding entire planet

478
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,648
That's worth killing Beyond like

479
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
Alex cannot be any clearer that you understand

480
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
He's on the evil side

481
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
What with rambling about Trump executing orders

482
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
B6 and wishing is imagined enemies will be giving helicopter rides

483
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,264
You pretty open about being you just doesn't care anymore

484
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
It is obvious

485
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
If you're listening to this show and you're into Alex

486
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,456
Whether you realize it or not

487
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Emperor Palpatine

488
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
While pretending that you're super into the Constitution

489
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
F******

490
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
Thirdly sad

491
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,816
Is in some ways a good sign that means they feel like they are really getting their ass

492
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
They feel like they're losing

493
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
Execute everyone I don't

494
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Because there's

495
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,664
But then that when that happens they tend to start executing people they don't like and then they winning

496
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
So we got to keep them from doing that part

497
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
And that is

498
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
If you ever

499
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't know what like

500
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
You been in a situation where like you really want it

501
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,400
My carrot and someone

502
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
Burger

503
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
I am going to go after that carrot

504
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
You stare at the character second you're like what

505
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,760
The fuk was that Carol levitating

506
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
Alex does a little bit of that

507
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
Just wait till after the election happen

508
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Autonomy

509
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Keep it locked

510
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
America the blame for the virus

511
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
Women lie about all the stuff

512
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
Because of their

513
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:04,288
Going to be destroyed if Trump wins again because they're all going to go to prison

514
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,408
But there's a problem they're going to purge

515
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Don't use your adventure

516
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Our war

517
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Physical War

518
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
Lock her up thing the first time around back in 20

519
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:34,240
16

520
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Can you put Hillary in prison

521
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
But now four years later Hillary is

522
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
Nor any of the other folks who Alex

523
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Contraband like

524
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
The yellow about Obama Susan Rice

525
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
Eric

526
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
People on the other hand

527
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
So great

528
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,256
His personal lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty to a bunch of crimes and agreed to cooperate

529
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,656
General Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI and would be going to jail if it weren't for the super corrupt Department of Justice

530
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Trump's former campaign manager

531
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
Was found guilty of

532
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,848
Do tax fraud four counts of fraud

533
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,016
19 concern really important

534
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
He be released from prison due to covid

535
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Not a lot of other

536
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,464
I think I'm going to support it still cuz I need to be hypocritical.

537
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
That sucks

538
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm not mad about him

539
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
United States

540
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
45 days in a year probation

541
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:48,992
Rodger stone is probably going to be in prison within about two weeks unless Trump so you will not

542
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
Set this on our show

543
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
I would love to see

544
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
If this word

545
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Not reality

546
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
I would love to

547
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,096
To see Trump humble Rodger by

548
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
A little bit

549
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
This is reality

550
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,776
I'm concerned the last-minute pardon

551
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
But I also think like

552
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
What's going on nobody's going to be held accountable

553
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
Why can't why can't you self the headache

554
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
Did I don't know

555
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
Suspect you would have done it right

556
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
Whatever

557
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Cute sorters

558
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
66 upon his re-election

559
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,336
The only people who are going to end up jail or more people who

560
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
He's friends with

561
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Sexy

562
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Tubi

563
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
Fiat planet

564
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
We had a

565
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
Department of Justice

566
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Real

567
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
The chance

568
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
Conventions coming up

569
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Lee virtual convention

570
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Which is probably for the latest

571
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
Decision

572
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,776
Not afraid of the globe

573
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Virtual convention

574
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
Virtual convention so they can

575
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
By the taquitos

576
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,232
Put into that really planning

577
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
President

578
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,584
Repeat

579
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
Because I'm a race

580
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
The filing deadlines are long past

581
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Is Hillary and Obama wanted to run on a third ticket or like an independent actually still have the time to get the signatures

582
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
Stay balanced

583
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Tampa Bay

584
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,792
And it's weirdo fantasy scenario where they're running they will be on the Democratic ticket and that

585
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Like I wouldn't have any belt

586
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
No

587
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:18,752
There isn't a clear winner of the state's primaries

588
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,592
And that's not going to be the case this year already

589
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,944
2171 delegates of the 1990s

590
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,296
Denomination

591
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
Bernie was the only other candidate

592
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
All of the candidate

593
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
The weirdos on the right love

594
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Tulsi gabbard

595
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Have all endorsed Biden

596
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
The convention

597
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,472
Virtual

598
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,080
I know Alex obsessed with the idea of Hillary

599
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
The coast on anti-hillary

600
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Sentimental

601
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Fundraise office

602
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
But I don't really see your way that's going to happen

603
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,648
I don't know my prediction is still however that

604
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Martin Luther King

605
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
King junior's granddaughter will be

606
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
This year

607
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,632
That's my prediction Trump time traveler

608
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,032
It was like

609
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
2020

610
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,920
Alright I'm excited

611
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
I'm looking forward to it

612
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
The murderers

613
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Tony fauci

614
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
CIA

615
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,176
Why they've got a hit team tell me

616
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
Kill me

617
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,368
Shut up so you can murder old people

618
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,512
Homeless people killing baby

619
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Spiritually blind

620
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,320
Sun coming High Noon coming to know what happens to people

621
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Will be destroyed

622
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
I was just listening to

623
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Add add

624
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
Add

625
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
You resisted so high

626
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Bananas

627
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Also

628
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
So weird

629
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,600
Warning Alex well ahead of time before

630
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
Child had a warning that the police are going to kill Emma now as an adult

631
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Assassinate

632
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,400
You don't warn people before you

633
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
This morning to gation

634
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
Lion

635
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
Videos going around on social media of

636
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
A woman at a city council meeting

637
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
In Florida

638
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,528
Yeah yeah the Parks and Rec

639
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:48,928
Compare the number of

640
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Alex

641
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Oh my God

642
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
This is amazing

643
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,680
Men and women in New York and Florida California

644
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
And they're staying

645
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
Infowars.com

646
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Were they

647
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
Are they scared buddy

648
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Google

649
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
I can't

650
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
God don't you worry.

651
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
So fake

652
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Just

653
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
So artificial

654
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Spheal

655
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
Like my Human Side almost does feel a certain level of

656
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,968
Because I'm imagining

657
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
Putting myself in that space where I have to watch somebody

658
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,368
Who is clearly unwell about

659
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Nonsense and be like

660
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
My job is

661
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Is to save that

662
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
Great sucks

663
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Yeah

664
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Yeah

665
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
It's a box

666
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
You put yourself in

667
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
You constantly remind people of his

668
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,832
This is a religious thing for Alex

669
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,416
Like all of this political stuff all these things

670
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,304
Tools like you said it explicitly on the show before

671
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
Jesus version

672
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
When you try to

673
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
Hard to describe you just have to say no

674
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
And trusting God but as a man

675
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Constantly feel like I'm

676
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
The peace of God

677
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
No you are

678
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
You cannot be

679
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Beautiful God

680
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
So I mean there's like 20 years on the radio I've been yelling about the political machinations of these

681
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Globalist store

682
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,600
The entire time I'm kind of

683
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Analytical

684
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
AP communist Joe

685
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Hats Burien

686
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,936
Course

687
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
He's the guy who run the website

688
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
Genocide

689
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
This is all about abortion

690
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,064
You know people aren't shotgun are all over the place this dude's got a very simple idea

691
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,416
He is also still shocked because there's so many different

692
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Things that I'll just

693
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Just ignore

694
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
Entire interview cuz I don't

695
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Particularly careful

696
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
He kept saying

697
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
I said there has to be something

698
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Extraordinary something else

699
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
Something that would really impact the election November 2nd January they realized

700
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,600
That indeed there was no way

701
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
I went beyond my expectations

702
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
I think they got

703
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
George Floyd

704
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,207
Very good very good what you got that went right straight home and it's no doubt about it

705
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
Every single every single thing is about stock price

706
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
November

707
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
I just have

708
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
Floyd with a gif

709
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,503
Trump

710
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
People live in where that's an okay

711
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
You know

712
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
Is it spelled

713
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
Is that is that how you described

714
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,303
So because it's only really in relation to how they feel about

715
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,399
No it's not likely election or the government even is real

716
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
Protesting

717
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
You know

718
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
Conversation now around

719
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,895
Various people who murdered

720
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
In the aftermath of that the

721
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
The conversation

722
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
What's happen

723
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
They don't have any feelings

724
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,927
Is there any point that reality doesn't exist outside

725
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
To love some

726
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
Evil cabal to defeat his

727
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Is hero

728
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
And that's weird

729
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,143
Well is it makes sense because for all of these people nothing

730
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
Is beyond a tool

731
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
The everything is a

732
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,823
Everything is there every news story is there to not react

733
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
2 with any kind of

734
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Reality but to

735
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Use as a cudgel against

736
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Your political opponents

737
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
There's something to that

738
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
The other team

739
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
Has to be doing the same thing as well

740
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:43,231
We're not on their team is because of what

741
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
They want to put us in camps

742
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,871
In-depth until on Antioch

743
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,431
They're being paid $300 a day

744
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
On the plane and stabbing

745
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,903
They always have a couple of cans missing out of the six pack

746
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,975
Inm

747
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,303
Arrested by the way

748
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Need to know that

749
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,887
People do need to know this

750
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
You got a boner

751
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:28,799
Alex's accosted by

752
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
We want to get them on

753
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
Reverend Childress has a friend who overheard

754
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,783
Didn't you see all the antifa

755
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,623
Going around Black Block planes

756
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,719
Do great paying extra if we get arrested

757
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
Oh my God

758
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:56,447
Don't f*** out of here massive conspiracy

759
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:01,823
I guess starting a race war

760
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,407
God there's nobody

761
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,807
Do they not get the message with me and come on what's going on

762
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
Alright

763
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,647
So Chris has another

764
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,231
About black lives matter

765
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Not very good

766
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
Black life matters website

767
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,751
Basically says they're against the West

768
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Family idea

769
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
How how they feel that that is a western

770
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,271
Ideology and not anything that would be conducive to the world

771
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,623
Is matter website there is a section titled what we believe

772
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,439
Following paragraph

773
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,047
We disrupt the western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement

774
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,119
By supporting each other as extended family

775
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
Collectively care for one another

776
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
Especially our children

777
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,775
To the degree that Mother's parents and children are comfortable

778
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,431
This is intentionally misrepresented by right-wing conmen to imply that they want to just

779
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Inclusion

780
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
And it approved

781
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
Community that issues the requirements

782
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
The people be nuclear family to be family

783
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:23,231
You know that old saying it takes a village to

784
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,815
Made That explicit

785
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
That represents thousands of years of human existence realizing that raising a child by yourself

786
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Tell me one other person

787
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Is not as

788
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,823
As successful as raising them as a community

789
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,199
Actually destroyed

790
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Dad

791
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah you notice

792
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
When every Church calls their congregation a family

793
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
Because we understand

794
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Concept perfectly well

795
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:58,303
Maliciously weaponizing fears about it in this case because it's part of the social

796
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
They feel threatened

797
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,191
People that'll do more than enough to get a plenty of people on your f****** side

798
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
It is next

799
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,799
Reverend Childress

800
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,615
Bringing up the legacy of Martin Luther King

801
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
In order to

802
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,711
Do you like life matter

803
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Profound profit

804
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,255
In this nation that brought about social change dr. Martin Luther King

805
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,815
1 Savage faded love

806
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,143
Nonviolent

807
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,263
Don Garlits assertively looting

808
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,335
Breaking a glass

809
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,151
Far be it for me to pretend that I fully understand.

810
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,711
Complete scope of the legacy of Martin Luther King jr.

811
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
The Reverend Childress

812
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,135
The 110 King's most famous quote a riot is the language of the

813
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
John heard

814
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,255
Expanded on this point in the speech given in 1967 at Stanford

815
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
In a real sense our nation

816
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,887
Summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay

817
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,959
And as long as the America postpones just

818
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
We stand at the position

819
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,079
I'm having these recurrences of violence and right over and over again

820
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,407
Social justice and progress of the absolute guarantee

821
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
The riot prevent

822
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
Martin Luther King was a proponent of nonviolent resistance

823
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,855
But he was also pretty clear that right

824
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
Not getting anywhere

825
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,439
That's the whole unheard part of the equation

826
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,815
Misconception which I agree with for the most part for no reason

827
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,399
People who feel they have access to non-violent means to effect

828
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,191
Do not write it as their first stop

829
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Generally speaking I don't know

830
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
I don't know if I can think of it exactly

831
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
We have spent

832
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
So much

833
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Next time.

834
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:55,807
King even denounced the people who save it black folks riding only leads to anger

835
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,903
Black power and riots

836
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
The Harlem's in the other areas

837
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
Are the consequence

838
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Backlash

839
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Rather than the cause of the

840
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,935
By the end of 1967 there were strong indications that can't get changed his mind and embraced Mariah

841
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
It doesn't matter protest

842
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
He gave a speech at the America

843
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Psychology Association Convention

844
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Included the following

845
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:22,687
Urban riots must now be recognized as durable

846
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
They may be deplored

847
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
Should be understood

848
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
Urban Riot sorry special form of Iowa

849
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,463
The writers are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control event

850
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Institutions

851
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
Community

852
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Distorted form of social

853
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
The protest

854
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
Eluding which is the prince

855
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
Teacher serves many function

856
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,751
It enables the most enraged and deprived negro

857
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,287
Consumer goods

858
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
He's the white man does

859
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
By using his purse

860
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,943
I was reading a piece that in timeline

861
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
Abdurraqib

862
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,575
The matter of Martin Luther King's stance on violence

863
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
Particularly in the context of how Alex

864
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Try to use

865
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Quote

866
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
Beyond The Mists attributed quotes and bad memes in poor logic

867
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:14,655
Maiden his name the real tragedy

868
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,215
Do so with a fundamental perversion of his message

869
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,359
Non-violence as it is discussed in fetishize in proximity to the poor and or the marginalized

870
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,151
It's so often dragged out

871
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,711
In response to any uprising

872
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
The riot is the language yes

873
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
But the response to the riot is also

874
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
The language

875
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
Nicole is for peace and love but

876
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,255
True demand is for complete silence all together

877
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,095
NFL player takes money without speaking and is threatened in Haiti

878
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
Call the violent Thug in a racist

879
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,239
Colors no protest can be peaceful enough

880
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:55,615
If somebody hadn't murdered Martin Luther King and he was still alive today I have a hunch that he would be on

881
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Inside the protest

882
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
West Point I want to make

883
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,575
Because Martin Luther King

884
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
That in no way means that everyone has

885
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,159
Have to do that in order to be

886
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
The protesters

887
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
You can absolutely hate the people your protest

888
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
You're just as valid in your act

889
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
Anybody else

890
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
This all boils down to

891
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Distorting is Martin Luther King

892
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,935
Respective

893
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
People like Alex do to invalidate any protein

894
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
They don't lie

895
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
Well I mean

896
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,663
The cereal to mately is

897
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
Nonviolent protest

898
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
Is the non-violence

899
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,271
Are the ones you want

900
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Table

901
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
In the

902
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
The violent protesters are how you get them

903
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
That's the reality

904
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:45,023
Because we've seen how many we see millions of women March

905
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
And not a goddamn thing

906
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
We've seen a few weeks of protests

907
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
With

908
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Property damage

909
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Holyshit

910
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,775
Another thing

911
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
I've been done

912
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:02,687
Look I don't want to should be negotiating our future

913
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,479
Diversity of tactics

914
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
Can be an important element

915
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Protoss

916
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:14,463
But I think in terms of particularly when you talk about Martin Luther King and his stance on this stuff

917
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
A large part of it is

918
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
Isn't so much what you're saying

919
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
In terms of like we need somebody

920
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,935
To set up

921
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:29,055
His position was largely position was more like

922
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
What do you think of

923
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
This is this is

924
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Part of

925
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
What happened

926
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
When

927
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Things aren't

928
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,831
Done

929
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
The

930
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
You know

931
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
4 piece when there is

932
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,023
Cornell parties

933
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,631
Just

934
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,751
Peaceful protest

935
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,543
President

936
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
Individualism

937
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Distance is exist

938
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
Within a spectrum of things that have happened

939
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Pretend that there's

940
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Some sort of a

941
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,135
Unique or overriding

942
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Mobility for people who

943
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
Commit property damage

944
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Get off the hook

945
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
All of the people who had

946
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,703
The winters of inaction that led to that summer of Acts

947
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
The understanding

948
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
From people like Alex

949
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
The Reverend children

950
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Play come on

951
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:41,247
And try and Martin Luther King's name

952
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
The protest

953
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
Disgusting

954
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
Mainly because

955
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,927
They are using Martin Luther King jr.

956
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
To say

957
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Get back in your pee

958
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,327
Orpheus settle down

959
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Rate

960
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Be quiet

961
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
Waetford

962
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
That'll work

963
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,591
It'll work this time I know it's America

964
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
Letter from a Birmingham Jail

965
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
For another day

966
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,087
So prize matter apparel

967
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
I would want to touch on here then

968
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:26,047
A specifically contoured made up to the region the country that you are in

969
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:32,191
Audiology major draw you out

970
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,055
Hey because this nation is always battle with race what do you think he would come

971
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,615
But with black lives matters

972
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,175
The after

973
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,247
He wants to change the definition of family

974
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
Husband

975
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,815
Control everyone

976
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,423
Absolutely but is a devil is making it up so it's going to be good

977
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,287
How many left

978
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Countries

979
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,151
Does the CIA need to topple before we just consider them not

980
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
The left

981
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
CIA

982
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
I don't know

983
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,271
Alex

984
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,831
The left-right CIA

985
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,415
Really the devil created

986
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
Back to a board

987
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,887
Childress

988
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
Planned Parenthood

989
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,543
Races of her time

990
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
Adolf Hitler

991
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Right

992
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,175
We happened to is it

993
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
Is it

994
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
They don't want to see you

995
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:54,623
Just the stress that everything is due to the bad boils down to anti-abortion

996
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,279
Either one issue Gaston Alex's only existence

997
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
Bounce can't really be racist because the real

998
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,143
Sister people who support reproductive right

999
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,703
Did not like Margaret

1000
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
In fact her work was burned

1001
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
The Purge of 1933

1002
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,847
Along with the writings of Freud in Magnus hirschfeld

1003
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,431
One of the reasons that the Nazis hated her is because her main work

1004
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
Even if they want to say now everything's about abortion

1005
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,575
Remain work with about birth control and family planning

1006
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,623
Which ran counter to the goals of the Third Reich

1007
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
Which was to create as many Aryan children as possible

1008
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
If not see women work

1009
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
Fall under the sway of these radical theories about birth control and self

1010
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Determination

1011
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,143
The plan would be harder to pursue

1012
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,703
Similarly Sanger hated Hitler

1013
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
It was a member of the America

1014
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
Council against Nazi propaganda

1015
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,615
Germany

1016
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,431
Singer was a proponent of some ideas

1017
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,015
That is definitely true

1018
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,831
I do not try to pretend that's not the case

1019
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,903
To work my way to peace

1020
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,719
She's explicit that any definition of quote

1021
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Could not be based on race or religion

1022
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
Still reviews

1023
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,399
I think a little bit of

1024
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:16,799
Scratch

1025
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,199
Yeah yeah yeah like there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff

1026
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Is on Fortune

1027
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Stuff

1028
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
Does not

1029
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,903
This is a load of historical revisionism

1030
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:37,023
Just because I don't like it

1031
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,559
And have family planning

1032
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
Sanger was one of the

1033
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,263
Was beef most devout racist overtime

1034
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,335
Does he know who's around during her tongue

1035
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,967
Explaining

1036
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,783
You boarded like 1879

1037
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,415
Racist

1038
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
Outrageous

1039
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
Yeah let's never forget

1040
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,983
Just f****** dudes

1041
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
To some extent

1042
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
So

1043
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,735
Reverend Childress has

1044
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Skype problem

1045
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
And Alex

1046
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
Is devil

1047
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,695
He's trying to deal with

1048
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Announce

1049
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Average shoulders

1050
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
What's getting back on the next few weeks

1051
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,911
Pokemon once a year we on

1052
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Brushing crazy

1053
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Rasmussen poll

1054
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735
40% of African-Americans likely voters

1055
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
Say

1056
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,295
Donald Trump

1057
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Am I interested or really take

1058
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,935
The only reason I clip is bond is because of the

1059
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Sky place

1060
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
And then also because Alex says that Reverend

1061
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
That interview won't go well

1062
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,479
You hate Trump because him

1063
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
Tribulation Trump

1064
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Oh my God

1065
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
If Manning comes back on

1066
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,487
I cannot wait for that episode

1067
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
It's going to go like

1068
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
2 minutes

1069
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
Going to hang up on me

1070
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,167
Trump is intentionally bringing

1071
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,567
Sing about the end of the world

1072
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
Forgotten

1073
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,151
There's a reason he's not

1074
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,527
The end of this episode here on the 25th

1075
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,087
And he makes it clear

1076
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,903
As he did earlier that God is the only way forward

1077
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Sure

1078
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
U-god

1079
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Knock knock

1080
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
The other guy

1081
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
You all know it I'm sorry for people

1082
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Or whatever

1083
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Osher

1084
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
No atheists in foxholes

1085
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
Other religions you got steered wrong when you were a kid

1086
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,647
Yeah I feel like

1087
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,695
Pretty high tolerance

1088
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
For people who like preach

1089
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
Transcendence

1090
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,583
Transcendental Meditation

1091
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,679
You like the idea of what do you have wrong with David Lynch

1092
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
I don't want to get into it

1093
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:02,335
I don't have a problem with people who are like really big

1094
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
Recognizing

1095
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
Things outside yourself religion

1096
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,575
Christianity Judaism Islam

1097
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Shintoism

1098
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,951
Connection with something large

1099
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:23,583
Histamines

1100
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,887
That's all you yeah I mean

1101
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Sure yeah

1102
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,983
I don't have a problem

1103
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
People who are like

1104
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,359
One of the most important things for us moving forward is recognizing

1105
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,943
You know this Transcendent ability that we all have within us

1106
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:45,343
I think there's a really easy way to it be an entry point to a scam

1107
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,927
Self is that toxic but once you start getting into

1108
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,535
You only my version of transcendence is real the Restoril I

1109
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
That's when it's

1110
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
It's like a man

1111
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
This is

1112
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
You're doing culture

1113
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
It's really ugly

1114
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,239
We get into the 20

1115
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,055
And you're a familiar refrain

1116
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,943
But this one is going to be particularly over the top

1117
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
Everything I'm going to be covering is Mega bombs

1118
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:19,903
Mega bombshell Salon stop your car open your window get other

1119
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
Other people know this is just a really important

1120
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,255
We didn't stop traffic

1121
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,607
So

1122
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
And Deborah

1123
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,007
On the NIH website

1124
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
Rochelle you this coming up

1125
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
Mitch

1126
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,151
That the mask

1127
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Does not

1128
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,479
Keep you from breathing

1129
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
Viruses are bad

1130
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,951
Live longer than they would

1131
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
Allowing it to the NBA spread

1132
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
Which is why we won the reason

1133
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,095
Diagnosed

1134
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
But there

1135
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,935
Keep people indoors and they're wearing the mask

1136
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
That are

1137
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Weapon system

1138
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
Totally unfiltered

1139
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
In the fabric

1140
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Urban Air

1141
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Erlanger

1142
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,415
There's a few very basic problems with what Alex is saying

1143
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,255
DC DC and different organizations

1144
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,303
Has the same thing

1145
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:34,911
They're both part of the Department of Health and Human Services

1146
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,239
The CDC is focused on response control and prevention

1147
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,287
As it relates to public health issues

1148
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,847
Where is the NIH is primarily a research

1149
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Institution

1150
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,783
These groups can work hand-in-hand and they complement each other but Alex

1151
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Birthday which is just dumb

1152
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Also fun fact

1153
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,671
CDC head for the entirety

1154
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Is two terms

1155
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:00,255
So far in just one term Trump has appointed

1156
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
Four different people to leave that group

1157
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,863
Not good

1158
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
Not good cuz they all nailed

1159
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,239
Two there's no article about this on Infowars website

1160
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,103
There's one article titled Michelle

1161
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,943
Face Max Max proven

1162
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,039
But that's just a page that has an embedded video of this episode of his show

1163
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,087
Is 0 information orally

1164
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Thanks for Everything to learn more

1165
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
Justin Trudeau

1166
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
0

1167
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,815
If this were the case that somehow wearing masks were a brief time with detrimental to your health

1168
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
Doctors nurse

1169
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,167
Dentist Nasser to help professionals will be dropping like flies

1170
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:44,543
When Alex brings up the specifics later I'll get into it but when I was listening to

1171
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Wild goose

1172
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
Chase on the CDC and NIH has website

1173
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Whatever he's lying about

1174
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
I'll also

1175
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
That totally unrelated

1176
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,319
Reported on the case of

1177
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,879
Delete organizer of reopen Maryland

1178
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,439
Who was an aggressive campaigner against

1179
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,535
Turns out he tested positive for covid-19 after developing vision

1180
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,815
Problems a headache

1181
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
And a fever

1182
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:13,727
Suggested he has recently come into contact with

1183
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,823
However he's refusing to cooperate with Maryland contact tracers by provider

1184
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,639
Contain the virus

1185
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,735
She doesn't blame basic science for his getting sick

1186
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:30,879
You've decided that seat from covid-19

1187
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Before getting sick which

1188
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
Is really cool thank you

1189
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,279
What

1190
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
That's

1191
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,935
In public without a mask

1192
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,007
For testing positive

1193
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,055
Infection

1194
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
He may not have a chance to do that because

1195
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,455
Three-year-old said

1196
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,247
While admitting he does not mean to

1197
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,063
Maintain healthy habits

1198
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,719
Obviously this dude doesn't represent everyone on his side of things represent at least some percentages

1199
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
People who

1200
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
Cannot understand

1201
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
It's because

1202
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Does the thing

1203
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Most likely

1204
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Yeah this is

1205
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,847
This is literally

1206
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Like

1207
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,687
Cambrian levels

1208
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:31,551
Newsies from history

1209
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:36,671
Like this is obviously the lightning struck two days ago which is why I have

1210
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Covid-19

1211
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
Everyone around him

1212
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
My caring for someone else

1213
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
No he should be

1214
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,799
Kept inside of his home under house arrest

1215
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,175
That's the only reason we know about that story is because it

1216
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,991
It's newsworthy because he ran one of these protests

1217
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
I don't know

1218
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
What is the numbers

1219
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
The people who

1220
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Who knows

1221
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,791
Where is Joe Biden

1222
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,631
20 million people died in the US

1223
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,703
40% of the US population.

1224
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:24,287
That is not true it's 110,000 and almost

1225
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,823
Here's the Peruvian

1226
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:31,711
Drastically underestimate is the impact on Mental Health

1227
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,271
People who now everything's complicated

1228
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,831
Not only is the health-care peace but

1229
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,159
People don't have a job people don't have anywhere to go

1230
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
They don't know what they're going to do

1231
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,743
People you have

1232
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,583
Unnecessarily now we have over 120 million dead

1233
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
From covid

1234
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
400

1235
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
I mean

1236
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,519
What is a contact

1237
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
What was going to say

1238
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:02,943
Such classic Alex man

1239
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
Got that part off

1240
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,271
Like it's so clear if you listening

1241
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,831
Immediately corrected himself cuz he misspoke

1242
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
Now we have over 120 million dead from covid

1243
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
I mean 120,000 detrapel

1244
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
This is just fake outrage

1245
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,447
That message

1246
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Across the public

1247
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
You just misspoke

1248
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,847
That's the full context it doesn't get more wacky

1249
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,639
Alex is just a fraud and a liar

1250
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Can't believe

1251
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
That his

1252
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,479
Super competent

1253
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
Would it cut that clip

1254
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,831
The part where he says I mean

1255
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,647
Yeah because everybody is already assumed what he's going to

1256
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,463
To say next

1257
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
I found

1258
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,303
That they on YouTube.

1259
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
Alex sees people

1260
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,639
Terrible I really

1261
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
More

1262
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
There is so much to breakdown

1263
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
So much to cover today

1264
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
For everybody

1265
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Because it's so incredibly

1266
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
Important

1267
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
Do you understand

1268
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
CDC

1269
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Dot-gov

1270
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
Shotgun

1271
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
The disease

1272
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Page four

1273
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
Page 4 of the website

1274
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,071
Picture of the website

1275
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,911
According to what

1276
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:03,775
Page for the cdc's website website

1277
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
Are you my grandma

1278
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
Cdc.gov

1279
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
Backslash

1280
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Page four

1281
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Right

1282
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,735
First thing here

1283
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
He's talking about

1284
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,599
Because page for a website isn't

1285
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,927
N95 mask do not the same thing as the face mask

1286
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
About you

1287
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:28,863
Even so everything I can find on the cdc's website says that they have a general filter

1288
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,655
Efficacy of 95%

1289
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,007
All the cdc's page titled recommendation regarding the use of

1290
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Cloth face covering

1291
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,359
The facemasks are recommended to slow the

1292
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Spread of the virus

1293
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
And that you should not be using n95 mask

1294
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,223
But not because they don't work

1295
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Quotes

1296
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,063
Cloth mask covering recommended or not surgical mask

1297
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
Or n95 respirators

1298
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:54,975
Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other first

1299
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
America first

1300
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Responders

1301
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,839
Alex's team is big news but he's provided no one

1302
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
Navigation

1303
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
Information

1304
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
For the cdc's website

1305
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,471
Which is almost worse than him saying nothing

1306
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
More confusing

1307
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,799
Is Page 4

1308
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
To him

1309
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
What does he think page for of a website

1310
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
He has

1311
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
Sheets of paper that says

1312
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,039
Some intern printed out and it's on the fourth page

1313
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:24,415
Yeah

1314
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
From other than okay

1315
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,815
It's something on the cdc's website that one of his staff printed off

1316
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
Auntie fourth page of

1317
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Print out

1318
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
I got nothing this is stupid

1319
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,239
If you're listening to this

1320
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,335
And now Alex's and complain about everyone

1321
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,943
Two of the western person is going down like a lead

1322
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
Zeppelin

1323
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
We got a bunch of zombie like

1324
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,391
People raging

1325
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Or web page website

1326
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
On what page is

1327
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,935
When we come back election

1328
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,287
Giant special it is there it is

1329
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,847
July special

1330
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
It's not

1331
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,455
Earlier

1332
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,271
Much better different day but

1333
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,575
So let's get down to business

1334
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Gives out

1335
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
The URL

1336
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
This is very good

1337
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,279
This is from the Centers for Disease Control

1338
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
Pretension

1339
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
Not wear them unless you're real

1340
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
For something hitting

1341
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
But even bigger

1342
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,991
Coronavirus disease 2009 personal protection equipment

1343
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
Questions and answers

1344
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,831
CDC

1345
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,135
Here's a URL CDC.

1346
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
2009

1347
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,743
Ncov

1348
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,047
4 / 18

1349
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,839
Or / respirator

1350
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
HTML

1351
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:16,799
Not a real URL do this to any website

1352
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,871
One thing when he says Hep it should be h

1353
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Also I can

1354
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
Reading the year

1355
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,783
If he signed 2009 which it sounds like he is

1356
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,343
Then this camping information about covid-19

1357
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,159
Possibly be about H1 N1

1358
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
Hulu

1359
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Concern that year

1360
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:39,071
I suspect he's just misreading 2019 but I'm honestly not sure

1361
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Yeah either way doesn't

1362
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
Matter

1363
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,703
And it instantly becomes clear what he's messing up here

1364
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
Play Telluride here

1365
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
Which five

1366
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
Let me

1367
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,927
The sterile field

1368
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
Other people that you're wearing it

1369
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
You got it

1370
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,935
Expose others when it do

1371
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
Nothing except

1372
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:23,615
So the first hint that he's not talking about normal facemasks is the reference to an exhaust valve

1373
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:32,063
No I'm pretty sure I know cuz I know references made us

1374
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,415
Masks with valves

1375
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,695
Which are different from cloth

1376
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,047
Umask typically have a mechanism which opens when the where

1377
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Defeats the purpose

1378
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,119
If you were I wearing that

1379
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,423
The goal is to contain droplets

1380
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,031
Which could infect other people that opened every time you exhale

1381
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,943
He sort of masks are specifically designed as protective to the wearer with no concern for what the wearer might be putting back into

1382
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
The environment

1383
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:05,087
Be specific sort of masks with valves typically for using industrial settings Orion Construction

1384
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
Well the n95 mask

1385
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,183
That healthcare workers

1386
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
Same

1387
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
So they don't risk

1388
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
Patients getting sick while

1389
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,839
Okay so Alex grabs

1390
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,655
The one example of

1391
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,727
The CDC literally you actually saying like

1392
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,287
Here's the max you should wear and here's the mask

1393
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Shouldn't

1394
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:31,455
Reporting on how you should wear these

1395
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
In spite of covid-19

1396
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
19

1397
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
In 30 seconds on Google I was able to find a phone article

1398
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
Explaining that you should

1399
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
You just not use these

1400
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,743
There was the Daily Mail back on April 28th

1401
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:49,375
Insider on May 28th space company from April 28th Boston

1402
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
There's plenty more

1403
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:56,031
This is old news and Alex's pretending it's a bombshell

1404
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,127
Weird Masters effective in stopping particles and droplets

1405
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
Spreading from your mouth endo's

1406
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,223
This efficacy drops when you haven't

1407
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,807
Exhalation valve it opens up and lets out these particles

1408
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
This is common sense

1409
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,391
And there's nobody got your moment

1410
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,439
The guidance to wear masks

1411
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,791
These specific types are not effective for these purposes that are not recommended

1412
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,863
You could wear medical n95 mask

1413
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
Because those need to be direct

1414
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,727
Did the medical professionals who need them boards

1415
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Can you do

1416
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Very simple

1417
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,591
Or unable to the approximately

1418
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,663
2 minutes of work that would be required to report on this correct

1419
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,247
I think if it's not laziness or inability that creates

1420
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
It's that will

1421
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,367
Knows that the blurb he's reading has nothing to do with normal Mass reading

1422
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
He's just intentionally lying

1423
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
Pretend it's related

1424
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
How could you

1425
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
And read

1426
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
Valves

1427
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,327
Wait what

1428
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
Does this mean

1429
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Literally hurting

1430
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Listening

1431
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
Into you

1432
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
This is premeditated

1433
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,967
This is Criminal negligence

1434
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Premeditated

1435
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,039
You're somebody who

1436
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
Alex's legit

1437
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
Stop

1438
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,159
And you're listening to him read this thing about this

1439
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
CDC

1440
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,719
And their masks with valves

1441
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,999
You're not thinking like

1442
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
No mask I've ever seen

1443
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:28,703
People wearing generally when I go down to the grocery store.

1444
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:35,359
What the f*** he's talked about maybe I should look into

1445
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:40,479
Patrick Swayze survive this situation

1446
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,527
They do recommend

1447
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,367
So Alex gets complaining about

1448
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,439
I was just

1449
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Primarily

1450
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:54,047
How's they want to get involved

1451
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,911
Vaccine development in this particular case

1452
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,447
Andreescu

1453
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,007
The idea of countries having a bidding war

1454
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
Overview

1455
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
This vaccine

1456
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Because you could artificial

1457
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,711
Right to the point where people who were in The

1458
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
Simultaneously she's discussing

1459
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:17,343
How there are communities who have different

1460
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,135
Grades of need

1461
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
For the vax

1462
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
Maybe more pressing

1463
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Really matter

1464
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
There are six

1465
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,423
Sure workers around the world

1466
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,447
Be safe

1467
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,151
Population

1468
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:45,247
Country that would be

1469
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,295
Additions

1470
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
Okay

1471
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:59,839
Ideally there will be universal access for a potential vaccine against developed

1472
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,911
Communities aren't needed than others

1473
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
Princeton

1474
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,239
Myself

1475
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,287
But I recognize that I'm very lucky

1476
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,103
Be relatively young in relatively decent shape

1477
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
Have no pre-existing

1478
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
Conditions that put me at risk

1479
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,943
If I'm able to work from home

1480
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,783
That sucks though I would want a vaccine as soon as I can get

1481
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,927
I will gladly postpone getting one if there's a situation where people who are at higher risk than me the demographics

1482
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,719
Or because of their line of work

1483
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,767
If they need to get vaccinated first

1484
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
That's great

1485
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,839
That's basically all Melinda Gates is getting at

1486
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
It's not something nefarious

1487
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,983
Dean has been showing Betty disproportionate number of black Americans are getting covid-19

1488
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:44,383
Systemic problems that are

1489
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,663
Phenomenon like

1490
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:48,223
Over-representation in service industry

1491
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
These were social distancing a difficult Orange

1492
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,855
Predominantly black communities

1493
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
Empire incarceration

1494
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
According to a study put out by the Chicago

1495
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,535
The underlying problem

1496
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,071
Save a bunch of liars

1497
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
Which is good

1498
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:09,983
Also I'm at Melinda Gates for not including incarcerated persons on her list of people who should have a high priority

1499
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:15,616
See Jordan it's possible to agree with her underlined

1500
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
Little Park

1501
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:22,784
You know that she has a decent she fails to recognize one of the largest groups that needs

1502
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
To be helped

1503
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,880
The highest priority

1504
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
However what you're missing

1505
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,976
Is that she only mentioned

1506
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,888
Because there are the targets of the vaccine first to Kill Them All

1507
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Them outside

1508
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,240
Point Blank.

1509
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Wood

1510
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,568
You if you have a vaccine that kills

1511
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
Why would you first give it

1512
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,640
To help.

1513
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,688
That makes no sense

1514
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,296
Right and then our terrible before she says people who work at

1515
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
Grocery stores in

1516
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
Be packing plants

1517
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,976
Suffolk that are also considered in her wave of like see people who are in the most

1518
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,304
Stupid Alex is just trying

1519
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Find to race bait

1520
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:17,056
Interesting to me that he never really bothered to learn what her name is

1521
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
Who's running the health department

1522
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,408
In Seattle in 1983

1523
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,480
And I was on the board

1524
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,576
He was a banker

1525
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
She was the first

1526
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
Woman on

1527
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
Major corporate board United States

1528
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,280
Husband

1529
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
What is mrs.

1530
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
Bill Gates

1531
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,664
Mother is named Marianne Maxwell mrs. Bill Gates

1532
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,296
Cuz he married his mother

1533
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
Back in 1975

1534
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,648
Then she's from South Africa

1535
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
Number two

1536
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,000
So good on her

1537
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,584
In 1983 she became the first female head of the United Way

1538
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,608
That's what I was

1539
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,656
She never ran the Seattle health

1540
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
Department which it actually isn't

1541
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
Nothing

1542
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,800
There's the King County Public Health Department

1543
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,360
Department of Health but I don't know what Alex is talking about

1544
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:28,992
You claiming the Bill Gates mom ran a thing that you got the name of wrong and he can't even be bothered to know her name

1545
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,064
Isabel just doesn't give a f*** about a incredible at all

1546
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:38,464
Except whatever so did you know that mrs. Bill Gates

1547
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,280
Who created covid

1548
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,352
Did you know that

1549
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
I got to go

1550
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,400
Alright alright

1551
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
So Alex

1552
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,496
Skip's another guest this is weird

1553
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
Amazing

1554
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Was good

1555
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,368
Read no one else wants to go on my show anymore

1556
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,184
Yaser Alex

1557
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,744
Before and he's like

1558
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,816
No matter what show you're doing

1559
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,888
I mean

1560
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
Could be fun

1561
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,008
Like if you're having a show where like

1562
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
I don't know

1563
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,152
You know Chris gethard

1564
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,272
Yeah Alexander

1565
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
Not bad

1566
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
This is

1567
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,904
Infected can be transcended

1568
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,256
Text talks about that

1569
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
This guy

1570
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,096
Great genius

Rebel sadrian Church

1572
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
I'm just going to be straight up

1573
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,216
I see people with mask on

1574
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,800
Understand

1575
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,128
And give site

1576
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
To the blind so

1577
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
If he wasn't scared to touch

1578
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,272
Coronavirus map

1579
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Come to me

1580
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:12,672
For you I stand in the Gap right now

1581
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
Images Clarence of Jesus

1582
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,912
I'm more concerned about this

1583
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Denial

1584
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
You know like

1585
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,008
Just sort of a

1586
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,848
There is no cure for anything other than

1587
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:35,200
You have to first allow the virus into your body

1588
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:39,040
Well that is true

1589
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,576
Which you should have done

1590
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,648
And if you would just taking my $6,000 a month course

1591
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,952
You would never have done that we are like

1592
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
Really close to snake

1593
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,888
Lightning is why you got sick

1594
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,936
Yeah so

1595
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,496
Stephanie has another guest

1596
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,264
And I did

1597
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,288
Give a

1598
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,176
Come over all without you

1599
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,712
Right now.

1600
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,272
He saw why he did it in

1601
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,808
Where he thinks this is all going

1602
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,112
Thank you so much for coming on

1603
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
Iowa.

1607
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,304
You obviously sacrifice your job a lot more

1608
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:29,984
What is another project Veritas

1609
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,568
So whatever comments I had about the first guy

1610
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:37,408
Apply them here

1611
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:41,248
I will say this guy

1612
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,040
Because

1613
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,088
Is GoFundMe

1614
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:49,696
He's not making nearly as much as the other guy

1615
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,816
When I checked out but it was only like 45

1616
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,680
I don't think

1617
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:06,080
I don't think either of them are going to hit their hundred fifty thousand gold

1618
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,152
You don't you don't want to be

1619
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,992
This guy is going to have just as much

1620
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Like

1621
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,320
Google ability for future jobs

1622
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,112
And stuff he wants to try and

1623
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,440
If you just Google his name you'll now come up with a bunch of

1624
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,976
Project

1625
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
And he's not even give the payout

1626
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
The other dude

1627
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
You just

1628
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,984
So

1629
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,008
I don't care about you

1630
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
That Alex has it

1631
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,688
Coming up this weekend

1632
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Talk about that here

1633
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
This Sunday I know Texas capitals outside

1634
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,280
Stupid racist bowl-shaped

1635
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
The name

1636
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
I wanted to play that clip because

1637
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,984
Since the last episode recorded

1638
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,848
Oh boy Alex posted an article with the headline

1639
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,152
Newmar New Movement hijacked

1640
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:16,224
I can't breathe meme to protest masks in public

1641
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,856
The first is that before they had any events

1642
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,672
Before there's any

1643
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
A movement

1644
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,488
There's no

1645
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
Grassroots

1646
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,352
Sad

1647
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
Satyr is back

1648
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,680
I can't breathe

1649
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:45,152
I understand that he's a racist an opportunist but even struggle to release

1650
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,368
You would think the basic human decency would stop you from taking multiple people's Last Words as they were being killed by police

1651
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
Just use them for your unrelated

1652
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Publicity stunt

1653
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
There's a coherent

1654
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
When black lives matter protest

1655
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
I can

1656
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,608
Free or they use that term on a side

1657
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:09,728
They're protesting against police brutality which is the reason those words were uttered in the first

1658
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
It makes sense

1659
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,336
It's not in the sense that Alex uses that word

1660
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,616
It's a distillation of

1661
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
The protest message

1662
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
Brings to the Forefront the seriousness

1663
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,480
A big issue being protest

1664
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:27,648
Galaxy seems to think that because he believes that they're just demonic globalist opportunistically using George Floyd's

1665
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,696
Stephan order to usher in a dictatorship

1666
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,720
You can just use the

1667
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,000
The power of those words

1668
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,048
And then use them for his own purposes

1669
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:38,144
We fail to understand is that much like Thor's hammer

1670
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,680
This is a weapon he can't

1671
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
And the words have no power

1672
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,056
His attempts to harness what's behind these words

1673
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
But he thinks or just a meme

1674
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
Is desperation and his cravenness

1675
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:53,248
This probably wouldn't be enough to just by talking about this again

1676
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,552
But I thought there was something hilarious about the

1677
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
Disposed

1678
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,880
Alex is really trying to pretend that he didn't

1679
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Start this whole thing

1680
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,208
The article begins quote

1681
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:08,608
Freedom lovers in Texas have launched we can't breathe out of here

1682
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:13,216
Trying to act like he trying to create

1683
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,264
God what a f****** dick

1684
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,360
Third person

1685
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
Freedom lover

1686
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,968
Who will be attending

1687
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,808
However they slip up and start using the first person we

1688
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,600
About halfway through the post

1689
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,256
Stupid

1690
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
But they're trying to mask

1691
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,560
Pun intended

1692
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:46,496
I think that they've probably learned it when they do things that are Infowars branded is a little too true

1693
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,824
Trying a different approach

1694
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,360
I want to say that

1695
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,896
This is super Dane

1696
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,992
On Saturday the Austin american-statesman reported that quote

1697
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Austin Hill

1698
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:03,392
Health officials last week saw the highest rate of positive coronavirus test of any Metro area in the

1699
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:10,304
Austin mayor Steve Adler Warren quote if you venture out know that you are multiples more likely to get

1700
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,328
Infected today

1701
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,352
Then two weeks ago

1702
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
Facilitate

1703
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
If you wanted to

1704
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,336
I saw some videos earlier today from the feeds of Alex's protest

1705
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,664
There may be a few hundred people there I'm

1706
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
My estimate

1707
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,248
It was a horrible turnout compared to other

1708
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016
Recent protests

1709
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:36,160
What part of Alex's planned is really slow and kind of funny when you think about it is there's a giant

1710
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Gate in front of the governor's mansion

1711
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,048
So you just had a bunch of people outside of gate without yelling a bunch of

1712
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,352
Phrases into a PA system

1713
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:48,192
During Alex's speech of the camera person Panda round the audience

1714
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,336
Depressing disappointing for him

1715
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
And hopefully doesn't end

1716
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
Killing anyone

1717
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,456
Favorite does that

1718
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
That's on him

1719
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,784
A clip that literally on her

1720
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,624
I mean you literally said mask-wearing is discouraged

1721
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,464
Kill them

1722
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,744
If somebody dies

1723
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
Who is that that rallies

1724
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
This might kill them

1725
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,608
He didn't

1726
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,168
Freedom lovers in Texas

1727
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:24,288
Okay I like maybe this is

1728
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,104
Dodge culpability in the possibility that there are some

1729
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,712
Some negative outcome so funny to me that he tries to co-opt

1730
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:34,016
Like other right-wing

1731
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:38,368
Protests in and make them about him and this time now he's trying to call up

1732
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,648
His own protest

1733
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,768
To make it about him and act like it's not

1734
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,096
So

1735
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Alex

1736
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
Embarrassed

1737
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
Someone to admire

1738
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,264
Course on our last episode Alex.

1739
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,592
I was talking about

1740
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
Speck in the sea

1741
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,200
Edward Griffin

1742
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,784
He is a weirdo of the highest order

1743
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,576
And

1744
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,648
Because of the popularity

1745
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:15,232
60s was getting traffic to rounded

1746
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:21,120
All these social media

1747
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
From

1748
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,496
G Edward Griffin

1749
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,776
Does not have a problem with Alex

1750
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,848
Cuz Alex going to Wayback Hayden Federal Reserve

1751
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,248
And you know

1752
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:40,832
They know each other from Ron polish Circle

1753
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,456
Do things together

1754
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,464
Immigration vaccine

1755
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
Directions

1756
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,096
Google

1757
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,680
I don't want to

1758
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,728
Please

1759
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,520
I'm talking with a gif

1760
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:39,712
Talking to someone I can't disrespect was troubling

1761
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:46,112
But I want him to use the military

1762
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,392
Guess what

1763
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,232
Because he doesn't want to talk about that

1764
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,816
Easy slam dunk

1765
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,096
Abortion

1766
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
Directions

1767
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:08,640
Yumeko by not able to talk A-Rod

1768
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
These these

1769
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
Passage there

1770
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:21,696
Really interesting here is of course I was talking s*** about the Democrat

1771
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,232
It is not

1772
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,280
When I got other people have the same

1773
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,608
That's a good question

1774
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,032
Maybe they really don't intend to

1775
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
Maybe they

1776
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,408
For some reason they want

1777
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,296
That's horrible.

1778
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,304
So now you g Edward Griffin

1779
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,608
Globalist

1780
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
President

1781
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,872
Is anathema

1782
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,432
He said for the last 45 years

1783
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:19,296
Cannot coexist with that idea

1784
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:25,696
G Edward Griffin wrote the beast from Jekyll Island

1785
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
Early

1786
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
Never meet your Heroes

1787
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,840
Not handle this

1788
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
So

1789
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
It leads to

1790
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,936
Probably wanted

1791
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,240
Embarrassing things I've ever heard Alex

1792
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
Deal under Obama

1793
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,360
Started

1794
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
And for

1795
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,432
Global Assault Apopka

1796
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:55,136
And then we can negotiate better with China for a better deal

1797
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,440
Even know this but he's been putting in

1798
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
A broker to get China to come to heal with

1799
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
Hitler and Stalin together

1800
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,312
Who is that

1801
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,640
What are you doing buddy is trying to be popular and he's in there

1802
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,200
You trying to gauge everything any drawn from a swamp

1803
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:29,952
So if you need an indication that I was having a bad time with this interview it's really just said that

1804
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
Wow

1805
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:35,072
Which Alex

1806
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,656
Invalidation of literally

1807
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
Everything

1808
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,496
First contradiction is at the globalist

1809
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:46,592
You were supposed to have been working tooth-and-nail to stop Trump from winning the election

1810
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
They carried out election fraud

1811
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,760
Obama spied on Trump

1812
01:36:54,272 --> 01:37:00,416
But now Alex's suggesting that the globalists there was populism

1813
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,000
That's a gigantic problem for Alice's narrative because

1814
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,536
If that's what he believes

1815
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:10,656
Email us to find an explanation for the last 4 years

1816
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:13,472
Globo's decided to step aside and let Trump in

1817
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:18,336
Is Alex ready to admit he was making up everything about people being bussed in to vote

1818
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:21,920
Is he ready to admit that there wasn't a grand conspiracy to enjoy

1819
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,968
Craft Trump Associates that led to

1820
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,624
I would imagine he's not because he knows the G ever Griffin

1821
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,464
Isn't just going to blindly go along with

1822
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,024
G Edward Griffin doesn't need Alex's dumbass

1823
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,072
He's a legend of anti-communism

1824
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,120
Jim

1825
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:48,032
The second big contradiction In that clip is at the globalist decided to get Trump into office to get a better negotiating position with China

1826
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
And also they're trying to kill him

1827
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
Simultaneous

1828
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,992
Problem here is that according to Alex to go blistering bed with

1829
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,880
They're basically partners and all the evil plans Alex yelled about all the time

1830
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,416
Idiot president

1831
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,720
In order to get a better negotiating position

1832
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,768
If there was some gold

1833
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:18,752
All the surface this is nonsense but I was just saying

1834
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,080
You're not very short clip Alex's directly contradicted

1835
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,640
A giant part of his shows mythology

1836
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Also

1837
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,968
Not ignored

1838
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,992
I think Trump is Hitler

1839
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,016
Yeah yes

1840
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:36,416
If you assume China is the standing for Poland to sides are negotiating about intellect the globalist

1841
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,280
Obviously

1842
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,816
Which of these Trump as Hitler

1843
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,120
Seems like a bad thing for Alex

1844
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:47,424
He is a white nationalist

1845
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,496
Alex doesn't mean

1846
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:56,640
He's just trying to appease this legendary anti-communist gas

1847
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,664
Who clearly doesn't

1848
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,992
Any pics

1849
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
Alex is bending the knee to Griffin

1850
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,344
Because he knows he can't defend his position

1851
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,488
Any far-right than him

1852
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:12,768
More willing

1853
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,304
To just go directly at it

1854
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:26,336
Is Alex he's not going to try and maintain his relationship

1855
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,688
And I think he's full of s***

1856
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:35,808
I will say everything I understand about him

1857
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,392
So like I don't

1858
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,232
Going to pee

1859
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,512
Oh yeah

1860
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,304
Alex Auld

1861
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,096
Yes and with you

1862
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,192
Nothing matters

1863
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:55,520
And so when G Edward Griffin gives him some sort of push back on like

1864
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:59,360
Yeah you know because the establishment in the globalist

1865
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:03,968
What Trump to be in power Alex create an entirely new line

1866
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,528
Instant Natasha Desai

1867
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:10,880
Whatever gets me out of narcissistic psychopath

1868
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,696
How could you suppose that be if you listen to be shown

1869
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,512
I don't know I don't know

1870
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:22,656
Yeah I just don't know I don't know how anybody could listen to the show without experiencing some serious

1871
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:26,752
Something in your brain has two

1872
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:31,872
You have to give up

1873
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
And

1874
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,480
Submit these as

1875
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
One reason

1876
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Alex

1877
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,320
God one reason from G Edward Griffin

1878
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,112
Nobody should ever support

1879
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,208
They're not necessarily being presented as bad thing

1880
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
Which I think

1881
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
Weird

1882
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,536
Yours yours Alex

1883
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:50,816
Looking at rum

1884
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,680
You got to know how manipulative

1885
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:58,240
Come out and say Bill Gates is more powerful than him

1886
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,520
Emily the president

1887
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,288
Marshall

1888
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,968
The problem with Trump is literally

1889
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,528
If we just run headlines that Bill Gates is more

1890
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
He's one of the president then trouble stopping

1891
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,904
Which we need we should say no

1892
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,696
He's killing people he's evil

1893
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,488
He's a globality vagina

1894
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:27,936
He's a baby that he's a gullible morons

1895
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,216
Loud it is

1896
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:35,360
Easy to manipulate the president of the United States who has nuclear weapons

1897
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
Hugo and his appeal to the presidency go and then he will crush your enemies

1898
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:46,880
Drop that guy over there says he's stronger than you like what can you do

1899
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:53,280
How do you think that's the president a man with an iron will incorruptible

1900
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:59,680
You can just say anything to him and make him feel into insecure and then Oak Hill

1901
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,544
Oh man

1902
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,896
I would say there's almost no more compelling argument for like

1903
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,456
Not voting for him

1904
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:18,112
There's that there's no more compelling argument for me

1905
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,160
You think that that's a possibility

1906
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,560
Well this is my first this guy

1907
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:31,168
Because obviously he's not saying that there's like a necessary lie like a great

1908
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:35,776
You saying it is because one of his human failings look we all have lines

1909
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
That's a big

1910
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,848
That might be the biggest one you could

1911
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,616
Right

1912
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,040
Basically be the president

1913
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Situation

1914
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,648
Synergy

1915
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,952
He has his own thing

1916
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,024
President for many decades

1917
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,792
Is not

1918
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,584
His own authority

1919
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,144
He takes directions

1920
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,496
Text directions

1921
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
Billions of dollars

1922
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,920
Text directions from people who

1923
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
Call the Deep state

1924
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:25,440
Even though he's out there saying he's against the

1925
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:34,144
Good pivot therealak City don't want to talk about

1926
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,240
Billionaire donors

1927
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:43,104
A boy that sounds like something that everybody's known forever

1928
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,480
Connor

1929
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,528
We're just going on

1930
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,808
What are we

1931
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
Legacy

1932
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,304
Type guys

1933
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,352
Sounds unless so because

1934
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:10,240
Most of his credibility come through being related to W Cleon skousen

1935
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,848
His own accord

1936
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,432
And so the conversation of the two of them have theirs

1937
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,712
Entire power imbalance

1938
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,760
Because also Diego different

1939
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,320
As interested as someone like Steve pieczenik

1940
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:28,928
And just abusing Alex

1941
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,816
Griffin has his own

1942
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,888
He has his own books that he sells

1943
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,680
He doesn't need Alex's a promotion

1944
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,752
The dynamic there is

1945
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:45,312
Pretty fascinating and I think Alex comes out

1946
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,336
Strongly

1947
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,104
Oh yeah

1948
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,152
I would find that to be

1949
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,688
If I

1950
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,736
After work that day

1951
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,016
And I was Alex and I was like

1952
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,296
I just f******

1953
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,320
Inset on-air that the

1954
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:59,392
Globalist wanted Trump to win and maybe they

1955
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,184
Only using him to get a better

1956
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,232
Bargaining position with

1957
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
A globe

1958
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,728
It sounds like Alex is taking this out of the glove

1959
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
I don't know man

1960
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:18,336
It's sad

1961
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,384
On your side of town

1962
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:26,784
Yeah we'll see what happens

1963
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,832
Next episode

1964
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:39,840
That's the best rally anyone ever seen

1965
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,632
Yeah I look forward to that quite a bit

1966
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,960
Next episode

1967
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:51,360
Ross on Twitter

1968
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:02,624
You could please find a local charity

1969
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
I need a loan.

1970
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,768
Omio I believe

1971
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,096
G Edward Griffin

1972
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,888
The Griffin is the mythical animal

1973
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:21,568
Alex
